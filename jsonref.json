It is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall, which William will inherit when Charles becomes King. Then William will be his father\u0027s landlord, taking £700,000 a year rent.In London, Charles\u0027s official Clarence House residence was originally earmarked for Harry but his departure to California means that is \u0027no longer on the cards\u0027.It is now more likely to be saved for Prince George, Princess Charlotte or Prince Louis, although its outdated decor is a turn-off for younger Royals. A source said: \u0027No one is terribly fond of Clarence House because it\u0027s still seen very much as the Queen Mother\u0027s place.\u0027Charles intends to keep another of his grandmother\u0027s properties – Birkhall in Scotland, which he inherited on her death in 2002 and one of the few places where he is said to feel at home. It is part of the Balmoral Estate, the Queen\u0027s favourite residence. Balmoral\u0027s grounds and gardens are closed to the public in the summer when she is in residence but under Charles, there is set to be far greater access. A source said: \u0027The talk is of opening a museum paying tribute to the Queen.\u0027Even Sandringham in Norfolk, which is privately owned by the Royal Family, might be opened up to the public when Charles inherits it. Wood Farm, the cottage in the grounds where Prince Philip spent his latter years, could be mothballed for future generations.The Cambridges look set to keep Anmer Hall, the nearby mansion which the Queen gave them after their 2011 wedding and also stand to inherit Llwynywermod, the Welsh home of the Prince of Wales."},{"url":null,"title":"175k collectible James Bond coin solid gold raffled just 5 ticket","story":"Share this article Since tickets became available last week more than 1,000 have already been snapped up by people desperate to get their hands on the rare item.The two-kilo coin is currently in secure storage at a secret location.To find out more visit britanniacoincompany.comjames-bond-2-kilo-gold-coin-raffle.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Dog Bounty Hunter wades waist deep Florida swamp waters hunt Brian Laundrie","story":"Share this articleTime and environmental factors are complicating the search for Brian Laundrie, experts say - CNNFox News news \u0026amp latest pictures from Newsweek.comDog the Bounty Hunter working to confirm tip on Brian Laundrie"},{"url":null,"title":"From Claudia Schiffer Shakira rich famous faces caught Pandora Papers leak","story":"Share this articleOffshore havens and hidden riches of world leaders and billionaires exposed in unprecedented leak - ICIJ"},{"url":null,"title":"Met adding hundreds officers streets Sarah Everard case","story":"Share this article He added that making streets safer was part of making women and girls feel more safe.He told the BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \u0027We are putting (in) more CCTV, better street lighting. \u0027But what you\u0027ve got to do is address the underlying frustration of millions of women, and millions of people across the country, at the slowness of the criminal justice system and the inadequacy of the justice system in dealing with crimes of rape and domestic violence and sexual violence.\u0027And the UK crime and policing minister, Kit Malthouse, told Sky News he accepted there was a problem with violence against women in the UK and said the reason for a fall in rape convictions was \u0027complicated\u0027.He added: \u0027We are very focused on this issue and we\u0027ve pledged to try and drive these numbers up, to try to restore that institutional confidence and people coming forward.\u0027The confidence of people coming forward to report that crime has increased very significantly over the last four or five years.Last month a court heard how policeman Wayne Couzens used Covid laws to stop, handcuff and stage the fake arrest of Sarah Everard before strangling her.Couzens cuffed the 33-year-old marketing executive\u0027s hands behind her back, leaving her incapable of undoing the seatbelt he strapped around her after ordering her into the back of his rental car.He then raped and murdered her before burning her body in a pre-meditated attack.The court heard in chilling evidence how earlier in the night, the killer had spent two hours driving through central and south London - prowling Kensington, Lavender Hill and Earls Court for a lone young woman to abduct.   In September, 36-year-old Koci Selamaj, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, was charged with the murder of primary school teacher Sabina Nessa, 28. Ms Nessa was killed as she walked through Cator Park in Kidbrooke, south-east London, on her way to meet a friend on September 17.Her body was found nearly 24 hours later covered with leaves near a community centre in the park. It is claimed her attacker used a 2ft long weapon to strike her repeatedly before carrying her away unconscious.    "},{"url":null,"title":"Facebook outage Zuckerberg apologises site come online","story":"Share this articleJonathan Zittrain on Twitter: \u0026quotAstounding to see that Facebook basically locked its keys in the car.… \u0026quot"},{"url":null,"title":"Butlins Bognor Regis resort evacuated army bomb squad called","story":"Share this article The leaflets feature the picture of desperate refugees crammed into a US military plane taken during the evacuation of Kabul with slogans \u0027Put British people first!\u0027 and \u0027Charity starts at home!\u0027 in bold text.In a statement issued yesterday, North Yorkshire Police said the cordon had been lifted, adding: \u0027At 10.15am this morning the hotel received a telephone call with what has now been proven to be a bomb hoax.

Rapid rises in fuel, energy and staff costs were passed on to customers in September, with the ‘rate of prices charged inflation’ accelerating sharply to the highest since the data began in July 1996.  That’s according to the latest IHS MarkitCIPS UK Services PMI, a closely-watched survey that tracks the economy. Service sector businesses “widely noted” that supply problems, higher transport costs and rising salary payments had all added to inflationary pressures, as customer demand recovered.  That may show that firms are lifting pay to attract and retain staff. It also suggests that the surge in gas prices, ongoing shipping delays and transport problems due to a shortage of HGV drivers are driving up costs. Many services firms blamed the fall in new orders on staff shortages, supply issues and the end of the stamp duty holiday (which had spurred the housing market). Some companies, particularly in the hospitality sector, reported a fall in activity caused by supply chain disruptions and shortages of staff. The PMI survey also found that employment growth slowed, due to lack of candidates to fill vacancies, and persistently high numbers of departing staff. Worryingly, some companies also reported they’d made redundancies as the furlough scheme ended last week. Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, says companies are passing their rising costs onto consumers: Last month’s fuel shortages and panic buying could spur more people to buy electric vehicles, Fairclough adds: Supply issues caused by semiconductor shortages “continue to plague” the industry, says the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which calculates the data. September is typically the second busiest month of the year for the industry, due to the autumn plate change. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, said reduced availability of semiconductors is hurting the auto sector. High street bakers Greggs has pledged that its sausage rolls are safe, despite the crisis in the UK’s food industry due to a lack of butchers. Whiteside was speaking after Greggs lifted its profit forecasts for this year, after a strong summer partly boosted by a ‘staycation’ effect in August. But, Greggs also warned that it is struggling to get hold of some ingredients -- and that prices are rising. In a BBC Breakfast interview, Johnson said the government asked the road haulage industry to provide the names of foreign drivers who would want to come to the UK, and that only 127 names have been produced so far. He said this proved what the government has been saying about the HGV driver shortage in the UK being part of a global problem. It means only a fraction of the 300 visas available for HGV drivers in the fuel industry are set to be taken up, in a setback to efforts to replenish supplies. In total, 5,000 visas are available to overseas drivers. Andrew Sparrow’s Politics Live blog has full details of the PM’s interviews this morning: UK engineering group Melrose has been hit by a surge in cancelled orders, as the global chip shortages hit carmakers. Melrose’s automotive clients are cancelling orders at 25 times the rate seen earlier this year, due to supply chain issues gripping the industry. Melrose owns GKN, which supplies parts for the automotive industry including modular eDrives (used in electric cars), all-wheel drive systems and drivelines (which transfer power from the engine to the wheels). But if its customers can’t get hold of semiconductors -- to control everything from digital displays and navigation systems to emergency braking and stability control systems -- that hits their demand for other parts. Melrose chief executive Simon Peckham says the chip shortages are frustrating, and hard to plan for: September has proved a cruel month for UK car dealers, as the global shortages of semiconductors hits the auto sector. That would be the weakest September for at least 23 years, Reuters says, as the industry struggles with supply chain problems following the pandemic. September is normally a strong time for car sales, with motorists keen to get hold of a new number plate showing they have the latest model (they update in the spring and autumn).  But the global shortage of semiconductors is continuing to hurt production across the automotive industry, leaving dealers struggling to get hold of models to sell to consumers.  But as Reuters explains, electric car sales hit a new record (in a month that ended with motorists queuing for fuel). Worries about the cost of living squeeze, and the move towards remote working, may also be weighing on car sales. But, fewer cars on the roads - especially fossil-fuelled models - might help the UK hit its target of becoming net zero by 2050. We get the full data at 9am UK time. The energy crunch continue, with US oil prices hitting their highest levels in seven years last night after Opec and its allies resisted pressure to speed up their crude production. That could feed through to higher energy costs this winter, and prices at the pumps. The UK’s petrol crisis is easing, with military drivers now helping to get fuel to forecourts. But problems remain, particularly in London and the South East, so it could take a week to return to normality. We also get new healthchecks on UK, eurozone and US service sector companies this morning, which will show the impact of supply chain problems.

Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose. Anyone over the age of 12 can\u0026nbsp now register for a vaccine.

One arrived in a grey fleece and pyjama bottoms and was carrying a teddy bear under her arm.One father said: I\u0027m absolutely sick of it. It\u0027s not hard to get dressed in the morning.

He probably felt snubbed,” a defence source said, speaking to The Daily .Mrs Holmes said her husband was “courageous” and “committed his life to serving in the Royal Marines”. She added that “he was selfless to such an extent that this was more important than his own career progression”. She said: “Matt took the immense responsibility for the lives of those he served alongside very seriously not a day would go by without him thinking of the men under his command who were lost or injured and, of course, their families.”It is understood that Maj Gen Holmes was removed as the head of the Royal Marines, even though he had appealed for the role to remain a two-star position. However, he was replaced by Lieutenant General Rob Magowan, who was deputy commander of UK strategic command. His sister, Sarah, said at the time of her brother’s death he was unsure what the future held for him, as he was on a three-month transition period to prepare him for his new life after the military.MailOnline reported her as saying: “He wasn’t sure what the future held for him and that didn’t help matters. He was hoping that he could stay in the Armed Forces and that the Royal Navy would create a new role for him, but nothing had emerged so far.Matt was dedicated to the Armed Forces but was preparing now to take a new job on civvy street, although he had no work lined up and didn’t know what he’d do. It created a lot of uncertainty and didn’t help with his overall situation.”Maj Gen Holmes, who was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his leadership on the front line in Afghanistan in 2007 and carried Prince Philip’s coffin at his funeral, went on to perform a new role which involved helping Royal Marine recruits with their wellbeing.Yesterday, Boris Johnson wrote on Twitter that he was “very saddened to learn of the death of Maj Gen Matt Holmes”. He said: “My thoughts are with Matt’s family and friends at this difficult time, as well as the Royal Marines and Royal Navy who I know will feel this loss keenly.”The defence source added: “No matter who you are and what you do, you can still have a bad day. Senior people aren’t immune to mental problems.”It is understood that Maj Gen Holmes was in the middle of a orce from his wife Lea, a solicitor and mother of their two children.Johnny Mercer, the former defence minister, said: “The fight for better mental health requires a relentless commitment. I hope that this brings home to senior officers that nobody is immune from these challenges.”   More from NewsConservative Party conference latest: Get back to work in the normal way or you\u0026#39ll miss out, says Boris JohnsonBoris Johnson tells BBC’s Dan Walker: \u0026#39It should be Strictly Come Vaccinated\u0026#39At least 330,000 children suffered sex abuse at hands of French Catholic Church, inquiry findsAnti-Tory hysteria is getting out of handRussia beats Tom Cruise in race to shoot first movie in spaceChina is threatening the island of Taiwan with nuclear bombers - how worried should we be?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cress friendly force change met","story":"Beleaguered is an over-used word to describe a public figure facing the wrath of an outraged public, but it’s one of the many words that can be used to describe accurately the position the Commissioner of the politan Police finds herself in.Dame Cressida Dick doesn’t appear to realise that she has become institutionalised. She’s worked in the Met for so long that she cannot see the wood for the trees. She leads an organisation that is more or less immune to radical change and reform, and she doesn’t have the emotional intelligence to lead from the front and implement what’s necessary.I’m told the main reason why Dame Cressida was reappointed to the job by Priti Patel and Sadiq Khan was because there was no one else. What an indictment.There’s no doubt that she is liked by her colleagues. Being liked is an advantage for any leader, but sometimes familiarity breeds contempt. Astonishingly, her staff and advisers do not call her “Commissioner”. She’s widely referred to as “Cress”. Does anyone really imagine her predecessors in the job would have allowed that? In his book, Gavin Barwell, Theresa May’s, former chief of staff, points out that he had known her as “Theresa” for 20 years, but as soon as he was appointed to that job in 2017, she became “Prime Minister”.And quite right too. Leaders can’t be friends.Over the decades and centuries, the Tories have always found an issue to cause a schism. First it was the corn laws, then tariff reform. Later came appeasement, “Butskellism”, “Powellism”, “Thatcherism” and of course, latterly, Europe. As I write this at the conference in Manchester, I detect another split brewing, this time between the low-tax, small-state Tories and those who believe that in the post-Brexit and Covid world the role of the state will be crucial in enabling the economy to recover and grow, and that the key to winning elections is to use the power of the state to improve public services.At a fringe meeting I chaired on Sunday, Jacob Rees-Mogg maintained that the Tory party was still the party of low taxes, a small state and free enterprise. The record tells us something different. We have the highest tax burden since the 1960s, the state seems to encroach more and more on all aspects of our lives and we have Treasury ministers who seem to think that IR35 and the Loan Charge will encourage the entrepreneurial spirit rather than what they actually do, which is to stifle it.IR35, an attempt to squeeze more money out of the self-employed, has been a disastrous sledgehammer which hasn’t just cracked the nut, it’s smashed it to smithereens as tens of thousands of people have been forced to abandon their work of decades – including thousands of lorry drivers. What we need are Treasury ministers who will stand up to the mandarins in their own department and HMRC and say bluntly “up with this, we will not put”.Too often in the past, they’ve gone native. Too often the Treasury has been staffed by ministers with little knowledge of experience of business and free enterprise. I hope the Chancellor will look again at both IR35 and the Loan Charge and ask himself if these are really measures that a true Conservative can support.This is my 36th Conservative Party conference. Over the years they have changed in a number of ways. Gone are the nights we would wake up sweating in beds in Blackpool B\u0026ampBs and find out we were sleeping on incontinence sheets. Gone are the days when conference goers could actually make speeches from the floor and take on government ministers. Gone, it seems too, are the blue-rinse brigade.In Manchester this week it’s noticeable that the most visible demographic is the 16- to 35-year-olds who are in the majority. There is one problem, however: ninety per cent of them do not appear to have a cervix.Boris Johnson is the most tricky politician to interview I have ever come across. I think Andrew Marr would probably agree. He rarely looks you in the eye, so it’s more difficult to interrupt him when he goes off on a riff about red buses, having been asked a question about China.His interview with Marr on Sunday started off well with considered answers on women’s safety, but then it just became a bluster session about HGV drivers and the unnecessary slaughter of pigs. At the time, I thought it had been a bit of a disaster for the PM, and I was traduced on social media for having had the temerity to say so.Typical Boris, though, for he’s come up smelling of roses. Almost inadvertently what emerged from the interview was a new political iding line. “Vote Tory if you want a pay rise. Vote Labour if you want more mass immigration to drive down wages.”It may be crude, but I suspect it will poll incredibly well, and it’s a very difficult one for Labour to answer.

Could the solution to the UK’s lorry driver shortage simply be a hot shower, and a cold beer over a decent meal?Last week, the HGV driver shortage was responsible for everything from ongoing fuel supply issues to the prospect of a new Winter of Discontent with supermarkets going without turkey and toys this Christmas. With Boris Johnson’s suggested three-month working visa for EU truckers given the hard shoulder, one haulage firm announced it was to pay drivers a weekly salary higher than that of MPs.But what if working conditions for those driving on British roads were more like those on the Continent?“We’ve lost those truck stops, the caffs, so drivers aren’t able to get a proper wash,” Paul Carter of Certa Logistics, a cold chain transport and logistics supplier, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme last week. “So you’ll see lorry drivers parked in lay-bys at the side of the road. Some of our drivers have to park in industrial estates to take their overnight rest. The parking facilities you’ll get at services get blocked up very quickly. If you’re finishing at 8pm, you have no chance of getting a space in a secure service or lorry park and you’ll end up on the side of the road, with no facilities.“If you’re expecting someone to sleep in their cab and not wash, it won’t matter much money you throw at them to attract them to the industry. You won’t.”Industry experts have said the lack of “luxury” lorry parks in Britain is the single “major obstacle” to attracting new truckers. It may be time to take a leaf out of France’s book – or, rather, cookbook.For more than 80 years, lorry drivers across France have had access to Relais Routiers, a network of more than 1,200 restaurants serving up affordable three-course meals (wine often included), decent shower facilities and bountiful parking for the massive trucks. For many drivers, these stop-offs are also a welcome escape from the daily solitude of life on the road.“Drivers spend their entire day alone on the motorway, but when they come in here they can be guaranteed a good meal and good conversation,” says Fatima Castilho, co-owner of Aux Routiers, a Relais Routiers 15 miles south of Paris.Indeed, on a recent visit to the nondescript 70-seat roadside restaurant, the place was popping at 8pm with a mix of lorry drivers – mostly men in their 30s and 40s – sprinkled with a few in-the-know locals.“The decor doesn’t leave much to be desired, but that’s not why you come here,” says Anthony Drevet, a 33-year-old journalist who came with a group of friends – mostly mechanics – who work nearby. “You come here first and foremost for traditional French food at a cheap price.”Drevet has a point about the decor, which could be described as minimalist at best. Several antique toy trucks sit on the shelves accompanied by vintage posters and some kitsch wall clocks. The traditional wooden ceiling panelling adds a hint of charm for anyone that notices most don’t. They’ve come to eat.For a mere €12.80 (£11), diners get a three-course meal, complete with a starter, main and dessert. Tonight’s special includes a tuna quiche, roast chicken with chips and salad, and homemade lemon meringue tart for dessert. A glass of wine costs as little as €1.50 (£1.28) extra.There are also a la carte options: eight different starters and nine traditional main courses including country paté, duck liver mousse, fish soup, tête de veau (calf’s head), white fish in Béarnaise sauce, and calf’s liver sauteed with parsley. If you’re pushing the boat out, there’s also steak.“I always go with the steak,” says Samuel Dominique, a 52-year-old lorry driver who dines at Aux Routiers at least twice a month. “And this could be great for England,” he adds, reflecting on his not so stellar memories of driving his truck in the UK a decade years ago. “There was nothing. I had to eat in gas stations. I couldn’t shower for days.” At Aux Routiers, the adjoining shower block is free to use, as is standard across the road network.  Some 4,000 copies of Le Guide des Relais Routiers, the guidebook listing all Relais Routiers, are sold in France every year. All member restaurants must also meet certain criteria to obtain the coveted red and blue “Relais Routiers” label. This includes keeping the “spirit of a relais” so that customers feel “at home”, using fresh produce and offering traditional French cuisine, keeping menu prices below 14 euros, providing washing facilities and offering ample parking for the lorries. More than 60 of the Relais Routiers have also been given gold-star distinction, with a tiny casserole symbol distinguishing them as a cut above.The “ace caff with a nice hot shower attached” concept dates back to 1934 when François de Saulieu, a journalist for the now-defunct newspaper Paris-Midi, was assigned a piece about working conditions for lorry drivers. Struck by the solitude of the profession, de Saulieu and a colleague launched a magazine that was the basis for the official guidebook.If the loneliness of the long-distance lorry driver de Saulieu’s prime motivation, by any measure his enterprise has been a success. “It’s certainly friendlier to lorry drivers than any other kind of restaurant,” says Castilho. Mingling with strangers would be thought of as unusual at most French establishments, but at a Relais Routiers it’s almost expected.“You never feel alone in one of these places,” says Regis Louiseau, a 61-year-old lorry driver who has been a regular at Aux Routiers for more than 15 years.Standing by the bar with a glass of wine in hand, Louiseau jerks his head in the direction of four friends standing in the corner next to him, who all nod in agreement.“This is our decompression zone,” says Geoffry Labaune, one of Louiseau’s colleagues. “Without these places, we would probably just be sitting alone in our trucks at night. It wouldn’t be enough to simply call this restaurant. To us, it’s so much more.”“We get British lorry drivers all the time and they love it here,” says Castilho, adding he was surprised that a similar concept didn’t already exist in the UK.During the first wave of Covid-19, government restrictions forced the Relais Routiers to shut. “I had to eat gas station sandwiches from my truck,” says Dominique, adding that the only saving grace was the mini television he keeps in his truck. “At one point, I considered quitting altogether. It was a rough time.”But he says he’s happy he’s stuck it out. Relais Routiers have been fully reopened since May and lorry drivers have also been granted a special exemption from France’s health pass requirement, meaning they don’t need to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative Covid-19 test to use them.“We had a difficult year,” says Castilho, “but we managed. Now we’re back… and ready to serve.”More from NewsConservative Party conference latest: Get back to work in the normal way or you\u0026#39ll miss out, says Boris JohnsonBoris Johnson tells BBC’s Dan Walker: \u0026#39It should be Strictly Come Vaccinated\u0026#39At least 330,000 children suffered sex abuse at hands of French Catholic Church, inquiry findsAnti-Tory hysteria is getting out of handRussia beats Tom Cruise in race to shoot first movie in spaceChina is threatening the island of Taiwan with nuclear bombers - how worried should we be?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"make family members isolate pupil catches covid says teaching","story":"Family members should be made to self-isolate if a pupil has Covid, a teachers’ union has said, as they warn that siblings sharing bedrooms are spreading the virus.Under the current government guidelines, students should only stay at home if they test positive for the virus. Their close contacts – including classmates and siblings – are advised to have a PCR test but should continue going to school unless they also test positive.But the National Association of Headteachers (NAHT) has called for family members to self-isolate when a child catches Covid as they say that siblings are “actively contributing” to the spread of the virus in schools.A survey of over 1,000 union members found that almost four in five headteachers (78 per cent) do not have confidence in the Government’s Covid guidance for schools.Nearly three in 10 (28 per cent) think the NAHT should be calling for additional restrictions in schools this autumn term, while more than half (54 per cent) want to see stricter rules if there is a further rise in cases.Of those who believe current guidance for schools does not go far enough, 80 per cent want rules on self-isolation for family members to become more stringent.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT, said: “Clearly Covid and Covid-related absence is still interrupting education for staff and students. We are hearing from members on a daily basis who are still experiencing a high level of disruption.”He said headteachers were “particularly concerned” about the rules relating to siblings and household contacts.“At the moment, if a child tests positive for Covid, their siblings can continue to attend school, even if they share a bedroom, for example. Our members say this is actively contributing to the spread of Covid in schools,” Mr Whiteman said.“School leaders want the Government to revisit its guidance, particularly when it comes to contact tracing and self-isolation. No one wants to see a child miss any time off school, but there is a real risk that the current policy is inadvertently leading to more children missing school in the long run.”School leaders reported that they are experiencing “a high level of disruption” with nearly half reporting that pupil attendance this term is lower than expected in a usual year.More than one in four say they have already exceeded Covid-19 case thresholds set by the Government, and on average respondents say they have had three members of staff absent due to Covid-19 this term.Current guidance says that if a certain threshold of Covid-19 cases is reached, schools should consider “taking extra action” and seek public health advice if they are concerned.More from NewsConservative Party conference latest: Get back to work in the normal way or you\u0026#39ll miss out, says Boris JohnsonBoris Johnson tells BBC’s Dan Walker: \u0026#39It should be Strictly Come Vaccinated\u0026#39At least 330,000 children suffered sex abuse at hands of French Catholic Church, inquiry findsAnti-Tory hysteria is getting out of handRussia beats Tom Cruise in race to shoot first movie in spaceChina is threatening the island of Taiwan with nuclear bombers - how worried should we be?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jacob rees mogg confronted man","story":":root Jacob Rees-Mogg confronted by man with cerebral palsy over shameful fit-for-work testsThe top Tory was challenged over cruel benefit tests as he walked a gauntlet of angry protesters shouting Tory scum outside the Conservative conference in Manchesterthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video jacob-rees-mogg-confronted-over-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:XNalqvTl,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Amid tense scenes outside the Tory conference in Manchester, Dominic Hutchins, , told the Leader of the Commons what he had to go through to prove he was eligible for welfare benefits. Police and demonstrators stood by during the three-minute showdown just outside the Midland Hotel and its ring-of-steel secure zone. Mr Rees-Mogg, who had walked a gauntlet of angry protesters chanting “Tory scum!” before stopping to speak to Mr Hutchins, told him: “I strongly advise you to speak to your MP.” Speaking later to the Mirror, Mr Hutchins, who lives near Stockport, Greater Manchester, said: “He heard me but it’s all lip service.  “A lot of people with disabilities can’t do this, their voices aren’t heard so I tried to go out to make the point. “If I don’t do it, the people like me who have cerebral palsy will never be heard.” Mr Hutchins, who receives a personal independence payment, said the fitness to work assessment left him feeling “downgraded”. “I have had cerebral palsy from birth. Two years ago I had to prove I have still got cerebral palsy,” he said. “I had an hour-long assessment telling them everything I can’t do - do you know how inhuman that is ” He claimed: “They are making it harder and harder - it’s shameful.” Mr Hutchins told how he lost his job because of Conservative cuts to youth services. “I have got a degree, I graduated from Huddersfield in ,” he said. “I’m a youth and community worker. Since the Tories got in power in  they have demolished youth services, which made me claim benefits. “I not only had to claim jobseeker’s allowance, I had to prove I am still disabled and I’ve not medically been cured.“People like Jacob Rees-Mogg - he will go back to his fancy house.They don’t care, it’s all lip service to shut people like me up. It’s awful.” The altercation came as Mr Rees-Mogg said he was proud to be Tory scum and recounted how activists has scrawled the word on the front of his house.  Asked by LBChe was racist  Misogynistic  Scum , he said:Well, do you know that the Duke of Wellington… referred to the British Army as the scum of the world, scum of the earth he said, and he said but look what we’ve made out of the scum… what find men we have created.And I think those of us who are proud to be Tory scum, look at what fine people we’ve been made by being Tories and being educated by this great party and following in the footsteps of Margaret Thatcher and Boris Johnson.So, I’m not too fussed. Askedhe was proud, he said: I don’t care. We did have somebody come and write ‘scum’ on our front door at home and my we said ‘this is outrageous and shocking. They should’ve put ‘Tory Scum’.I meanyou’re going to put it, you’ve got to put it right.

Ben Elliot used the eyebrow-raising phrase with activists in Manchester who grilled him on the candidate selection process. Questioned by one member at the Conservative Party Conference, Mr Elliot said: Is the point that you feel three is too little, or you feel that the local association doesnapost, you know, CCHQ [Conservative Campaign Headquarters] is meant to have rooted out the nutters, as I think youaposre saying  Youaposre saying you want a longer list and it might include some nutters  The party member replied: You take out the mad, the bad and the sad - but you let us choose, youaposre there to represent us. Mr Elliot joked back: Weaposll have no politicians left.  Tory chiefs force would-be candidates through a five-hour, £ whittling process called a aposParliamentary Assessment Boardapos. Those who want to sit in Parliament are subjected to psychometric tests looking at their aposcore beliefsapos, intellect, leadership and communication skills before they can be eligible for selection by a local party. But ConservativeHome reported party chiefs are planning to invite all those on the approved list for reassessment under a new procedure. The succession of elections in ,  and  - and Boris Johnsonaposs -seat majority - allowed far more hopefuls to become MPs than many thought.

As well as being co-chairman of the Tories, the -year-old is the Duchess of Cornwall’s nephew and a director of Quintessentially - a “luxury lestyle management service” for the super-rich. Quintessentially subscriber and Tory donor Mohamed Amersi claimed in July that Mr Elliot arranged for him to meet Prince Charles - after years of subscription payments. Mr Amersi claimed at the time: “I call it access capitalism… You get access, you get invitations, you get privileged relationshipsyou are part of the set-up, and where you are financially making a contribution to be a part of that set up. The Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists found Mr Elliot did not need to register as a lobbyist, but it advised him “to be cautious about the possibility of engaging in consultant lobbying activityby not making a clear enough distinction between his role as a director of Quintessentially and his other activities connected to government.” A spokesperson on behalf of Mr Elliot said at the time: “The registrar has made clear that Quintessentially does not lobby Government and therefore does not need to register as a lobbyist.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyBoris JohnsonRoyal FamilyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The super-rich Chancellor’s stubborn move will plunge millions more into poverty. One UC claimant said: “I don’t know how I’ll manage.” Meanwhile out of touch Mr Sunak, left, was stumped at the cost of a can of beans.With millions already in poverty, he had the opportunity to show the Tories are serious about levelling up by axing the £ Universal Credit cut.But the Chancellor, who is married to a billionaire’s daughter, condemned many more to a le of misery after he refused to scrap the vital benefit which helps poor ­families stay afloat amid the cost-of-living crisis.  And he sparked fury by dismissing the genuine fears of those who will be hit hardest by the cut by declaring: “Is the answer to their hopes and dreams just to increase their benefits ” Many people claiming UC are in work but their wages are so dire they need the extra £ just to survive. The cruel blow comes on top of a National Insurance hike and after more than a decade of austerity. In an example of how out of touch Mr Sunak is with the ­ordinary people he is battering, he could not say when quizzed how much a tin of beans costs.The Chancellor, who has plans for a swimming pool, gym and tennis court at his £.million Yorkshire manor, rejected pleas by Labour, unions, landlords, charities and Tory MPs to keep the payment. Labour’s Angela Eagle said: “You can’t expect somebody who has got planning permission to build an indoor swimming pool in his constituency home to ­understand the terrible choice that some working ­families have to take between heating their home and feeding their children. “The £ cut to UC will plunge six million people further into poverty and take huge amounts of money out of the economy. It’s still not too late to cancel the cut.” Mr Sunak was asked by LBC radio host Nick Ferrari what was the price of a tin of Heinz beans. He replied: “I don’t know … -ish p maybe ” It costs p. When told, Mr Sunak did not stop digging: “  OK. I get the smaller packet ones though...”  One community worker even put a shopping list together to show him how much food families would lose after the £ cut. Rayna Downey, from Northern Ireland’s Women’s Centre, Derry, said the extra cash helps households eat. She added: “I wanted to see what you could realistically provide for your family. And it turns out you can do pretty well with four or five dinners, your breakfast and lunch. It’s the basics, yes, but it goes to show that £ can go a long way. “I’ve made five cracking dinners, everyone’s had lunch and cereal for breakfast, tea, coffee or whatever. “Now that’s going, and even more people are going to end up struggling.” Childminder Caroline Rice is one of around % of UC claimants who are working, but need it to top up low pay.  The -year-old, from Co. Fermanagh, said: “I don’t know how I will manage with the £ a week taken away. That’s nearly £ every payment term. We’ve cut all our outgoings as much as we can and I’ve got to the point where we can’t cut any more. We barely get by every month. “I need my car for work. I can’t stop paying my rent or stop eating. We’ve already cut our TV licence. The debts that I already have are never going to be paid and it’s just going to grow.” But Mr Sunak’s patronising message to people such as Caroline in his speech to Tory conference was to tell them stand on their own two feet. He said: “Is the answer to tell a young family, the economic system is rigged against you and the only way you stand a chance is to lean ever more on the state ”  The former Goldman Sachs banker, who is thought to be the richest MP, also claimed “we should all be grateful” to the Tories for a decade of “sound management” of the economy. But he ignored the devastating effects of austerity, which has plunged millions of Britons into poverty and ­crippled public services such as schools and hospitals. The Chancellor, who went to a top boarding school and Oxford University, was once snapped with a £ heated bluetooth coffee mug as Britain braced itself for a wave of Covid job losses. But he told activists that he would only consider cutting taxes once the public finances are on a “sustainable footing” following the pandemic. He said: “Our recovery comes with a cost.” Mr Sunak refused to rule out more tax rises after the hike in National Insurance that comes in next April. That means higher bills for council tax, which has soared by above ­inflation for years, to pay for social care. Mr Sunak acknowledged that tax rises are “unpopular, some will even say un-Conservative”.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Angela EagleConservative PartyNational Insurance Company Ltd.Oxford UniversityThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.HospitalsTaxCouncil taxJob lossesPublic servicesSwimming poolsThe economyPoliticsBillionairesUniversal Credit\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Wealthy Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak’s dismissal of the working and non-working poor he is about to push below the breadline is ugly politics. Le’s been good to him so it turns the stomach that a Conservative Cabinet Minister aiming to succeed Boris Johnson displays so little sympathy for the six million he’s snatching £ a week Universal Credit from. Sunak’s patronising rhetoric – “Is the answer to their hopes and dreams just to increase their benefits ” – isn’t the right question to ask millions of working poor who graft for low wages and deserve help. With the Chancellor opposed to a genuine living wage, grinding down workers reveals the grim truth behind the Conservatives’  levelling up propaganda. Playing the fuel Military drivers and personnel are finally in the cabs of petrol tankers, but a responsible Government would have ordered their deployment earlier. With the fuel crisis still gripping parts of the country, particularly London and South East England, the slow response of Boris Johnson again shows his incompetence.  Playing the joker, liking to jest and exude fake optimism, isn’t real leadership. It is a ersion, a distraction, a smokescreen from a trivial inidual betraying his high office. The man in No without a plan after the Brexit foul-up he delivered owes an apology to the millions he deceived and let down.

Boris Johnson ’s party descended on Manchester this week for their annual conference.But the city’s metro mayor, Andy Burnham, expressed anger at the revelation, which contradicts the Government’s official reasons for blocking a probe. Pitmen have spent three decades demanding an inquiry into cops’ actions at the infamous clash at the height of the Miners’ Strike. Violence flared between officers and pickets at the South Yorkshire coking plant on June , . Mounted police launched horseback charges and baton-wielding “snatch squads” as , officers tried to prevent striking colliers blocking deliveries to the plant. South Yorkshire Police received heavy criticism over its conduct. A total of  miners were charged with rioting. But none was successfully prosecuted after the first cases collapsed through unreliable evidence. Former miners and their families demanded a Hillsborough-style probe to look at how South Yorkshire Police - the same force involved at Hillsborough - behaved before, during and after the  Battle. In , Amber Rudd, then Home Secretary, rejected a formal inquiry, saying there was not a sufficient basis for a review. But a book by the we of a Tory MP claims the real reason Ms Rudd scrapped the probe was because it would slur the memory of Thatcher and upset party members.Sasha Swire, the we of Tory MP Hugo Swire, says Ms Rudd made the admission during a kitchen supper on September ,  - shortly after Ms Rudd was promoted to Home Secretary by Theresa May. She wrote: She tells me she loves all the James Bond stuff, the MI and MI briefings. But Amberaposs immediate concern is the number of potential inquiries that need decisions on whether they go ahead. Most of them she inherited from her predecessor, who kicked them into the long grass. Orgreave would slur the memory of Thatcher and the party wonapost like it. The revelation was spotted by Mr Burnham, who said: Itaposs kind of an interesting and quite revealing read because it does reveal how this country is run, and how the other half who are running the country are living. He added: We suspected it at the time. In the House of Commons she said we wouldnapost have an inquiry into Orgreave because nobody died. Actually, behind closed doors it was about aposMargaretaposs legacy being tarnishedapos, and thataposs why everybody needs to continue to support the Orgreave Truth and Justice campaign, because that will tell you how this country is run. A spokesperson for the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign said: “We believe that Amber Rudd refused an Orgreave Inquiry because she was pressured by the establishment and heavily influenced by Tory ministers from the Thatcher era who would rather cover up the past than reveal and admit the wrongdoings of the past. The Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign had corresponded and met with Rudd before she denied an Orgreave Inquiry. “At that meeting she implied there would be some type of inquiry but had not decided what form that inquiry would take. The group continues to campaign for a public inquiry.

Police were called to the Midland Hotel bar on Sunday night, after Clementine Cowton, the director of external affairs at Octopus Energy Group, said she was “violently assaulted in the conference zone by a man” who was very intoxicated. She said the man had invaded her space. “I was sitting down and he plonked himself down on the chair that had been vacated by a friend of mine and I asked him to leave and he refused to,” she said. “He was very intoxicated and I felt a bit unsafe around him, so I asked him several times politely to leave.” When he refused, Ms Cowton said she had taken his phone and dropped it on the floor to create space between them. After he picked it up, she said the man had tried to punch her but only managed to get as far as smashing a glass out of my hand. She said he had been immediately set upon by lots of people who stopped him from doing anything.” Around  minutes after the incident, she said, police came over and she reported it to them.  On Monday morning, a source told the Mirror: There was a bunch of young Tories in the Midlands bar last night and things got a bit heated. They added: It was really shocking. The police were called. But Greater Manchester Police initially said they were not aware of police being called to an incident at the hotel. They later issued a statement, which read: Police responded to an incident at the Midland hotel at around :am this morningto reports of an assault on a -year-old woman. Officers arrived quickly, there were no reports of any injures, and no arrests were made, however a man has been identied, had his accreditation removed for the remainder of the Conservative Party Conference.

Speaking at a fringe event at the conference, according to the Times, Ms Cowton said: Women are often unsafe in places where other people feel safe, and it’s really important that we start to take that much more seriously as a society and, starting with the police. A Tory spokesperson confirmed the man involved was a party member and has now been suspended. They said: “This behaviour is completely unacceptable and the Party has revoked the pass of the inidual concerned and is working with the police.” Comment MORE ON Jacob Rees-MoggBoris JohnsonConservative PartyOctopus EnergyGreater Manchester PolicePoliticsCerebral palsy\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This policy enabled us to move quickly and help the nation. Hopefully, this new venture will continue that trend.”  The announcement comes in the week after NHS data showed that far fewer face-to-face appointment are taking place compared to before the pandemic. Just % of patients saw a doctor in the flesh in August - the first full month following the ending of restrictions. That compares with % in January and over % before the pandemic.The coronavirus testing programme and the increased vulnerability of elderly patients, coupled with a % fall in GP numbers over the past five years partially explains the fall in numbers. Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, has said that over the phone and online consultations will remain a central part of the countryaposs healthcare system post-pandemic.“There’s a role for remote consultations when it comes to health care, he said at the Conservative Party conference. “I suspect, in fact I know, from speaking to the clinicians that a lot of that will continue.” Remote treatment and consultations carried out by those not trained as doctors may impact how many people with subtle symptoms arenapost properly diagnosed and treated. At the moment two-thirds of people with red-flag symptoms of cancer are not being given urgent referrals.

Jo McMeechan, , lives in Bristol with her husband Alex, , and their two sons Rory, , and Arthur, . During the pandemic Jo, who is a paediatric physiotherapist, has seen both her children have mental health problems.A week before lockdown was announced, Jo and Alex decided to shield their household, as Rory had just recovered from sepsis and had severe asthma, making him extremely vulnerable to coronavirus.However, this “signicantly impacted” Rory’s mental health. “He really struggled, especially with the social isolation,” said Jo.   “He missed his friends and had limited opportunities to safely get outdoors as the advice for him was to shield for  weeks. Rory struggled to sleep and had no motivation for anything, and he also became very tearful and distressed most days. He couldn’t understand why he wasn’t allowed to socialise with his friends.” Jo said that when schools reopened for the children of key workers, she made the decision to send Rory back, as he just wasn’t coping with the social isolation. “My husband and I were seriously concerned about the effect this would have on him in the long-term,” she said. “We thought the risk of Covid was less than the damage to his mental health, so we took a key worker place at his school for him and the dference that we saw in him as the social isolation lted and his education became more stable was incredible. However, I still don’t feel he is fully back to how he was before the pandemic.”  Jo and Alex’s younger son Arthur however struggled with coming out of lockdown. Arthur is Autistic and has ADHD, as well as Sensory Processing Disorder which means he has problems with sitting still, focusing, and regulating his emotions. “On the flipside, Arthur really well during the pandemic, but going back to socialising has been a real challenge as his anxiety is through the roof,” said Jo. “He’s had to go back to school on a reduced timetable of  minutes a day at most. We have a lot of dficulties taking Arthur out without it causing him distress. He’s run out of school gates towards traffic to avoid crowds or hidden in bushes to avoid people. “It’s been very challenging, especially now things have fully opened up.  He wants to do things but gets too overwhelmed. Recently we went to our local harvest fair and he got out on the green and saw the crowds of people and sat down hugging his knees and refused to move. “Before the pandemic, this was never a signicant issue for Arthur. He would have thrived in those situations before.” Jo said her and Alex were left managing their children’s mental health by themselves. “We talked to their school about getting help from the nursing team there, but we were told access to resources was zilch and there was pretty much nothing available for us,” said Jo. “From my experience as a health professional, a lot of our community teams were redistributed to Covid or were having to isolate meaning there were not enough people working in a system that was already overstretched, so although we discussed access to help for the boys it seemed asit was going to be a futile quest for a referral. It has been so hard for my family.” Rory and Arthur are two of several children the Mirror has reported on to expose the impact of the pandemic on their mental health.The Daily Mirror is launching our new campaign HeadStrong: Better Mental Health For All.

Just two years ago the lad would spend almost every evening playing football with his friends. But he has become so riddled with anxiety that he is harming himself. He has been biting his cheek so hard it has an inch-wide hole. It will take a long time to heal, and – as young person’s therapist Sally Baker has learned – so too will the mental health of the huge number of children who are struggling because of the pandemic. She says: “Before, he was a happy child with no mental health dficulties. “But everything he enjoyed, such as being able to play with his friends or go to football, was taken away and he didn’t really understand why, so it was ashe was in mourning. His mum came to see me because he spends hours in the foetal position or rocking back and forth.”  Sadly, there are many more like him. He is one of an estimated . million children who charity The Centre for Mental Health believes will need help for things such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder directly because of the pandemic. This number is three times higher than the current capacity of the UK’s mental health services. New figures given to the Mirror by charity Mind suggest these children’s services will need £.billion to cope. This would fund a nationwide rollout of early access walk-in hubs for under-s, extra staff and more treatment programmes. The Government is pledging £.bn a year by   to help two million people across all age groups. It is clear that these provisions are likely to fall far short of what is needed. Another worry is that roughly % of the mental health budget has usually gone to children’s services. “Our children are the canaries in the mine,” says senior therapist Sally who is based in London.  “If the Government think the funding’s enough, they need to go back to maths class.” She believes the Tories failed to focus on the psychological effect of closing schools and isolating children. She adds: “There is a hidden epidemic of hurt and pain out there. “If the problems aren’t tackled, this could lead to more self-harm and eating disorders – things I’ve seen a massive increase of in my practice over the past year. “If it’s not tackled now there could be repercussions for generations to come.”The Daily Mirror is launching our new campaign HeadStrong: Better Mental Health For All.

The figures already speak for themselves. Emergency referrals to crisis care teams for under-s were % higher in March  compared with the previous year. While urgent referrals rose by % to also reach a record high. An investigation by Labour revealed more than a third of children were left in limbo as they were not deemed ill enough or suicidal enough for help from child and adolescent mental health services, despite being referred by a GP. Around , out of , cases were closed before treatment. It can leave children at risk of developing further problems or having crises such as a nervous breakdown, self-harming and suicidal thoughts. Waiting lists are so long that private child psychiatrists have recorded a threefold rise in self-funding patients during the pandemic. Going private is an option low-income parents, whose kids are most at risk of developing mental health problems, cannot afford. Child psychotherapist Rachel Melville-Thomas says: “Before the pandemic, children’s mental health provision was already in a dire state due to cuts. Now we have this additional problem of Covid, and we are having to deal with it in an underfunded service which is forced to only deal with people at high levels of risk, such as those who are very suicidal.” The spokeswoman for the Association of Child Psychotherapists adds: “It means those with problems such as depression, anxiety or the [emergence] of an eating disorder are being turned away. We need more funding and we need it now.” When contacted, the Department of Health pointed to the £.bn it is putting into mental health care across the board as well as a £m injection into children’s mental health. It added it is also investing a stopgap of £m in children’s mental health, which the department said will help , youngsters.

Mr Withers says the family are beside themselves and just want Pippa back home with their other dogs. He thinks there were around four people in the car - possibly two men and two women - and they were shouting and messing about on the farm before disappearing with the black and tan coloured dog.  By the time he realised what had happened and gave chase, they were long gone and the family would like to hear from anyone with information. Pippa was also stolen a year ago but was ed two days later after her theft went viral. Dad-of-two Ross is offering a large cash reward for information or her safeand said he canapost imagine how Pippa must be feeling. Iaposm just imagining how she is feeling right now. If she is shut in some cage wondering where I am, he said. I was looking at her seconds before while they were roaming around and then suddenly she wasnapost there.  My we was calling and I was whistling and she would usually come straight back from a mile away. There is no chance that she has run off or anything. I would put my childrenaposs lives on those people having taken Pippa. He said he watched the people the entire time but couldnapost make out what they were doing. Iaposm usually terrible for flying out there and confronting them. I did think, aposwhat are they doing apos And I could hear our other dog beneath me going berserk but Pippa had run straight over to them to see what they are doing, sheaposs so friendly. He continued: As soon as I heard my we shouting for Pippa I heard the penny drop, he said. I jumped in the car and went after them but there were so many cars and they were long gone. The family thinks that the vehicle may have been a BMW but it is not clear from the CCTV footage. Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed it is investigating a report that a dog was stolen. It said: We are investigating a report that a dog was stolen from a rural address in the Probus area at around pm on Sunday  October. The dog is described as a small, female, short-haired Jack Russell who is black and tan in colour.

Among those who attended the ceremony were Prince William, the Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Harry aunts and Princess Dianaaposs sisters, Lady Jane Fellowes, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Meghanaposs mum Doria.At the time of the christening, the names of Archieaposs godparents were not announced and kept private by Harry and Meghan. And according to the updated version of his unauthorised biography, Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, Andrew Morton says this left Prince William perplexed. He writes: The decision to keep the names of the godparents secret was another issue, one of many, that perplexed William. He, like others inside the family, felt that those chosen to guide and counsel a future royal prince, seventh in line to the throne, should be identied. Harry and Meghan thought otherwise. They explained that the godparents were genuine friends, not celebrities or public figures, and had joined with the royal couple in preferring privacy.

Click here to sign up .Months after the christening, Harry and Meghan decided to quit as senior royals and left the UK to live in Calornia. They have since welcomed a second child, a daughter called Lilibet, who was born in the U.S and has yet to be brought to the UK for a visit. Reports have suggested that the couple were keen to have the three-month-old christened in Britain like her older brother Archie. He was younger than what Lilibet is now when he was baptised and it has also been claimed that a trip to the UK would also allow the Queen to meet her th great-grandchild for the first time. However, on a recent edition of True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat, the assembled royal experts were askedthey could see Harry and Meghan ing to the UK soon for a christening.But Hello!aposs royal editor Emily Nash said: I think that is fairly unlikely. Royal historian Dr Andrew Lownie agreed as did the Sunday Times royal editor Roya Nikkhah.Meanwhile, another royal expert previously said it is likely the infant will be christened in the US.  Author Richard Fitzwilliams told the Express : Harry and Meghan’s relations with the British press went badly downhill when Archie was christened in private and the names of the godparents were not released.The Sussexes were emphatic that they intended to do things their own way and so it has proved. It must be likely that she will be christened in Calornia though there are rumours of a possible christening at Windsor.

The clip quickly went viral online, with several people commenting and sharing it. A viewer wrote: This video is a perfect example of why supermarkets need to stop selling pastry out in the open like this. Itaposs not just the rats itaposs the flies too. Do you have any similar footage from a supermarket  Email webnews@mirror  Another said: I can’t believe what my eyes are seeing. One more added: I mean, they’re everywhere… but this is particularly gross… Another shopper said they would never buy loose bakery items again. Mr Mitson posted another video today showing a sign outside the supermarket telling customers the shop is closed. The sign reads: This store is closed at the moment. Sorry for the inconvenience. A Sainsburyaposs spokesperson said: We are immediately investigating with the store.In , a mum-of-two told of her horror after she found a live rat trapped inside a sealed packet of plums she had bought from Aldi.Salma Riaz, , and her husband, Kamran, bought the punnet of fruit but failed to spot the rodent curled up in the plastic container, covered with netting. In July , a Tesco customer filmed a large rat scurrying around a supermarket. Danielle Westbrook, , dumped her basket and ran out of the shop after spotting the rodent. The gran-of-three told The Mirror: I let out an almighty scream. It’s appalling and disgusting. Now I feel angry. I’m never ever shopping in there again. It’s made me feel sick to my stomach that I have ever eaten food bought from this store.

With last winter disrupted by lockdown, and young people missing so much school, college, time with friends and seeing grandparents, getting the vaccine will help make sure this year is a whole lot better. Not only does the vaccine protect young people against serious illness – almost  per cent of Covid patients admitted to hospital are unvaccinated – it also means they’re less likely to spread the virus to elderly family members. No more FOMO We’ve come a long way with the vaccination programme since those dark days of last winter. The Covid- vaccine has already saved more than , lives and prevented  million infections.Jabs are now being rolled out for the - age group, and more than  per cent of --year-olds have already had theirs. And getting the jab couldn’t be easier: schools and colleges are offering it through their immunisation programmes, while older teenagers can make an appointment through the online booking service at nhs.uk covidvaccination.If you’re a parent orof a --year-old, schools will ask for your consent before they receive the vaccine, and you can help --year-olds book their dose online. Then it’s one less thing for you to worry about – and they won’t need to worry about missing out on all those good times with family and friends.Fashion and lestyle influencer Arabella Daho , , is keen to book her vaccine appointment. “I think the vaccine is a great thing for everyone to have – it’s helping to keep us safe, she says. We have loads of events coming up such as Halloween and Christmas, and we don’t want to miss them. “On my digital s I’ve interviewed a few of the doctors who worked on the vaccine, talking about how safe it is, and why it’s important for everyone to get it. It was good to talk to them – I learned a lot, soanyone wants to see those videos or do research to help them feel better about getting the vaccine, I think they should. “Young people think they’re immune to everything, but we can actually be spreading Covid, especially to older people, who are more vulnerable. So getting jabbed helps communities and families get back to normal.” ‘All my kids have had their vaccines’ We asked GP and mum-of-three Dr Dawn Harper about what the vaccine means for young people… How do you feel about your kids being offered the vaccine  All my kids are in their s and they’ve all had their vaccines. I was very keen for them to get vaccinated as soon as they were eligible. If I had a -to--year-old I’d be putting them forward for the vaccine. We’ve been able to draw on global data several countries have already been offering the vaccine to --year-olds, and we have a lot of evidence to show that it’s safe for that age group. And while young people are less likely to become seriously ill with Covid, I am in total agreement with the chief medical officers concerning the impact on their mental health and their education, and also the possibility of long Covid. And, of course, we are only enjoying the relative freedoms we have today in the UK because of the vaccine programme. Without it, we’d still be in a lockdown. We need the vaccine to protect ourselves from Covid and long Covid, and also to protect our loved ones and our community. So I’m very keen for young people to come forward and have the vaccine. Did you have to persuade your children to have the jab  They were up for it. For me, lockdown was easier: I’m  and don’t mind walking my dog on my own, but I think young people really struggled missing out on their social lives.  What are the side effects of the vaccine in young people  The main one is perhaps a bit of soreness in the arm. I had a sore arm after my first vaccine but nothing at all after my second. It’s incredibly safe. I’m still amazed at how the researchers worked to get this to market as quickly as they did, running trials simultaneously without cutting safety corners. Long Covid is a worry for many parents. Will the vaccine protect young people against it  I have patients with long Covid. It is a horrible condition and there is evidence that the vaccine protects against this. We’re still on a very steep learning curve with long Covid. It’s unpredictable. We have fit young people who have been knocked sideways by it. The things that people talk to me about is the fatigue, the brain fog – I’ve got patients who are very intelligent academics who just can’tat work. Is the vaccine suitable for vegans and people with food allergies  It’s totally vegan-friendly and not a problem for those with allergies. What about those who are scared of needles  For the -to- age group, school nurses are well experienced in managing this. If you’re nervous you can ask to lie down. You can also buy over-the-counter cream to rub into your arm  minutes beforehand. I don’t even think I felt my second vaccine going in it’s such a tiny needle. For a moment of a sharp scratch, to know that you’re protected against Covid it’s well worth the trade-off. Has the vaccine been rigorously tested on the younger age group  Yes, I feel very confident about the science behind it. There’s been a lot of debate on risk vs benefit in dferent age groups. Young people are less likely to get seriously ill, but we need to weigh that against missed education, protection from long Covid and letting kids get out and about again so that we can help them with any mental health issues. If you come from a middle-class background where you’ve all got your own computers, home schooling was much easier thanyou’re all trying to share one screen, so it’s really important that we try to even out those dferences and get people back into the classroom.Last winter’s lockdown was so tough on young people’s mental health. Does the vaccine mean that things will be better this year  That wouldbe my hope. We’ll see messages coming out about meeting outside and ventilation I still wear a mask in the supermarket we have hand sanitiser in our bags and our cars, and I think that makes sense. But expanding the vaccine programme to include these younger people will mean that hopefully they can start to get back to some kind of normality. AGED  OR  If you have a teenager who hasn’t booked their vaccine yet, you can give them a helping hand so that they don’t get left behind – and protect the rest of the family from serious illness. Jabs can now be booked online at nhs.uk covidvaccination, or you can ask your GP or go to your nearest walk-in centre. PARENT OR CARER OF A --YEAR-OLD Offering young people the vaccine is essential to prevent them missing school and help make sure they can carry on doing the things they love with their friends and family. Everyone in this age group will be offered a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine through their school’s immunisation programme, which already administers the HPV and MMR vaccines. Parents and s will be asked for their consent via a form – andyou have any questions you can discuss them with the School Age Immunisation Service."},{"url":null,"title":"leicester gas leak two people","story":":root Leicester gas leak: Two people found dead in house with nearby homes evacuatedThe roads in the area affected in Leicester were closed and homes nearby were evacuated following reports of the gas leak, with a police cordon still in place as of Monday evening.A police cordon remained in place around the area on Monday evening Image: Chris Gordon Leicestershire LiveByCorey Bedford:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsTwo people have been found dead at a Leicester home following reports of a gas leak, while nearby properties are being evacuated.

The -year-old went to a dermatologist in Mannheim, Germany, due to the red patches that had developed on the back of his hands and arms and he later found the worrying diagnosis that it was leukaemia cutis. Tests done at the hospital showed that he had a high white-cell count along with a low number of platelets, it is reported.The case was published in the New England Medical Journal where it said that a diagnosis of leukaemia cutis was made.While extremely rare, the condition means that the leukaemia cells are in the skin tissue. It is found to happen in around three percent of leukaemia cases where the rash has been found on skin including the arms, back or face.  Other leukaemia symptoms include fever, tiredness and susceptibility to infections. But in the case of the -year-old in Germany, he only had the rash on his hands and elbow. The New England Medical Journal stated: A diagnosis of leukemia cutis was made, and the patient was urgently referred to the oncology clinic. The patient received a diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and underwent stem-cell transplantation. Two weeks after the transplantation, the patient’s skin changes had resolved, and the cancer has been in remission since. Leukaemia Care UK said that usually patients who have the cancer and find rashes do not have this particular condition. It stated: “Leukaemia cutis is very rare, occurring in only about three percent of total cases of leukaemia. With this in mind, it is unsurprising that most lesions seen in leukaemia patients are not leukaemia cutis. “In fact, most lesionsseen in leukaemia patients are caused by other complications of leukaemia.” It continued: “In the rare occasion that leukaemia cutis occurs, the patient will normally have already been diagnosed with leukaemia. However, in seven percent of cases of leukaemia cutis, the skin lesion is the very first symptom of a blood cancer.

The emails included one mistake-riddled message which read: Take your response and shove it up your f**king a**hole. Another stated: Frankly I think you should get some work done rather than talk about language you f**king hypocrites. Knott, whoaposs own MP is Emily Thornberry, said he suffers from PTSD after the death of his quadriplegic partner Nicholas Walker because they saw demons coming out of the walls of their home. He told the court the flat had severe problems with noise during the night that left him deprived of sleep for six months.

I was on the streets at , I was HIV positive at , my emails are not the same as someone who went to Oxford or Hard.  Six months sleep deprivation, we were seeing demons come out of the walls.

He told the court his white blood cell count fell below  because of the sleep deprivation and suffered pneumonia due to his AIDS. Knott, of Dalston, denied but was convicted of two counts of harassment without violence. Sabrina Felix, for Knott, said: The defendant was previously illiterate. He has now begun, and continues to receive, literacy lessons in reading and writing so when he was sending those emails they were one liners, most of them, because he dictated the emails rather than typing them. So he used the emails more like a text service, sending one line at a time. Knott was offered a caution when he was first arrested, but refused. Knott received an eight week community order, meaning he will be on a tagged curfew between the hours of pm and am. He was ordered to pay £ in court costs at a rate of £ every two weeks.

Meghan was a working royal for a short time after her wedding to Prince Harry in May , but the couple decided to quit the UK and move to America in early .Now in an updated version of Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, an unauthorised biography by Andrew Morton, it is claimed Meghan found it hard to bond with some royals. He writes: It was clear that Meghan had ruffled feathers in the family and that they felt she and Harry were very dficult to deal with. For her part, Meghan found some of its members – not the Queen or Prince Philip – unfriendly and jealous.At a personal level, then, their departure from Britain was quietly welcomed by some in the Windsor family and their courtiers, but on an institutional level it was a heavy blow. The book also claims that Meghan found le inside the royal family as institution slow, repetitive and, quite frankly, unimaginative.

Click here to sign up .Morton adds: Her own endeavours, particularly the Grenfell cookbook and the capsule collection she had overseen for Smart Works, were the type of projects she wanted to work on – and they could take place outside the royal world.Since leaving the royal family, Meghan has given a bombshell interview to Oprah Winfrey, where she said there was a lack of support within the institution and she felt isolated as she battled mental health issues. She also claimed that one of the royals had made comments about how dark son Archieaposs skin would be before he was born.Speaking earlier this year, on the Channel  programme Meghan at : The Climb To Power, royal author Tom Quinn said Meghan wanted to shake up the royal family. He said: I think the problem for Meghan was that she was angry, she was upset. “I think that she thought when she entered the Royal Family she could shake them up and they would love it, she would do things Meghan’s way. He continued: When that didn’t happen and she came up against what she saw as the forces of reaction it made her so upset that, that interview [with Oprah Winfrey] was her way I think the only way for her to get her revenge and put the case as she saw it. But I think later on she will think I shouldn’t have burnt my bridges to that extent.

Teacher Louise Lavery, , from Blackpool, Lancashire, couldnapost muster more than a strangled squeak when she woke up on the day of her sonaposs graduation. Louiseaposs speech issues first cropped up seven years ago while working as a religion and philosophy teacher. The busy mum thought she had just been speaking too much until her voice started to break more often. She eventually went to a consultant who told her to look after her voice and to take up speech therapy. In July , Louise was travelling to her sonaposs graduation when her attempts to speak caused spasms in her larynx. Every time I attempted to speak my larynx would go into spasms and the noise I made was either nonexistent or a strained, strangled squeak, Louise said. It was very distressing and the more I attempted to push it out the worse it would become. I hoped and prayed that my voice would , but it didn’t. Louise saw a voice specialist who diagnosed her with laryngeal dystonia, a chronic voice disorder caused by spasms of the muscles of the voice box. She took time off work on sick leave, hoping she would be able toafter having some treatment. She said: Le became dficult, my job almost impossible to carry out. I could manage the basics but anything more is too much of a struggle. I do have some good days and moments where my voice will be audible, although the spasms are ever-present. The condition is incredibly isolating as the effort required to speak, often overrides the need, so I remain silent. One of the hardest things for Louise was not being able to speak to her five children - Lucy , Luke , Jack , Leah,  and Leo, .  She said: It was dficult when I lost my voice as all of our children were at quite pivotal points in their lives, so either going to university, leaving university, taking exams, etc. I just wasn’t able to speak with them, or advise them, or help them in the way that I wished to. When your children are struggling, or making important decisions you just want to be able to encourage them, or just chat. She started undergoing treatment, which involved injecting botox into a thin muscle in her neck. However, the treatments are risky asthe positioning is not precise, it can cause her airways to become blocked. On two separate occasions, Louiseaposs airway has closed and she has been taken to hospital unable to breathe. With the risks involved, Louise realised that botox injections were no longer an option and she decided to look at other forms of treatment. Louise - who had to give up her job due to the condition - found a study in the US involving trial medication. She had to raise £, to travel to the states for the Hard University trial - a target she hit in just over a month with the help of friends, family and former students.  The money allowed her to travel to Canada two weeks ago and she is due to start the trial soon. She said: What really humbled me were not only the amount of family, friends and my parish church community who helped us but also many of my former students heard about the story. They shared messages about how I’d help them achieve their dreams and the impact I’d had on their education, it was truly overwhelming. It was largely down to their efforts that the journey has become possible. These students are now adults and to think that they still appreciate the work I did then is truly astonishing.  She added: Losing your voice doesn’t sound that bad. However, the loss that accompanies this is truly devastating, the loss of job, the loss of self, the loss of being able to simply chat with friends and family. Your voice plays a huge part in who we are and I don’t think people realise this, until it’s gone.

In the hours that followed I found myself angry both for her and her family. She’d tripped in her garden, on the concrete outside her back door, and lay there in agony. We weren’t to know at the time but she’d broken her hip. We wanted to move her but couldn’t. The pain was so excruciating she couldn’t even extend her legs. Her husband dialled  and – after rejecting advice to instead call a doctor – was told it would take FOUR HOURS for an ambulance to arrive. He set out the urgency of the situation. She was lying on the cold concrete, in distress, unable to move. What had he been paying his National Insurance contributions for   I called up myself and I perhaps need to apologise to the poor call handler who bore the brunt of my exasperation over that shocking wait time. It wasn’t the handler’s fault. The London Ambulance Service are very obviously facing a thankless task. So no, it wasn’t my finest hour but you’d have been the same had you been in my position. Some kind-hearted builders working next door offered their services, turning up with a long piece of wooden board to lt her on to. She just couldn’t do it. Even the slightest movement left her crying out in pain. Appalled at the wait time themselves, the builders also dialled , to no avail. Still we waited. I ran into the nearbyGP surgery. A doctor came but was equally powerless beyond urging us not to move her. Her husband wrapped her in blankets. My we got her somehow to sip a cup of tea. Darkness set in. The temperature continued to fall. Again, imagine this being your neighbour, your mum, your dad or grandparent – or even you. The ambulance finally arrived at .pm. Again, I don’t blame them. This is the busiest the service has been in its history. On a typical day they receive around , calls. Right now it’s more than ,. “We apologise for the delay in reaching this patient and any distress that this might have caused,” said their statement later. “We aim to reach patients as quickly as we can and give all callers clear advice about ringing  againthe condition of the patient changes.” This government will sink champagne at their party conference this week and pat themselves on the back, insisting they ARE pumping money into the NHS. Ordinary people across the country, however, are experiencing similar waits as my neighbour with that “cash” not translating into easily accessible services. Health Secretary Sajid Javid is instead trying to steer us away from all that by targeting Premier League footballers yet to have the jab. What a surprise. My neighbour will have had surgery on her broken hip by the time you read this. God willing she is OK. She is a tough, wonderful woman who endured what millions of people are suffering right now. But what she went through is shameful.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Darren LewisPrince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A lot of people don’t necessarily see the work that we do here, but it’s predominantly to maintain firefighters’ competence.”  The training at Chelveston is tactical and will see whole time and on-call firefighters visit twice a year to take part in training programmes run by a team of eight instructors and supported by two training support technicians. The practical courses include search and rescue, where fire fighters are forced to navigate in dark conditions, extinguish fires, identy casualties and exit safely. And there’s compartment fire behaviour training – the highest risk exercise that exposes them to very high temperatures so they can learn gas cooling techniques. Other skills taught are in tactical ventilation and using fans to remove hot fire gases. New recruits undergo an intense three-week Breathing Apparatuscourse, which is run four times a year. This course is one of the toughest, both physically and mentally, and takes them all the way through to being confident to wear the BA gear, understand the risks with flashover and backdraughts, and how to cope in tough conditions. The rigs at Chelveston act as an introduction before they head off to join their new stations and revisit every year to maintain their skills. Before being used by Northants Fire, Chelveston was a Royal Air Force and United States Air Force base used in-case of emergency during WWII and the Cold War. “People come from across the country to join Northamptonshire Fire  Rescue Service,” said Watch Manager Instructor Chris Westfield. Chris himself transferred from London Fire Brigade in , where he dealt with large-scale incidents including Grenfell Tower. He added: “We recently had some whole time transferees and they did things such as RTC familiarisation and flashover training. Dferent services use dferent breathing apparatus, so they have gone through training with our BAs now and they have also done ultra-high-pressure training. “We make sure that we treat on-call the same as whole time when they visit us – they are firefighters and they should have the same training and safety. “Ultimately for whoever comes in we try to create, as best as we can, work related scenarios. The facilities we have here at Chelveston are far greater and advanced than a lot of other services, even down to the training rigs here. “You speak to a lot of people nationally and they either have rigs that are very limited, or no training at all and they go to other services to train. But here we have these fantastic multi-floor units whereby we can create several dferent scenarios to help people be as safe as they possibly can.” Comment MORE ON Fire ServiceFire\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Weaposve had a look over some of the more interesting and shocking claims.  aposUnspoken codeapos Morton has become the latest in a line of experts and insiders to claim the Queenaposs heirs photo upset Meghan and Harry. To mark the start of , the Monarch shared a lovely photo of herself with Charles, William and our youngest future king - Prince George.  It was taken in Buckingham Palaceaposs Throne Room, and laid out the future of the British Monarchy as well as being a cute family photo. However there has been much speculation that the snap caused upset behind palace walls. Morton says Meghan and Harry saw the picture was unspoken code about their royal future, saying they suspected the entire institution was conspiring against them. Kate had aposno energyapos and Meghanaposs post-spat gt The book also touches on Meghan and Kateaposs relationship, something that has been of huge interest to fans. While royal watchers hoped the women would become strong friends, countless reports over the years suggests there have been tensions - with one insider simply saying they are very dferent.The book claims that Kate didnapost have much energy to get to know and bond with Meghan in the lead up to the Sussex wedding as she was going through a dficult pregnancy with Louis. Morton also claims that despite the tensions and much-discussed row between the women at a bridesmaid dress fitting, Meghan bought Kate a bracelet to thank her for the wedding preparation help.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .Morton describes the gold piece of jewellery, by Calornian jeweller Lisette Polny, as an elegant peace offering. He writes: The spat concerning the bridesmaids’ outfits now behind them, Meghan had since given Kate and her six closest friends gold bracelets designed by Calornian jeweller Lisette Polny as a thank-you for their help and support. Prince Harryaposs acupuncture and Queenaposs brutal put-down The lead up to Meghanaposs wedding to Harry is also covered extensively in the book - including the supposed disagreement over the tiara Meghan was going to wear on her big day. Morton claims Harry needed acupuncture to stay calm in the run-up to the wedding and was overwrought when the chosen tiara could not be made instantly available for Meghan’s hairdresser Serge Normant, who had flown from New York to work on the hair fitting. Morton says The Times reported how Meghan threw a tiara tantrum shortly before the wedding.  He writes: In November , just days after the couple ed from their successful tour Down Under, The Times reported that Meghan had thrown a ‘tiara tantrum’ shortly before her wedding because the tiara she wanted to wear was not available.Her prima-donna behaviour apparently earned a rebuke from the Queen herself, who told Harry: ‘She gets what tiara she’s given by me.’ Morton also claims Prince Harry was irate when Meghan did not get her way.He continues: The Queen’s formidable dresser Angela Kelly, who isof Her Majesty’s jewellery, is said to have informed the irate Prince that certain security protocols had to be adhered to in order to access the priceless piece. Harry would have none of it, telling anyone who would listen: ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.’ His ringing phrase did her no favours. Refusal to name Archieaposs godparents left Prince William aposperplexedapos After their wedding in May , Meghan gave birth to son Archie a year later, which according to the book merely reinforced their desire for privacy. When it came to the babyaposs christening two months later in July  at Windsor Castle, Harry and Meghan refused to make public the names of the people they had chosen to be Archieaposs godparents. And according to Morton, this left Harryaposs brother Prince William perplexed.He writes: The decision to keep the names of the godparents secret was another issue, one of many, that perplexed William. He, like others inside the family, felt that those chosen to guide and counsel a future royal prince, seventh in line to the throne, should be identied. Harry and Meghan thought otherwise. They explained that the godparents were genuine friends, not celebrities or public figures, and had joined with the royal couple in preferring privacy. Prince William aposbreathed a sigh of reliefapos when Meghan and Harry took break In September , Harry and Meghan embarked on a tour of South Africa taking young Archie with them.And a documentary later revealed the strain the couple had been feeling during that tour.In it, Prince Harry admitted to having a rt with William saying they have had “bad days”.  Harry said: “Part of this role and part of this job and this family being under the pressure that it’s under ­inevitably, you know, stuff happens. “But look, we’re brothers. We’ll always be brothers. At the time, a royal source said senior royals were “concerned for the couple”. And Morton writes: Like many others, Prince William breathed a sigh of relief when Harry and Meghan announced that they were stepping back from royal duties for six weeks or so and spending Thanksgiving and Christmas in North America. The couple ended up in a remote luxury mansion on Vancouver Island loaned to them by a patriotic Canadian businessman. Palace aides, who had been urging the couple to slow down, were pleased to see them take a breath. Meghan and Harry were driven out by Williamaposs alleged aposbullyingapos attitudeOne of the more shocking claims in the book is that Williamaposs alleged bullying caused a rt between the brothers.Morton writes: The Duchess of Cambridge’s coolness towards Meghan, and William’s alleged bullying contributed to a devastating ‘Cain and Abel’ fallout between the brothers. Harry was the ‘prime mover’ in souring relations between the Sussexes and the Royal Family, but it was Meghan who ‘took the hitapos. It has always been strongly denied that William bullied his family members. Last year, the brothers said they were deeply, deeply unhappy about bullying claims. The rare joint statement read: Despite clear denials, a  story ran in a UK newspaper today speculating about the relationship between The Duke of Sussex and The Duke of Cambridge. “For brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful.” Diana is aposthird wheelapos in Harry and Meghanaposs marriage Mortonaposs other famous book is his biography of Prince Harryaposs late mother Princess Diana and she is mentioned throughout the biography of Meghan.And he claims that Diana is a third wheel in the coupleaposs marriage and that her ghost” looms over the couple’s lives and defines their view of the world. He writes: The ghost of Diana, Princess of Wales loomed large over the lives of Harry and Meghan. She was essentially the third wheel in their marriage. Not a day went by without a reference, a memory or, perhaps more importantly, a decision relating to Harry’s beloved mother. Morton also claims family friends of Meghan have said she “wants to be Princess Diana .” and, aged , was deeply moved while watching Diana’s funeral with tears “coursing” down her cheeks. According to one childhood friend, Suzy Ardakani, Meghan would watch old videos of the  wedding of Diana to Prince Charles and the two girls – inspired by Diana’s humanitarian missions – collected clothes and toys for less privileged children. Suzy’s mother Sonia even gted Meghan a copy of Diana’s biography and it reportedly stood on her bookshelves for several years. Meghan found some members of the royal family unfriendly and jealous Another claim in the book is that Meghan found some members of the royal family unfriendly and jealous of her. Morton writes: It was clear that Meghan had ruffled feathers in the family and that they felt she and Harry were very dficult to deal with.  For her part, Meghan found some of its members – not the Queen or Prince Philip – unfriendly and jealous.At a personal level, then, their departure from Britain was quietly welcomed by some in the Windsor family and their courtiers, but on an institutional level it was a heavy blow. Harry made small steps to bridge rt with Prince Charles when he learned he had Covid Like many, Prince Harry was shocked when he learned his father Prince Charles tested positive for Covid- in March . And that along with his brother also having the virus, it saw them bridge the distance between them. Morton says: While Prince Charles’s condition was made public, with the Prime Minister very seriously ill, Prince William, who also contracted the dreaded disease, decided that at a time of national crisis he should keep his diagnosis a secret. Later reports suggested that the prince, although fit and healthy, was struggling to breathe. Harry’s phone calls to his father and brother helped in a small way to bridge the distance between them. He also contacted his grandmother to wish her luck before she made her historic and highly emotional ‘We Will Meet Again’ speech from Windsor Castle.Andrewaposs Mortonaposs updated version of Meghan: A Hollywood Princess is on sale online and in bookshops across the country from October .Comment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But siding with her son - in spite of his friendship with one of the worldaposs most notorious pedophiles - will be costly. Last week Andrew added Melissa Lerner to his legal team, the latest Lavley Singer lawyer to come on board after Andrew Brettler, who is said to be charging ,an hour as Andrewaposs lead counsel.

Schoolgirl Jorja Halliday, , initially had flu-like symptoms which soon developed into an inability to hold down water and severe heart palpitations. Her heart was beating at double its normal pace when she was rushed to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth. Jorja was put on a ventilator, but doctors were unable to stabilise her due to the immense strain on her heart. Mum Tracey Halliday held her daughteraposs hand as she died in hospital - four days after receiving her PCR test result. The hospitalaposs medical examiner said the courageous and kind-hearted schoolgirl had heart inflammation caused by the virus at the time of her death. Little sister Julie, , said a final goodbye to her beloved sibling in hospital shortly after her condition deteriorated.Every night since Jorjaaposs death Julie has cried herself to sleep, the Sun reports.  She said: We started bursting into tears. We sat down, held her hand and gave her hugs and kisses, and I gave her a matching teddy so me and and her have got matching teddies.After Jorjaaposs death, mum Tracey, , issued a warning to parents of children being too aposblaseapos about Covid. What began as a sore throat and the inability to eat, later turned into her incapacity to keep water down and the aspiring musician was rushed to hospital.Preliminary results from the hospitalaposs medical examiner indicate the aposbeautul young ladyapos had Covid myocarditis, heart inflammation caused by the virus. Her mother, Tracey Halliday, said: They realised how serious it was and I was still allowed to touch her, hold her hand, hug her and everything . They did allow me that. Iaposm at the point where I canapost comprehend that itaposs happened. I was with her the whole time. They tried to put her on a ventilator to give her body a chance to recover. Her heart rate didnapost stabilise. Her heart couldnapost take the strain. They worked as well as I think they could medically but were unable to save her. She had the best of care, I know that they did everything they could to save her. Itaposs heart wrenching because your kids are always meant to outlive you, and thataposs the one thing I canapost get over. I like to think of myself as a thinker, I like to keep busy but I do take some time for myself and grieve with the children, she said. Jorja was the eldest of five children. She had two sisters Julie, , and Daisie, four, and two younger brothers, Kallum, six, and Oscar who is just  months and too young to understand what has happened.  When Iaposm on my own, when theyaposve gone to bed, and when I get the reminders throughout the day, I burst into tears. She was a loving girl and she had lots of friends. She was very active, she liked to go out and spend time with her friends and loved spending time with her brothers and sisters. Growing up she turned into a beautul young lady, always wanting to help others, always there for everybody when they needed them, she continued. Ms Halliday fears children are too aposblaseapos about the virus - with parents presuming their kids will simply recover. She continued: She was going to have the jab on Tuesday. But because she tested positive on Saturday she was isolating. When her isolation period was over she was going to get it. The day that she passed away was the day that she would have had it done. The aposkind-heartedapos young girl died on September , outlived by her  year old grandmother, Julia Halliday, who said: She was everything. Her martial arts teacher, Badr Bahaj, said she was a aposrole modelapos to many of the other children at her training school, the AG Martial Arts centre in Portsmouth, Hants. He said: All the kids knew her and loved her and she was a role model to so many. Itaposs a shame and absolutely gutting. Jorja was one of the children that really did develop and thrive in our club. She wanted to teach it when she was older. She also had a passion for learning and martial arts was no exception. Itaposs devastating, itaposs going to break so many hearts. Sheaposs someone weaposll never forget. Sheaposs one of the star students. Before her passing, Jorja was working towards her GCSEs at The Portsmouth Academy, Hants, where she will be greatly missed.

They are going to go back as far as  years and work out as far as they can everywhere he has been. If he has done anything, they will find out. Couzens was told last week he will die in prison after being given a whole le sentence for the kidnap, rape and murder of Ms Everard.  At the time he was serving in the Met Police in an elite Westminster-based unit which protects diplomats, VIPs and high-profile buildings in the capital.On March , Couzens, who had finished a -hour sht in South London, abducted Sarah in a hire car as she walked home from a friendaposs house in Clapham at around pm.He had planned the crime for weeks before Sarah vanished and three days before her murder had hired a car from a rental company in Dover. He had also bought handcuffs on Amazon and that night on March , hairbands from Tesco.The Old Bailey heard that Couzens pretended to arrest Sarah in a fake Covid patrol and showed her his warrant card. The aposarrestapos took just five minutes. It was captured on CCTV and dashcam footage and witnessed by a couple in a car who assumed Sarah had done something wrong.Couzens then took her on a tortuous -mile journey to Dover before transferring her to his own car, raping and strangling her. Prosecutor Tom Little said Sarahaposs injuries were consistent with the suggestion that Couzens had strangled her with his police belt. He added that at some point after her arrest, having not been taken to a police station, Sarah Everard must have realised her fate.  The court heard that Sarah must have died before .am on March , as that was the time Couzens was seen on CCTV at a Dover petrol station buying Lucozade, two bottles of still water and an apple juice. After the murder Couzens’ phone was recorded near Ashford at am, when he is believed to have hidden her body inside a fly-tipped fridge in woods. As he sentenced Couzens, Lord Justice Fulford said Sarahaposs murder was devastating and tragic. Her loved ones cried as they watched Couzens being told he will die in prison. The judge added that the killing happened in wholly brutal circumstances and Sarah was a wholly blameless victim of a grotesque series of circumstances that culminated in her death.

Jenni Medlam, , and husband Richard, , were delighted by the birth of baby Isla-May in June after being told the unexpected news by their daughter Charmaine. Having given birth to Charmaine herself when she was , Jenni was determined to support her child when she became pregnant at the age of . However, the new grandmother admits that when the couple, from Hull, take Isla-May out for a walk, strangers get the shock of their le.Get the biggest news delivered to your inbox.for the Mirroraposs free newslettersWhen we are out with Isla everyone just assumes that she is mine and Richardaposs daughter, she says. When we explain to them that we are actually grandparents they get the absolute shock of their le. Most people donapost believe us when we tell them. But I can obviously understand why people would think we are her parents as we are still in our early thirties.  When Charmaine first told her parents that she was pregnant, Jenni - who was  when Isla-May was born - admits they were really shocked. However, after coming to terms with the news, she now says they are both loving their new roles. Iaposm Nanna and Richard is Gapospa, she says. Being young grandparents just means you have more time to love your grandchild and longer to cherish them. And we might even get great-grandchildren. After becoming a teenage mum herself, Jenni - who also has two other daughters, Chy, , and Scarlett,  - didnapost have a support network to help her through it and she was very isolated. Jenni didnapost want her daughter to have the same experience as she did and vowed to support her. I knew exactly how Charmaine would be feeling having to tell her mum she was pregnant, she says. But I told her itaposs her body and her decision and I would support her either way. And since falling pregnant it has really made Charmaine grow up, Isla has been the making of her. She is an incredible mum and I think it has made the bond between Charmaine and me even stronger. I think she has even more respect for me now as her mum Charmaine has been with her partner, the babyaposs father, for nearly two years and Jenni says their whole family all live under one roof together. The loving grandparents regularly look after little Isla to give Charmaine a break. I think itaposs brought us all even closer, she adds. My other girls absolutely love having a baby in the house, they love having a niece. Jenni, who runs her own cleaning business, thinks that teenage mums are stereotyped but insists that having a baby doesnapost mean your le is over. She says that although she was a teen mum, she was still able to work and bring up her daughter, and even start her own business. Charmaine has watched me go to work and do well for myself while bringing her up, so she knows itaposs possible, she explains. She wants to go to college and do beauty. There is a stereotype about young mums which I donapost think is fair. You can still enjoy your le and achieve whatever you want evenyou have a baby when youaposre younger. I am glad that I am able to show my daughter that everything can still work out for you.Want to share your story  Get in touch by emailing alex.bellotti@reachplcComment MORE ON BabiesParenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Separate videos show the small gator struggling as the bigger one keeps it underwater. The smaller reptile tries to escape as its tail flaps weakly, but cannot fight off the bigger one.The video was filmed in a yard in Murrells Inlet on Thursday and was published on Twitter by Taylor Soper.He wrote: This happened in my parents backyard today… The snack is a ft gator.

Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Mr Soper added the small alligator actually ate a small baby last weekend, days before being killed. He explained: What’s really cool is we saw the one that’s getting eaten in this video eat a small baby last weekend so there’s some craziness going on over there. The footage attracted numerous comments and shares on Twitter, with a person writing: Wait… the gator ate another gator ! ! Thats a thing !  Another person added: We did a gator tour in New Orleans and the guide said he always takes the baby gators and raises them until they are big enough to fight off the bigger ones because they eat their young. One more said: Drain the pond, fill with concrete and never speak of this again. Fish and Wildle officials explained that it is normal behaviour for alligators to eat each other. FWC officer Gary Morse explained: What alligators will typically do is theyaposll take that animal and stuff it some place for a week or two until it gets nice and soft and they can tear it apart. He added: Sometimes it can be territorial, but very often alligators are cannibalistic. The expert said males are usually more aggressive, particularly during mating season, which takes place in May and June, with nesting in late June and July.

Spain’s Costa Blanca resort had been turned into a “ghost town” by the UK’s curbs because of Covid, said one expat. Business owners and Brits who work in Benidorm have told of their relief. Some British expats revealed earlier this year they had been relying on food banks after losing jobs because of the lack of UK tourists. Former nurse Wayne Wright, who works as a drag Queen Levi in Benidorm’s Palladium, said: “It’s got really, really busy now. “It has been terrible, it’s been like a ghost town and we have not worked for  months.  “It’s absolutely wonderful to see the British holidaymakers back. “Without the British tourists, Benidorm is nothing. Benidorm thrives on the working class British.” Wayne said bars and hotels have been refurbished and are crying out for staff. The owner of Bar Rumbo, Antonio Garcia, , which has been operating since the s, said: “There are quite a few British back now and they love Benidorm.“It’s the weather, the tolerant and nice Spanish people, the food is very good too and prices are brilliant.I think September is going to be really good.”  Holidaymakers are revelling in the sunshine and temperatures which are expected to peak at C this week. Alex Fratini, a member of Benidorm bar and restaurant association added: “Many businesses have reopened after many months closed because the Brits have started to .” Association president Javier del Castillo told local paper Diario Informacion: “Businesses are reopening and opening for longer. We hope this continues and more Brits come.”  Toni Mayor, from the local hoteliers association, added: “The situation has improved dramatically. There’s a British atmosphere in Benidorm which reminds me of before the pandemic. “Around  per cent of holidaymakers are British and with the other  per cent who’ll hopefully , we’ll be back to the way things were.

For two years, a -strong team of reporters organised by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalistshave been pouring through the . million leaked files, finding and verying stories which are being published this week.  The files, shared by  sources, are believed to be the biggest leak of their kind in history, and name more than  politicians from  countries as well as  billionaires.and BBC have led the UKaposs investigation, which have named a number of high-profile politicians and world leaders. Here the Mirror looks at some of the biggest stories so far. Tony Blair saved Stamp Duty worth £, on London officeFormer UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and his we Cherie Blair are among those named in the papers, after they came to own a £. million office in Marylebone which Mrs Blair uses for her firm Omina Strategy. Normally, a commercial purchase of a £.m property would rack up £, in Stamp Duty. But the bill was not incurred because rather than the townhouse itself being sold, the British Virgin Islands-based firm which owned it - Romanstone International Limited - was bought by the the Blairs. The pair have furiously denied wrongdoing after their financial arrangements emerged in the Pandora Papers.  The Blairs quickly shut down the offshore company that had owned the townhouse, and the townhouse is now owned by a UK company which Mr and Mrs Blair jointly own. There is no suggestion any rules or laws were broken, although the sale highlights a loophole which has allowed wealthy property buyers to not pay a tax which ordinary Brits must pay. A spokeswoman said: The vendor was an offshore company. The Blairs had nothing whatsoever to do with the original company nor those behind it. The vendor sold the company not the property - again a decision the Blairs had nothing to with. Since the purchase was of a company no buyer would have had to pay UK stamp duty on that transaction. However, because the Blairs then repatriated the company and brought it onshore, they are liable for capital gains and other taxes on the resale of the property which will signicantly exceed any stamp duty. For the record, the Blairs pay full tax on all their earnings. And have never used offshore schemes either to hide transactions or avoid tax. King of Jordan amassed £million property empire across UK and US Jordanaposs King Abdullah, a close ally of the United States, was alleged to have used offshore accounts to spend more than  million on luxury homes in the United Kingdom and the United States. The nation is currently the recipient of a substantial amount of international aid, including from the US and UK, although lawyers for the king said he used his personal wealth to buy  homes in the two nations since he assumed power in . It also comes as he faced unrest at home over policies of austerity measures and tax rises, with protests taking place.  The leak comes a year after Jordinian authorities announced a crackdown on money being sent abroad by its citizens. DLA Piper, a London law office representing Abdullah, told the consortium of media outlets that he had not at any point misused public monies or made any use whatsoever of the proceeds of aid or assistance intended for public use. The royal palace has said King Abdullahaposs ownership of the properties was not a secret, but concerns over privacy and security were behind the reason for not disclosing them. Major Conservative Party donor involved in one of Europeaposs biggest corruption scandals A major Conservative Party donor is among those named in the leak. Mohamed Amersi, , has given nearly £, to the party since , but the papers allege he was involved in one of Europeaposs biggest corruption scandals. The corporate lawyer is alleged to have worked on a series of controversial dealings for Swedish telecoms company Telia which was later fined min a prosecution in the US. Mr Amersi reportedly advised Telia on a £m deal with the daughter of Uzbekistan’s former ruler Islam Karimov – a payment which US authorities later described as a “bribe”.  Telia later accepted that the money given to Gulnara Karimova was a “corrupt payment”. Mr Amersi’s lawyers have denied he “knowingly” helped facilitate any corrupt payments and had “no reason” to believe the money given to Ms Karimova would be a bribe. They added that the plans for a deal were already in place two years before he became involved. They said underlying arrangements for the deal were in place two years before his involvement.The leak comes as the Conservative Party gather in Manchester for their party conference, with Chancellor Rishi Sunak pledging to scour the papers for evidence of tax avoidance.Mr Sunak, who is very wealthy, has denied ever benefitting from an offshore arrangement. He told Sky News: “No. I haven. I’ve seen these things overnight … and of course HMRC will look through those to seethere’s anything we can learn.” Shakira used offshoreentities in the British Virgin Islands to conceal assets The Hips Donapost Lie singer is accused in the papers of setting up offshore entities in the British Virgin Islands. The -year-oldaposs lawyers have said she declared the offshore companies, and said their existence did not provide tax advantages.  Shakira is already in a legal dispute with the Spanish government, which has accused her of failing to pay taxes in Spain in the years ,  and . The singer has said during that time she was not a resident in Spain and was living in the Bahamas. In July, a Spanish judge ruled there was sufficient evidence to try her for evading more than £million in taxes. Azerbaijanaposs ruling Aliyev family secretly gathered UK propertyThe Azerbaijan ruling Aliyev family have been accused of secretly gathering UK property using offshore bank accounts. The files show how the family - long accused of corruption in the European nation - bought  properties, including an office blockin  for £million. However, one month later was transferred to their -year-old son Heydar Aliyev.  The research also revealed how another office block owned by the family nearby was sold to the Crown Estate for £m in . The Crown Estate said it carried out the checks required in law at the time of purchase but is now looking into the matterreported the property acted as a front for family of Azerbaijanaposs President Ilham Aliyev whose record has long been criticised by anti-corruption campaigners. A spokesman for the Crown Estate said: Before our purchase of - Conduit Street, we conducted checks including those required by UK law. At the time we did not establish any reason why the transaction should not proceed. Given the potential concerns raised, we are looking into the matter. Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta under pressure to explain how relatives amassed million in offshore wealthKenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta is among the world leaders named in the papers. He and six of his relatives have gathered millionin offshore wealth , including property in London, the papers revealed.Kenyatta has long portrayed himself as an enemy to corruption, and in  told he BBC: “Every public servant’s assets must be declared publicly so that people can question and ask: what is legitimate   Putin linked to secret assets in MonacoThe leak links Russian President Vladimir Putin to secret assets in Monaco, including an exclusive block underneath the Monte Carlo Casino, bought in  for £.m, for his alleged lover, reports the . The official purchaser was listed as Brockville Development Ltd, an offshore company in the British Virgin Islands, but the papers reveal the benefactor was Svetlana Krivonogikh. The then--year-old came from humble beginnings but appears to have acquired Putin as a financial benefactor in the s. She is said to have met him while he was St Petersburgaposs deputy mayor and become his lover, allegedly giving birth to his daughter the same year the Monaco apartment was bought. But according to the Pandora papers, some of Putin’s inner circle also used Monaco as a discreet hub for their financial affairs, with Russian influence in the state growing.

Why not just open sessions up again and more of them #The mum said daughter Meredith had been going to swimming lessons through Sport Aberdeen, which were stopped for a year because of the pandemic. This means she hasn#t been able to progress with swimming and is still in level one.Meanwhile, her middle child William is waiting for a space to open up for swimming lessons because of the delay in children moving up a level.She said: #We’re in this massive city and we’ve got all these pools, but we don’t have any resources to take our kids swimming. My main priority is to make sure my kids are safe in the water and that they enjoy it.#While other parents have suggested travelling further afield for swimming, to Altens or Westhill, Ms Kinsbury has questioned why more sessions can#t be made available in the city.Ms Kinsgbury commented: #It#s such a shame. Why am I needing to go into Aberdeenshire when I should have facilities in my city #David Selkirk, director of community leisure operations for Sport Aberdeen, said the timetable is under review due to the #high demand# for public swim sessions # and that work is ongoing to reopen Get Active at Lochside.He explained that the public sessions at Tullos had only been in place until the primary four lessons that Sport Aberdeen deliver on behalf of Aberdeen City Council resumed.Mr Selkirk said: #While we do offer ious citywide public swim sessions throughout the week and family swim sessions at weekends, we recognise that demand for public swimming is high and we are currently reviewing our timetables to find any additional opportunities to increase capacities and extend some of our sessions.#We are working to the very best of our ability under the strained circumstances and have made changes where possible to accommodate as many swimmers as physically possible.#Any revisions will go live on Sport Aberdeen#s timetable after the October holidays.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

Academics agree that a sustainable level of material use, which would still allow for a high quality of le, is about eight tonnes per person per year.Zero Waste Scotland is advocating for mindful shopping, encouraging Scots to buy smarter and adopt reuse, repair and renting behaviours as well as embracing second-hand shopping.When finished with an item, it is calling on people to dispose of items responsibly by donating, reselling or recycling.With global climate change discussions at an all-time high and COP coming to Glasgow this November, the topic of responsible consumption in relation to the climate crisis has never been more timely.Everything we buy has a carbon cost and we are urging Scots to think dferently about what we buy and how we consume.Changing our own consumption habits is the single biggest thing we can all do to play our part in tackling climate change.Now is the time for action and we want people to bin less and buy better, seeking out items which will last longer.Responsible consumption isn’t on the COP agenda so we wanted to ensure it is top of the consumer agenda.To learn more about the campaign, please visit www.howtowasteless for further details.Iain Gulland, chief executive, Zero Waste Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another.

We were delighted to welcome them to Argyll for their first performance as a quartet and for three of the four performers this was the first time they had performed in more than a year.The quartet # Andrew, Dean, Jack and Richard # introduced each piece, giving background to both the role of the saxophone and the composer, with many of the pieces arranged by the group themselves.Purcell’s #Festival Rondeau# was the dramatic opening, a work well-known across all age groups, so a perfect start to the concert.Following this was a work composed specically for a saxophone quartet in  by Jean-Baptiste Singelée, a friend of Adolph Sax who invented the saxophone. We were treated to the traditional Andante before moving onto the exciting Allegro.The third selection of pieces were all by Debussy. This was a surprising choice as the saxophone is not really associated with the Impressionist period, however, it showed the versatility of both the saxophones and performers. #Arabesque No.# was followed by #The Little Shepherd# which was delightful, calm and serene with only the sound of the river flowing through the trees and birds singing along. The jaunty #Cakewalk# completed this ied section.#Air on a G String# by Bach and known to many as a TV advert was the next offering. The opening descending bass line showed the depth and quality of the baritone saxophone in much more than just a supporting role. This music predates the invention of the saxophone by more than  years.Gershwin and a selection of show tunes from the swing era were just what we needed after the relaxing #Air#. The four musical songs, all showcasing dferent styles, certainly had the audience smiling, toe-tapping and singing along. In the final piece #I Got Rhythm# we were all moving to the music, including the quartet. Closing your eyes, you could imagine you were relaxing in a jazz club anywhere in the world.The next piece, #L’Arlesienne Exhibition#, is a collection of highlights for the saxophone in an orchestral situation. The music was composed by Hiroki Takahashi, with many familiar themes from film and TV # including The Apprentice # all thoroughly enjoyable.Gershwin’s #An American in Paris# portrays the many sights and sounds that Gershwin experienced there in the s. While it was composed for an orchestra which included saxophones and car horns, the music played by the quartet didn’t include any car horns # just skilled and imaginative saxophonists.A change of pace to enjoy some relaxed, laid-back music from West Africa followed with Will Gregory’s #High Le#. The repeated rhythms with the peace of Kilmory, the cooling air and the gentle river flowing was almost hypnotic and brought the concert to a finish.The audience cheered, clapped and blew their cars horns to ensure the quartet provided an encore. #Witch Hunt# by Ulrich Schultheiss was the encore # a dramatic and fiery work challenging all the performers and bringing a fantastic concert to a close.The quartet members themselves didn#t feel the cars were a barrier and said they #had a blast at a unique and special event#.MAAA thank the th Argyll Scoutsfor helping with the car parking.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

Try and get evergreens planted by the end of the month.Dormant roses are now available at local nurseries and garden centres and are very good value for money.You can easily create a rose garden for the coming year that will provide beautul flowers and fragrance from early summer through to autumn. Before planting, mix in some good quality compost and make sure the plants are watered well once planted.It#s an excellent time to plant coners as well. Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces, and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is Heuchera.Native to north America, Heuchera were originally grown for their flowers # dainty spikes of red, pink and white bells.They carry their plume like flowers high above their crowns of leaves, but gardeners are now mainly interested in their foliage which comes in a iety of colours.Heucheras grow in full or partial sun, in well composted soil and are fairly pest resistant.They can be established as ground cover in many garden situations like under trees where grass could struggle.October is often a time spent clearing up after the summer and preparing for the winter and wpring ahead so here are some top tips for jobs this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"gardens of argyll in new tv series","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowTwo Argyll gardens will appear in a new BBC ALBA series which started last week.Gàrraidhean Mòra na h-Alba, or Gardens of Scotland is presented by Murdo Macdonald, and the programme will feature Ardkinglas and Benmore gardens.In a programme screened on Thursday September  and available on BBC iPlayer, it was the turn of Ardkinglas Garden at the head of Loch Fyne.There, Murdo finds out about the model railway that used to run along the lochside, and wanders around the azaleas bursting with colour in the Ladies# Garden.He walks up to the old mill by the river, then explores the champion trees and renowned rhododendron collection in the Woodland Garden.He also finds out more about the fairy garden for children which is made up of lots of little houses next to the bottom of tree trunks, laid out in trail.#The fairy garden attracts thousands of families each year so it#s become a destination in itself,# said Murdo. #The Ladies# Garden with azaleas is also well worth seeing in summer it’s stunning because it#s ablaze with colour.#On October , Gàrraidhean Mòra na h-Alba will showcase Benmore Garden at the end of Loch Eck, a regional garden of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.Murdo visits the Victorian fernery, the Tasmanian Ridge and the Chilean Rainforest Glade, where he plants a monkey puzzle tree.Murdo said: #Benmore is a dramatic garden in its terrain with amazing views and you could easily spend days walking around, just taking in what’s there.#There’s a wildness to the garden that isn’t as apparent at some of the other more formal gardens which can almost make you feel as though you’re in a dferent country.#"},{"url":null,"title":"glendaruel hosts tighnabruaich open","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowGlendaruel and Colintraive Gun Club hosted the Tighnabruaich Open on September , the first club competition to be held since March .The High Gun of the day, after a three-way shoot off, was Ted Blakeway.In second was Alan Brown third, Paul Chalmers and fourth equal were Martin Young,  Gordon Grfiths and Eric McAllister.The ladies prize went to Jessica Young.

This included him having a relapse when we thought we might lose him.He was diagnosed with an autoimmune condition and needed a long course of treatment and regular blood tests but thankfully he pulled through.Sadly, Red’s story is not an isolated case. Many animals arrive with us when they are literally broken.Some have suffered for a long time, carrying physical and emotional scars. Animals can’t tell us where it hurts, why they’re sick or why they’re scared.It’s our job to uncover what has happened to the animals and what treatment they need.Red’s happy ending is the best possible outcome for us. To see the broken animals which arrive with us go on to loving forever homes. It’s the reason we do what we do.We don’t just fix broken bones. We fix broken hearts too.The Scottish SPCA receives no government funding and is entirely reliant on donations from the public.To find out more about our Broken campaign and becoming a member of the Scottish SPCA, visit www.scottishspca.org brokenanimals.Jo Neilson, Scottish SPCA senior vet"},{"url":null,"title":"action packed day for young soccer stars","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is heuchera.Native to North America, heucheras were originally grown for their flowers – dainty spikes of red, pink and white bells.They carry their plume like flowers high above their crowns of leaves, but gardeners are now mainly interested in their foliage which comes in a iety of colours.Heucheras grow in full or partial sun, in well composted soil and are fairly pest resistant.They can be established as ground cover in many garden situations like under trees where grass could struggle.October is often a time spent clearing up after the summer and preparing for the winter and spring ahead so here are some top tips for jobs next month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"connor is tarberts junior champion","story":"The threat of wet and windy weather did not daunt the enthusiasm of the young golfers, who took part in three dferent competitions.The junior champion was Connor MacRae, group three champion was Aiden Kerr, group two champion was Jack Sinclair and group one champion was Macey Fair.As part of their prizes, the children received a British Open top from Portrush which was kindly signed by European Tour star Robert MacIntyre.#Congratulations to everyone who participated and many thanks to Lesley at Loch Fyne Gallery for her sponsorship,# said a club spokesperson.#Thanks to Captain Kenny for organising the coaching and the championship.

he turned provider for sweeper John McCallum to side-foot firmly home from close range to get the Pupils off the mark.Into the latter stages, the scores could have been higher on both sides, prevented

There were two lighthouses at the harbour entrance: one on a northern clf and the other to the south. These were intended to guide vessels through the portrsquos channel which had dangerous sand banks on either side.ldquoBut heavy rain prevented The Starrsquos crew from seeing the lights properly and there was a breakwater to be avoided before the harbour could be taken.ldquoOn entering the port, a huge wave bore down on the boat, threatening to throw it onto the breakwater.ldquoThe crew took what evasive action they could but, sadly, the boat was dashed against the masonry pier with such force that she quickly broke up with the tragic loss of all the crew but one.An active search was made but none of the bodies were reportedly found at that time.Almost five months later, the body of the skipper was found by fisherman William Cross, washed ashore at Dunwich, on March , .Newspapers reported at the time of memorial services being held in Musselburgh and visits made to grief-stricken families by the provost.Stuart Ritchie said it was believed that the skipperrsquos body was the only one found.He said: ldquoAfter a good deal of searching over a period of time, recently I found my great grandfatherrsquos death certicate. I feel very sad that, apparently, Jamesrsquos body was never found so a funeral may never have taken place.But he added: ldquoIt is good that the descendants are meeting up.ldquoIt would be even betterthe wider community in the Musselburgh Fisherrow area was made aware of this heritage and perhaps the local authority could do a bit to help here.He felt a lasting memorial to the crew of Star of the East at Fisherrow Harbour would be a fitting tribute to them.Mr Johnston added: ldquoAttending our harbour ceremony felt like stepping back into the past to remember and honour, not only James Ritchie and the other brave men of The Star who lost their lives, but also to allow us today to pay tribute to every family within the Fisherrow fishing community for the important contribution it has made to the economy and history of Musselburgh over many years.Walter Brown jnrrsquos great grandson Walter Moffat, , who lives in Toronto, Canada, visited the skipper Walter Brown snrrsquos grave at Dunwich in early  where a memorial stone had been placed by his widow Jane lsquoBonthronrsquo Brown.He said his ancestor was seen by commanding everyone to ldquosave themselves as he held the mast going down with the ship.ldquoCoincidentally, Walter Brown jnr forgot to take his bible on that trip ndash I have it at home, said his descendant who is the grandson of Walter Brown, the son of Walter Brown jr and Elizabeth Brown , who was just one when his father died in the shipwreck.The Scottish Fisheries Museum at Anstruther is planning to mark the th anniversary of the loss of The Star at its annual memorial service in the museumrsquos Memorial Room in October.

It captures an imagined moment in which the legendary Viking Althamer sails along the coast of the Firth of Forth.It is the work of Andrew Hillhouse, an artist who sadly died in  at the young age of . I wish I had been wise enough to seek him out and talk with him about history and his art when Irsquod had the opportunity.His widow Vicky has told me of his modesty, that he wouldnrsquot call himself an artist because he was a working man with a job to pay the bills. He once wrote that he was ldquostill just a guy who likes to doodle in his spare time.Some doodles! His art is stunning: full of historical detail and atmosphere, and his work portrays many aspects of Scottish history, which was one of Andrewrsquos passions.His website has many more examples of his art, with short explanations to accompany them.He grew up in Prestonpans and knew the local legend of the townrsquos beginnings that it was founded by a Viking traveller named Althamer, who was shipwrecked with his crew on its rocky shore after a ferocious storm about a thousand years ago in the th century.As Andrew himself wrote: ldquoStories from this period are very dficult to very, but the legend persists to this dayhellip the image shows Althamerrsquos ship passing Bass Rock as the sun sets on the evening before their hard landing on Scotlandrsquos shores.But although this is a legend and not history, we do know that there was Viking activity around East Lothianrsquos shores in the th century. For example, it is recorded that the Norse king of Dublin, Olaf Guthfrithson, raided Tyninghame in AD and died soon afterwards.And perhaps he lies buried there. In , the farmer at Auldhame, Mr Dale, ploughed up bones. An archaeological dig took place and an Anglo Saxon monastery was revealed. A male skeleton was discovered buried there with items that identy him as being a high-ranking Norse warrior.It canrsquot be said for sure the skeleton was the remains of King Olaf himself. But itrsquos a fascinating possibility.The thing is, we have tiny historical glimpses of this time, with archaeology sometimes adding to our knowledge while also sometimes adding to the intrigue.To this, we can add the stories, told down the generations, at the firesides of the common folk. These stories often had their origin in an account of someonersquos experience, or a memory of an event, which then evolved to become part of folklore and legend.Since the story of Althamerrsquos arrival was set in a time of extensive Norse and Danish settlement, the idea of Prestonpans being founded by a shipwrecked Viking is not entirely fancul. There was, after all, a Viking settlement a few miles down the coast at Luffness, by Aberlady Bay.So Andrewrsquos image of Althamer and his crew sailing to their fate along the East Lothian coast is now part of the telling of this legend.The story lit my imagination and interest in history when I was a youngster growing up in Prestonpans. It still does.Irsquove often stood on its shore in a storm to watch the waves crash against the rocks in a rage, and see in my mindrsquos eye the Viking longboat being smashed.There is so much in this picture for you to discover, and it speaks more words than I can write.So I will leave it with you.It is produced here with thanks from Vicky Hillhouse, who gave her permission to use it on this page.But she has also kindly given permission for its use by local schoolchildren, who are now the younger custodians of the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"sight-loss-support-a-blessing-prestonpans-resident-agnes-78","story":"Agnes Stevenson, , of Grant Road, received her age-related macular degeneration diagnosis in  when she was a full-time carer for husband Tom, who had dementia and passed away last year.Struggling with the impact of her sight loss, Agnes reached out to the charity Sight Scotland through its newly launched telephone support line ndash she has since praised the community service for helping her feel less alone.The Sight Scotland Support Line, launched across Edinburgh and the Lothians in January as part of the newly formed Family Wellbeing Service which launched last Wednesday, offers people with sight loss and their families someone to turn to for information, advice and support.The retired bookkeeper said: ldquoI didnrsquot know anything about macular degeneration.ldquoWhen I was told I had it, I was devastated.ldquoAt that time, I got no information at all.ldquoIt was a huge shock.

Younger fought to keep steel making in Scotland. He fought to make Prestwick the main cargo hub in the UK, an eminently sensible idea. That he lost to vested southern interestsisnrsquot the issue.Contrast him with the present and previous Secretaries of State, Alister Jack and David Mundell. Like Scottish Tory MPs in general, they simply do not fight on any issue for what used to be called the ldquoScottish Interest. That is the problem for Mr Ross not ldquoclass.Add to that the advancement of an oligarch like Malcolm Offord, a man who apparently believes in cutting state expenditure by one-third , and it seems the Scottish Tories are more in tune with the s than the s. I do not regard ldquonationalism as a real issue in Scotland, butit were, then Mr Ross should be aware that ldquoScottish nationalism would always be preferred over ldquoBritish nationalism.GR Weir, Ochiltree.UNTRUTHS FROM DOUGLAS ROSSIT constantly amazes me ndash but why should it  ndash that politicians can twist the truth any which way they want. In the row over Labour deputy leader Angela Raynerrsquos comments regarding ldquoTory scum, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives suggests at the Tory conference she was referring to the votersand describes them as ldquonormal Scots looking for a party that can stand up to the SNP. They are people like me, my family and my community.Douglas Ross says: ldquoThese voters arenrsquot as Angela Rayner would say lsquovilersquo. They arenrsquot lsquonasty. They arenrsquot lsquoscumrsquo.Ms Rayner was reported as saying: \"We cannot get any worse than a bunch of scum, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, absolute pile of banana republic, vile, nasty, Etonian, posh... piece of scum. Some quote that! But the fact is she wasnrsquot talking about the voters, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson and members of his party.So why is Mr Ross allowed to make  accusations and see them reported without any debate Is he simply following his leader and learning the best way forward is to continue to tell untruths because voters donrsquot know any better  And would he tell himself thatrsquos what ldquonormal Scots would expect Andy Stenton, Glasgow.SWISS SYSTEM WOULD HAVE SUITED USON one hand it is encouraging that Peter Russellrsquos proposal for a new Act of Union would include the right of one nation to \"withdraw\" unilaterally . It is though telling that the requirements he would impose for that nation to do so are not the traditional requirements of the UK polity. The tradition in the UK, which has been used in every election with the exception of the Scottish Assembly referendum in , has been ldquoone vote is enough.Philosophically I can understand Mr Russellrsquos point, but does he not recognise thatthere is to be such a rupture in UK tradition that there is some onus on him to justy this  Political expedience wrapped up in philosophical principle is not a justication for abandoning tradition.I would say Brexit was a major change, but had it come to it, one vote would have been enough. Brexit, as Mr Russell says, might have been a debacle, and like him I consider it a terrible act, but it is the tradition of how the UK does politics.Perhaps mindful of this, the majority requirements he cites are from other than the UK: Switzerland and the United States. The former is particularly interesting, since what he meansis that for a proposition to pass, there must be a national majority but also a majority of Cantons . Applied to the UK, Brexit would never have happened as two \"cantons\" ndash Scotland and Northern Ireland ndash voted Remain, so denying the double majority that would have been required, had this been the UK tradition. Politically that would have been most interesting in the UK but would be accepted in Switzerland as part of their political tradition.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.BREXIT HAS NOT FUELLED INDY VOTEI WOULD like to thank Ruth Marrfor her response to my letter of October . However, in doing so I fear all she has done is confirm the two main problems the independence movement suffers from: preaching only to the choir and deflecting away from the failures of the SNP.Ms Marr is absolutely right when she notes it is up to the unionists to make the case for the Union. What she and many of her fellow independence supporters fail to understand, and the point I was making, is that a similar burden rests on them to show why independence is better than the status quo. They failed to do this in  and need to convince people like me who voted against independence that it is worth it.I should point out that by Ms Marrrsquos own logic this should be simple. If it is better then it should be easy to list the places where Holyrood is better. Instead, the list of failings from both governments is staggering. While I am old enough to remember a time when the SNP was not in power at Holyrood, people currently reaching voting age are not. And they are much more likely to know who is in charge of what in Scotland and who to blame.As for her reference to Brexit, it should be noted that while Scots may not like Brexit, that does not mean they want to vote for independence to escape it. Support for independence did not increase after the Brexit vote it has not increased much in the years since. In fact, the only time support got above % for anyof time was when the SNP stopped talking about independence to deal with the pandemic. Food for thought there.John Shanks, Glasgow.FIGHT FOR A BETTER UNIONRUTH Marr states the untruth which she frequently peddles, about \"crucial decisions affecting Scotland which are made at Westminster by a government Scotland did not elect\". As Ms Marr knows only too well, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has only one main government, democratically elected, and it is up to us to vote as we see fit when a General Election takes place then she states that \"we are currently suffering the consequences of being dragged out of the European Union by a Tory government\". As Ms Marr knows, we were dragged out of Europe because the majority of our population voted to do just that ndash not just against a healthy \"no\" vote from Scotland, but also many other areas of the UK, including London and its surrounding areas. Lastly she states \"independence is normal for almost every other country in the world\". Scotland is a normal country, and part of the United Kingdom, and therefore independent.I do not knowMs Marr has read Ian R Hamiltons book, No Stone Unturned, retelling the theft of the Stone of Destiny, but that gentleman ndash a strong nationalist ndash makes a fascinating statement as part of his introduction to his book: \"If we do not solve the problem of Scottish government, people less moderate than we are will sweep us aside and make of Scotland another Ireland. Our fight is not for separation, but for a better Union, and as such we conceive it to be the concern of every one in the United Kingdom, whether he be Welsh or Irish, Scottish or English.\"Walter Paul, Glasgow.MOVE IN WITH THE NEIGHBOURSBRIAN Taylor implies that anything north of Hadrianrsquos Wall is part of Scotland , and lots of other writers equate the Scottish English border with Hadrianrsquos Wall. It would be a good ideawe made this a fact by annexing the north of Northumberland to Scotland. The countryside is beautul, the towns lively, and the people are friendly. This would help to \"level up\" the size of Scotland compared to England, and probably reduce the demand for Scottish independence.Helen Ross, Bridge of Allan.FRIENDLY DISAGREEMENTI WELCOME Michael Sheridanrsquos responseto Neil Mackayrsquos call that we should ldquodo better in the constitutional debate.Some of my best friends are adherents to the SNP cause. They are of course mistaken. But theyrsquore still my best friends.R Russell Smith, Largs.Read more: Keep tribalised blindness out of the Scottish independence debate"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-wind-turbines-acceptable-price-pay-cleaner-power-supplies","story":"As an engineer I personally find them pleasing works of design in appearance and fully acceptable in todays world. I have also visited Scotlands hills and coasts over many years, from Sutherland to the borders and all in between. Pylons and towers have not distracted my appreciation or love of our beautul land.Now aged  I recall my childhood in Bridgeton, Glasgow, walking to Hosier Street Primary in the late s in yellow smog-filled streets with my handkerchief tied round my nose and mouth. On removal the white hanky had two dark brown holes for nostrils. And all done four times per day, sometimes for days on end.The effect on Glasgow citizens health was immense in terms of lung disease. The cause was from coal-burning in every tenement and factory chimney.In time smoke controls were implemented but years of work then followed as the city erected scaffolding and buildings were shot-blasted to rediscover the beautul architecture hidden beneath the soot encrusted walls.Part of the Glasgow skyline was also peppered with huge structures called gasometers, like grotesque alien ships, for storing the city gas supplies. Great rusting hulks which rise and fall depending on the volume of gas inside. Not pretty to look at but necessary for the citizens needs at the time.Coal has gone. Nuclear has risks as in Fukashima and Three Rivers events. Oil is to be transitioned away from. So wind and solar has to be in the mix with possibly new hydrogen power options. We just cant have our pristine countryside and reliable power supplies without some penalties. Sorry, but it cant be done.Bob Wolfenden, Biggar.AVOID KNEE-JERK EVERARD RESPONSEI READ with interest the letter from Denis Bruce .He makes a number of well thought-out and well-intentioned suggestions, several of which are unfortunately unworkable.All the talk of ldquo the arrestee and about at least two officers and no handcuffs is commendable but would change nothing and could in fact make matters worse.Back in the day I made more than one off-duty arrest whilst alone. For example, one was in the middle of the night and it was an inidual who had broken into several cars and stolen a lot of property. Another was in the middle of the afternoon. I had become suspicious and followed an inidual into a very secluded wooded area. He was with a very young and very distressed child and I intervened seconds before before he raped her. He was a big man with inordinate strength. This was horric andMr Bruce had his way then presumably I would have had to just stand by Regarding handcuffs only for violent prisoners, then this takes no account of those who subsequently become violent or who secrete drugs or weapons on their person. They need to be secured before they can dispose of the drugs or use the weapon against the arresting officer.The events surrounding Sarah Everard are beyond evil. I truly cannot think of a more horric set of circumstances. I am confident that every serving and retired police officer , will be embarrassed, ashamed and mortied.I think it is incumbent on the entire police service , to carry out a root and branch reform of its recruitment processes and what should be far more stringent processes applicable to those who become authorised firearms officers . We currently have interviews, written exams, assessment processes for normal recruits and psychometric testing for AFOs but clearly this monster slipped through the net. The police service could take advice from other police agencies throughout the world and they could look at how operatives to our internal secret services within the UK are recruited. The police service clearly do not have a monopoly on all the answers.Something is wrong and needs fixed. It needs to be done calmly, and methodically. It cannot be done as a knee-jerk reaction.Stewart Falconer, Alyth.SCHOOL LIFE WAS JUST PANTSHOW things have changed from my time at a single-sex girls school from  to . I was reminded of what it was like when I saw the photo of the young ladies of St Columbas High School sanitising their handsI am afraid it wasnt the parents problem that interested me but whether the young ladies have to wear school knickers as \"Victorian\" as the ones in my day. I doubt it, as those pupils would probably not agree to wear the near-bloomers with strong elastic which were de rigueur. We had bottle-green oneswith a small pocket in which to keep ones handkerchief.The unorms we wore were tunics which came to the knee until, joy of joys, in the sixth form we were allowed to progress to skirts which came to near the ankles. It was the time of the \"new look\" so we felt very fashionable. I still wear skirts at ankle- and never trousers though I have given up on voluminous knickers with pockets.Thelma Edwards, Kelso.BOND WONT SAVE CINEMAWITH reference to the article by Karen Peattie film will be good for our economy\", The Herald, October  it will take more than one Bond movie to revive cinema attendance.As a regular cinema attender prior to Covid my attendance has declined signicantly since restrictions eased.

However, head coach Mike Blair believes that all four of the South African sides which have joined the league this year are getting stronger as they become accustomed to playing in European conditions, so has warned his team that they canrsquot afford to start slowly.ldquoTheyrsquore used to the type of game over here now with two games under their belts, Blair reasoned. ldquoStormers had an excellent first  minutes or so against Munster and not many teams go there and are  points up near half-time.ldquoMunster got back into it through their driving game, but Stormers when they hit their straps are a dficult team to stop.Blair added that while Edinburgh wonrsquot underestimate the challenge they face this coming weekend, the team will approach the match with confidence having quickly compartmentalised their loss to Benetton.ldquoWe had a team meeting and were frustrated, he explained. ldquoWe talked about shooting ourselves in the foot. But there was a load of positive stuff too, so it was a positive meeting about the good things that wersquove been doing.ldquoBut we did also reflect on the fact that we canrsquot give the opposition easy ins to the game through our basic errors, whether thatrsquos discipline or skill-based stuff.ldquoAfter  minutes we kicked the ball out on the full, and on  minutes  second wersquove got a line-out on their  to win the game, so you look back and of course yoursquore frustrated with how it turned out. But, as I said to the guys, itrsquos not asthese are dficult things to fix. We can turn these things around pretty quickly.ldquoThey were six wins from seven, playing at home, sowe had won that game that would have gone down as a really good away victory, he added. ldquoWe canrsquot then turn around and say it was a shocking loss.One of the big success stories for Edinburgh so far this season has been the form of Ben Vellacott, the -year-old scrum-half who joined the club from Wasps during the summer and has added an energy to the capital outfitrsquos play which was conspicuously absent last season under Richard Cockerill.Vellacottrsquos recruitment may have happened before Blair took up the capital reins, but the coach has been a long-time admirer.ldquoHersquos done well, hasnrsquot he  said Blair. ldquoHersquos someone we watched nationally for a few seasons. He had a bad knee injury [in September ] and didnrsquot get a huge amount of rugby after that. I was in touch with him a couple of years ago and gave him a bit of feedback on a few dferent things.ldquoHersquos an exceptional player. Give him front foot ball and hersquos going to tear the opposition apart. And the pleasing thing with Ben is hersquos not been a one-trick pony. Hersquos been able to play at tempo. but hersquos shown a really good organisation as well.As the nationrsquos most capped scrum-half and a former member of Gregor Townsendrsquos Scotland coaching team, Blair is ideally placed to assess whether the new man has got what it takes to push his way into the international frame this autumn.ldquoI think Scotland have strong scrum-halves, and George [Horne] and Ali [Price] probably have a fair bit in the bank, but the way that Ben is going,he can continue to show this consistency, hersquoll start pushing those two along with Jamie Dobie and Scott Steele, Blair said.Vellacottrsquos fine form has not been good news for the two other scrum-halves in the Edinburgh squad, with -year-old Henry Pyrgos managing eight minutes off the bench in round one against the Scarlets and -year-old Charlie Shiel being an unused sub against Benetton.This lack of game time is a particular concern with respect to Shiel, who has been on the books since the summer of  and has  appearances to his name, but only  starts.

Proposals also include “active travel” routes, e-bike chargers and welcome facilities, alongside coach permits and charging at some car parks.The programme is being funded with joint investment of up to £. million from the Scottish Government and UK Government, as part of the Islands Growth Deal — a ten-year investment programme jointly funded by the UK and Scottish governments, the three island councils and their partners from the public, academic and business sectors.During the in-person sessions, due to take place next Tuesday and Wednesday, attendees will be guided through proposals with representatives from project partners.OIC leader, Councillor James Stockan, said: “The Islands Deal commitment we have from the Scottish and UK Governments to support the Orkney Gateway is hugely gratying and reflects the position our World Heritage Site holds as one of the jewels in Scotland’s and indeed the UK’s tourism crown — not to mention the global archaeological signicance of the site.“But we must remember that at the core of this is a landscape and series of monuments which for many Orcadians is a direct, mysterious and powerful link to their past. And we know equally they are held very dear by people who’ve moved into these islands over the years.“So, as partners, we are all very clear that we want to gather local people’s views on the range of options that we could bid for through our final Islands Deal business case.”The consultation events are scheduled for Tuesday, October , at Maeshowe Visitor Centre, Stenness, from pm to pm, and Wednesday, October , at St Magnus Centre, Kirkwall, from pm until pm.If you’re unable to attend these events, further information is available at www.orkney.gov.uk orkneygateway.

This includes Memorandums of Understanding with Orkney Harbour Authority and Scrabster Harbour Trust to enhance port infrastructure and position the area more competitively to support offshore wind projects in the future.The announcement of this bid comes after the completion of the leasing round of Scotwind, a programme which will lease areas of the seabed around Scotland for wind farm developments.The Scottish Government hopes that as much as ten gigawatts of new generating capacity will be built over the next decade.Stephen Kerr, project director of the West of Orkney Windfarm, said: “While ScotWind has created the opportunity for a global industry to tap into Europe’s best wind resource, our consortium believes that success will be driven by targeted proposals built upon strong local relationships.”We have designed our bid specically around this location and brought together a unique combination of stakeholders to maximise the opportunities for the region.“In particular, the upcoming round of offshore wind projects are a terric opportunity for ports in Caithness and Orkney to win signicant long-term contracts in the installation and operational phase of these major infrastructure schemes.“Our agreements with Scrabster Harbour Trust and Orkney Harbour Authority will enable us to work together with a clear focus on long term delivery. Each port has its own specic capabilities and attributes, and on successful site award we have committed to fund collaborative design and supply studies and to invest where appropriate in improving each harbour’s infrastructure.“We will apply a similar collaborative approach across the supply chain, working closely with Scottish and UK suppliers to deliver on climate targets and enhance local economies.”The consortium has undertaken extensive site investigations, including birds, marine mammals and near-shore geophysical surveys, and has finalised a grid connection agreement with National Grid that will enable the project to commence generation in .Jim Buck, harbourmaster for Orkney Harbour Authority, said that Scapa Flow # the second largest natural harbour in the world # offers an environment like no other and said that the £million masterplan to develop ports around Orkney is key in attracting new business to the islands. “Our Masterplan embraces decarbonisation and a transition away from fossil fuels,” said Mr Buck.“It includes a range of infrastructure enhancements across key locations around the Orkney mainland, including a new deep-water facility in Scapa Flow, which will be crucial to us realising our ambition to deliver social and economic benefit from offshore wind energy.“The West of Orkney Windfarm is ideally positioned to make signicant use of these future facilities and this collaboration represents another key step on our journey to position Orkney as a base for innovation and a major contributor in delivering a carbon-free future for the islands.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4108705.jpg--.jpg?1632478259000\n","title":"craigdun bids fond farewell to wilma","story":"CRAIGDUN Private Nursing Home in Cullybackey has bid a fond farewell to Wilma Swann who retired recently after  years of dedicated employment.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.

Mohamed said he will now be altering the logo out of respect for the city he loves and has made his home, despite it having been associated with the Maiden Heaven name for more than a decade.“I know it’s weird situation but people in Derry know and know well that this wasn’t intentional,” he told the Belfast .“It’s not an issue for me. I’m just going change the colour and logo a bit as a matter of respect to my community and families in the city.”The logo, which uses angel wings either side of an ice-cream cone, was launched by the brand back in .The Parachute Regiment logo, which has been the cause of protests in Northern Ireland, also uses similar wings, but Mohamed feels it’s a recent change to a red background that has made the similarity more pronounced.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The Regiment’s insignia has been particularly contentious around Derry, having been displayed on lampposts in loyalist areas in support of troops involved in Bloody Sunday in . It’s often burned on republican bonfires in protest at the soldiers’ actions, who many believe should be held accountable for killing  innocent civilians in the city that January, with another man dying from his injuries months later.The issues came to a head again when ‘Soldier F’ was charged with murder on Bloody Sunday. Regimental banners in support of the paratrooper were erected in towns around Northern Ireland.And at an Apprentice Boys of Derry parade in , the Clyde Valley Flute Band caused controversy when they marched through the city wearing the regimental insignia with the letter F underneath — in reference to the soldier who was charged with murder and attempted murder on Bloody Sunday.However, relatives of those killed were then informed by the Public Prosecution Service in July this year that any evidence gathered would be inadmissible in court and that a trial would not be proceeding. The matter has gone to judicial review.It’s only now that some people have made Mohamed aware of the shop’s logo, with the design added to by a dark red background when new premises were opened in August this year.The owner said “concerned good friends” had pointed out the similarity in the logos, and added he believes it was the change in background colour which brought it to some people’s attention.“The logo has been there for over  years,” he said.Posting on social media, Mohamed added: “It has been brought to my attention over the last few days by a few good friends that the logo for Maiden Heaven coffee shop and ice cream bears a striking resemblance to the Parachute Regiment insignia.“Given the history of this city and the fact that the Parachute Regiment shot dead innocent people on the streets of Derry, I would never have knowingly used a logo that would offend or hurt the people of this city that I love and the city that has been my home over the last  years.“And sorryanyone was offended by this logo and colour, I would never have used it to promote my business had I realised the similarity.“I’m guessing it’s the colour that has brought this to some people’s attention,” he said.Mohamed has been inundated with messages of support following his decision to amend his logo, with some saying the businessman has nothing to apologise for and others praising him for his decision to amend the logo.

First of all, we need the commitment of the Northern Ireland Executive to fund the NI side of the project, and secondly the frequency of the DART means that every Enterprise train has to crawl through the Dublin suburbs at very low speeds.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has welcomed the plan announced by the Irish Government adding that she has “huge ambitions” for rail network across the island of Ireland. Ms Mallon added that a joint rail review with the Irish Government will expand on previous commitments under the New Decade, New Approach agreement to examine the feasibility of a high speed rail link between Belfast, Dublin and Cork by now including Derry and Limerick.“There are real opportunities for communities across Ireland and signicant benefits that a better connected island could bring not just to people but also for our economy and environment,” she said.The plan also includes the creation of an island-wide greenway network which links the Atlantic coast with the Eastern seaboard through greenway projects across the border region. It also pledges the continuation of two previously-announced projects the Ulster Canal restoration and the Narrow Water bridge.SDLP Upper Bann MLA Dolores Kelly said that the plan is “an ambitious programme with the potential to deliver real change for communities North and South.”Alliance MLA Andrew Muir said that added investment and a more frequent train service linking Belfast and Dublin is “warmly welcomed”.“A high quality, frequent and attractive rail service to rival and tempt people off the road is essential as we seek to re-build a greener more sustainable future,” he said.Co Down man Gareth Carville has been travelling from Crossgar to Dublin for work for the past  years, from Monday to Friday, by road.He said that the new hourly train service would help with the extreme traffic congestion in Dublin City Centre witnessed most days.“During lockdown I could get from my home in Crossgar to Dublin in an hour and  minutes. Now it’s back to the traffic levels pre-pandemic, worse even,” he told Belfast .“My commute could take anything up to two and a half hours each day and in the mornings the M is like the biggest car park in Dublin.”Gareth said that he would normally travel on holiday with his family and suggested that an added stop-off near the airport would be beneficial to include in the new service.“The price of parking at Dublin airport is extortionate and even though you save by taking the train down you still have to get a taxi across, so most people opt for the bus,” he said.“If the hourly train had an added stop at the airport there would be more people willing to use the service.”Earlier this year, the chief executive of Translink said that the existing fleet of trains, which first went into service in , only have between five to  years left.Chris Conway said back in April: We really need to get procurement under way for a new fleet on the Enterprise in the next three to four years. That would allow us to move to an hourly frequency service on the Belfast to Dublin network.What people always want is to get into Dublin and Belfast earlier in the morning. With a new fleet we could do that.Before the Covid- pandemic, there were four trains operating eight services a day in each direction between the two cities, but there were complaints about the lack of early morning services..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsAndrew MuirDepartment for InfrastructureNichola MallonSDLPDolores KellyMore On Andrew Muir PremiumLisburn and Castlereagh lead way in pothole claims‘Disgraceful’ charging infrastructure in Northern Ireland is putting people off electric vehicles PremiumTranslink facing a loss of £m as it plans Glider route expansion PremiumGreat escapes ...where our politicians are going for a staycation PremiumNI Executive talks as Brexit and coronavirus cause construction delays and costs skyrocket Most ReadDerry ice-cream parlour boss apologises for logo’s ‘striking resemblance’ to Parachute Regiment insigniaShould I call in twice  BBC’s Nolan criticised by ‘Damian from Londonderry’ over Derry policyNorthern Ireland hidden gem is named ‘eccentric hotel of the year’Belfast City Marathon’s up and running…  miles and thousands of smilesNI high street voucher: First , Spend Local cards issued – what to do when it arrivesTop VideosPlayOfficial trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedPlayVideo: Irish farmer not happy with his brother#s tractor driving in hilarious viral YouTube clipPlayVideo: #Frostbit Boy# Ruairi McSorley#s jive dance with Donegal teen goes viralLatest Northern IrelandKenneth Branagh to bring his Belfast film home next month for a star-studded Irish premiereDavid Healy promises wholesale changes on landmark Linfield night against Ards in County Antrim ShieldCltonville for the league title  Why that’s ‘crazy talk’ for manager Paddy McLaughlinThree men arrested in Lyra McKee murder probeBelfast Giants have to take lessons from first loss, warns coach Adam KeefeLatestBelfastIT Awards: Invest NI sponsors Mobile App of YearKenneth Branagh to bring his Belfast film home next month for a star-studded Irish premiereSHS Group’s % revenue jumpBelfast bookshop No Alibis’ charity pledge for voucher useDavid Healy promises wholesale changes on landmark Linfield night against Ards in County Antrim Shield,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But I think, ultimately, is for us to decide and sort out with the EU as we wish, and nobody would expect anything dferent really I think.Lord Frost made the comments during an event at the Tory conference in Manchester on Monday.He was responding to an intervention by Mr Biden last month, when the President warned Prime Minister Boris Johnson not to renege on treaties preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.At the time the President warned that the US had spent an enormous amount of time and effort on the peace process.At the weekend, Secretary of State Brandon Lewis said the government believe the “conditions have been met” to trigger Article  as part of the Northern Ireland Protocol.The post-Brexit trading agreement is the means by which a hard border is avoided on the island of Ireland.It sees Northern Ireland continue to follow certain EU rules on goods, and thus it creates a de facto sea border with GB, which has angered unionists.Article  has been described as an “emergency brake” which allows either side to take unilateral actionthe protocol is causing “serious economic, societal or environmental dficulties that are liable to persist”, or ersion of trade.The suspension of key parts of the Brexit treaty with the triggering of Article  could potentially see a hard border emerge.On  September Mr Biden told media at the White House during a UK visit that that he felt very strongly about the issue.We spent an enormous amount of time and effort, the United States, it was a major bipartisan effort made, he told the media.I would not at all like to see, nor I might add would many of my Republican colleagues like to see, a change in the Irish accords, the end result having a closed border in Ireland.During his remarks at the fringe event in Manchester, Lord Frost told those attending that the UK “cannot wait for ever” for a response from the EU to calls for renegotiation.“Without an agreed solution soon, we will need to act, using the Article  safeguard mechanism, to address the impact the protocol is having on Northern Ireland,” he said.“That may in the end be the only way to protect our country – our people, our trade, our territorial integrity, the peace process, and the benefits of this great UK of which we are all part.”European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic said in July: “We will not agree to a renegotiation of the protocol. Respecting international legal obligations is of paramount importance.” The EU position is yet to sht on the issue.Asked about Lord Frost#s speech, a European Commission spokesperson told reporters in Brussels on Monday: You will not be surprised to hear that we do not comment on the sayings or the statements of our partners or any stakeholders, whatever nature they have and however lyrical or aggressive they may be. We are not going to depart from that position in these specic circumstances at all.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry Court: Lyra McKee accused gets bail overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filmingDerry NewsLets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filming overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Conor Kelly scored - in Kevin Lynchs win over Banagher.GAADERRY GAA: Kevin Lynchs book their place in senior hurling final with win over Banagher overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPublic warned Altnagelvin AE very busy and only attend in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Reporter: Michael McMullan Oct   addthis, In this weekends intermediate championship schedule, its all about getting eight teams down to four ahead of the quarter-finals later this month. Limavady v BallymaguiganThursday- OwenbegReferee: Kieran OConnor The first game of this this weekends action is a repeat of last years clash at the same stage when Limavady were convincing winners to knock Ballymaguigan out of the championship.When the sides met in last months group stages, it was a gripping contest won by Sheagh McLaughlins late thunderbolt to the top corner of the Quigan net, as a Cormac Quigley inspired Limavady came out winners again.Ballymaguigan lost out to Lissan and played second fiddle to Steelstowns blue wave in their final game.Daniel Bradley should be back this weekend after missing the game with illness.Michael Spiers made himself an outlet in attack and Shea Bradley battled well at midfield, but they will need another big performance this week.Limavady should have Oran Hartin back between the posts this weekend after John Deighans cameo in the last round. Karl Diamond and Fabian Muldoon will hope that Conor Boyd is fully fit to start after his substitute appearance against Lissan. His bravery, use of the ball and positional sense will bring stability to their defence. Not to mention his experience.Theyll have to keep an eye on Paudie Martin in attack after his three goals in as many games. It will be interesting to seeCiaran McIvor and Darren Conway are included from the start, or kept in reserve for when the game opens up.Limavady won the sweeper battle, with Kieran McGlinchey imposing himself on their counter-attacking game, with Tomaacutes Brady overworked and being the third marker Cormac Quigley went through on the night.Thursday will be about whoever can make the wide open spaces their friend and the Wolfhounds may be better equipped and their goal threat could see them into the last eight.VERDICT: Limavady googletag.cmd.push Glenullin v SlaughtmanusFriday- Celtic ParkReferee: Gregory McWilliams Glenullins inconsistent season arrives at the final fork in the road on Friday night at Owenbeg as Liam Bradleys side put their championship cards of the table. There are no more chances. This is championship as we know it and standing in their way is a Slaughtmanus side they defeatedfive weeks ago in the group stages.The Glens narrow defeat at the hands of Castledawson was followed by a disappointing performance at Faughanvale, a game they never got to grips with.In the absence of Eoin Bradley, their young guns of Fearghal Close and Michael Oacuteg McKeown asked a lot of Castledawsons defence, with Neil McNicholl also a welcome . This week will be about getting the pieces to fit together alongside Skinner and Dermot OKane.The Glen have found an excellent keeper in Sean McKinney, behind a defence backboned by the OKanes. Ronan Close, Traglach Bradley and Brian Mullan will provide their midfield spine.Slaughtmanus could again be without Conor McGee, Gavin McShane and Eoghan Cassidy, but the have still been able to create chances. All they need is a day when their threat clicks and the net is bulging rather than another day of regrets and head scratching. Their clash with the Vale wouldve been oh so dferent had they taken even one of their goal chances when they trailed - to -.Goalkeeper Conor Thornton has , but theyll nee to maximise their output from Caolan Hargan and Killian Thornton up front, with Kyle Gallagher pulling the pieces together.A tight game in prospect, with Bakers side to come through.VERDICT: Glenullin Lissan v GlackSaturday– GlenReferee: Dan Mullan Two years ago, Glack were in flying form on their way to the junior title, but have since lost their mojo and have trudged their way though the season in Division .Lissan, while playing in a higher ision, failed to win a game, but they gave plenty of teams trouble. Their one-point defeat early in the season to eventual champions Drumsurn showed the promise they have.Former Derry minor captain Iarlaith Donaghy has been their consisitent cog all season and he kicked four points in their defeat at the hands of Limavady.They will take confidence from their win over Ballymaguigan into Saturdays trip to Glen.Glack have good performances from Ryan OKane, Martin McGonigle, Ryan Morgan and Adam OKane for much of the season. Adrian McGilligans side had the league win over Ballerin, in which they denied the Sarsfields the title, as a sign of they can do. But with too much reliance on Niall McGOwan for scores, it leaves Lissan with a target – stop him and they could repeat their  season and nip a spot in the Quarter-FinalsVERDICT: Lissan     Castledawson v Doire TrasnaSaturday– DungivenReferee: TBCA team we know much about and will be contenders for the biggest prize on offer next month against Doire Trasna who havent got going. Literally.Their two concessions against Greenlough and Drumsurn raised a few eyebrows across the county. Covid, players away at college and injuries combined into their reasoning for not fielding. It leaves them totally undercooked for a game theyd have been facing an uphill battle with even their full compliment of players.Eoghan Quigg, Micheaacutel McNaught and Colin Murray have been their key men in attack in recent times, with Tomaacutes McCrossan their anchor in defence and Paul Quigley at midfield.In recent times their management duo have had to get the boots on and their lack of collective training doesnt bode well ahead or Saturdays encounter.Dawson manager Niall Jackman admits to using the league to blood new players, with the view of drawing up a side later in the season. Players like Niall Rafferty in their defence. And that time is now.They can count themselves unlucky not to get something out of their group game against the Vale at home and they dug deep to see off Glenullin.Theof Niall Keenan has been a welcome addition and Niall McNicholl is in the form of his le, having got himself into great nick. Jackman will have to guard against complacency, but its hard to make a case for anything other than a Castledawson win.

It leaves them totally undercooked for a game theyd have been facing an uphill battle with even their full compliment of players.Eoghan Quigg, Micheaacutel McNaught and Colin Murray have been their key men in attack in recent times, with Tomaacutes McCrossan their anchor in defence and Paul Quigley at midfield.In recent times their management duo have had to get the boots on and their lack of collective training doesnt bode well ahead or Saturdays encounter.Dawson manager Niall Jackman admits to using the league to blood new players, with the view of drawing up a side later in the season. Players like Niall Rafferty in their defence. And that time is now.They can count themselves unlucky not to get something out of their group game against the Vale at home and they dug deep to see off Glenullin.Theof Niall Keenan has been a welcome addition and Niall McNicholl is in the form of his le, having got himself into great nick. Jackman will have to guard against complacency, but its hard to make a case for anything other than a Castledawson win.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. googletag.cmd.push NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”      CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

In an emotional and truly moving interview with Miriam O’Callaghan on RTEacute Radio  on Sunday, Geraldine Mullan said she was ultimately grateful to have survived the crash in which her family drowned as it allowed her to say goodbye to her husband and two children and to work to keep their memories alive. googletag.cmd.push In August , Geraldine’s husband Johnand her children Tomaacutesand Ameliadied when the family’s car plunged into Lough Foyle at Quigley’s Point on their way home from a family day out. She described the days before the tragedy, the aftermath and the steps she had taken to honour the memory of her family. Thereports on how the oncology nurse said she looked back at the early part of last year’s Covid lockdown when she was off work with a back injury and her husband’s garden centre was closed as “precious family time”. “It was simple things like a sleepover in the back garden or movie time or during our lovely coastal walk along the shore path… precious time with my beloved three”. Geraldine said on the day of the crash she and her husband were both off work and had planned a day outdoors but the weather was bad in the wake of Storm Ellen so the family had gone to Derry for bowling, a trip to the cinema and dinner instead. “It was just a lovely day out, we watched the Snow Queen and got the iniable popcorn and ice cream and then we did the bowling and then we had dinner.     She said she has “beautul memories” of the family, laughing and joking and planning what they were going to do for the rest of their family time. The crash happened on their way home. “I would have heard that saying that your le can change in a second and unfortunately for me on that night of August th, my le changed forever. It was the perfect storm, everything went against us and unfortunately I was the only one that ... managed to survive.” She said when the emergency services did reach the car, they held on to her. “I will admit there was a time I didn’t want [them] to hold on to me because I knew I’d lost everything. I knew by the time help came that unfortunately it wasn’t going to be a rescue, it was just going to be a search for John, Tomaacutes and Amelia. So at one point I just asked him to ‘let me go’.” She said the rescue worker apologised and said: “Geraldine, I can’t let you go.” She praised “the valiant efforts of every single one of those emergency service [who] put their lives at risk and worked tremendously hard and found my beloved three so I could bring them home and I could say goodbye to them. “I got to see my beloved family one last time and I got to bring them home, to have my couple of nights at home with them before the funeral on the Monday and before I said goodbye to them.” She said now she was focused on trying “to keep doing the best I can for John, Thomas and Amelia. … they were just so full of love and le and unfortunately all their lives were cut short abruptly on that night.” She said when Thomas and Amelia were found, the boy was holding his baby sister. “He was the kindest, gentle boy.

In it, Burke accuses Kitson of the following: “Had he set out to become a recruitment sergeant for the IRA, he could not have done a better job”. googletag.cmd.push A cynic might say that such an accusation can only be made in hindsight but voices at the time during the early s were saying it as well. One such voice was Stormont Parliament MP, Paddy Devlin of the SDLP, who wrote that Kitson “did more than any other inidual to sour relations between the Catholic community and the security forces”. Burkes book reveals how the tragic events of Bloody Sunday was not a case, of a few troops being out of control but the culmination of a number of poor, ill-formed decisions that had its roots in the British armys counter-insurgency techniques employed in their then-colonies of Malaya, Kenya and Aden. Such techniques also involved many incidences of torture used by the army – something that would visit Derry and the rest of the north of Ireland when Kitson arrived. The Savile Report of  vindicated the victims and those attending the Civil Rights march on that fateful Sunday in  but neither General Kitson or his elite troops were held accountable. Burke, a Dublin-based barrister who is also the son of Richard Burke – the Education Minister in Liam Cosgraves Fine Gael government, attempts to set the record straight regarding Kitsons involvement and how his tactics during his time in the north of Ireland spiralled into the murder of  civil rights marchers in Derry.     “I tried to write the book in a way thats not overly academic,” said Burke, but there are footnotes there to show my research and to back up what has been written. “It wasnt written for an audience who had not known anything previously about the subject matter but for people who are interested in what happened in the north in  and . “I wrote a book last year, which was called Deception and Lies: The Hidden History of the  Arms Crisis, One of the themes of that book was why The Troubles started. “In that I pointed out that in the mid-s, the IRA had all but laid down their guns. There was a rapprochement opportunity between the government in the Republic of Ireland and the Stormont Government in the North. “That had sparked militant responses from people like Ian Paisley and they had turned up the heat and they had created by  violence and inter-communal fighting. “In that context this book is a continuation of the previous one in that it looks as why did it go wrong, why did you have a situation where British soldiers came and they did a fantastic, really honourable job and they were rightly and correctly welcomed with cups of tea and sandwiches during the so-called honeymoon period. “You can imagine back in  being an  to -year-old soldier and being invited in on Christmas Day to join families. There was a good relationship there. “So this book looks at why all that went wrong. I quote Paddy Devlin in it where hes critical of the IRA – the Provisionals in particular – for turning up the heat. Then there was the rioting which was unfortunately part of the deterioration. And then there was the change of government . “One other factor was the arrived of Kitson and Kitsons career in the colonies had always been about counter-insurgency. He was, as I say in the book, the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time. “In fairness to him, he did try the hearts and minds approach at first but then the Provisional IRA didnt want that co-operation. So very quickly, Kitson reverts to his counter-insurgency technique. Documents from  show that they took the decision to take the war to the IRA. They decided not to try to suppress the violence of the Loyalists – later on, of course, there is collusion with those groups. “All of this is aggrevated by the Ballymurphy Massacre and then of course, Bloody Sunday. My conclusion is that Kitsons heavy-handed tactics and the heavy-handed behaviour of the paratroopers in particular, played into the hands of the IRA.” One such tactic was for Kitson and his staff to rely heavily on accounts given by so-called men-on-the-ground who came off as being in the know but turned out to be fantasists. Observer B was an agent of both British Military Intelligence and MI who had access to the no-go area of Derry back in . This character continually fabricated information that he constantly fed to his handlers – one included the report of an imaginary IRA battalion supposedly conducting a paramilitary drill in practice for a big operation on January , , the day of the Civil Rights march that was brutally ended by Bloody Sunday. Burke continued: “When I looked at Bloody Sunday, it was like being given the parts of a watch and having to put it altogether. I came to the only conclusion I could come to in that Observer Bs information was kept within a very tight circle and it wasnt tested. “Had it been given to the likes of RUC InspectorLagan then maybe he might have been able to point out the inaccuracies of some of Observer Bs ridiculous claims. “But this information from Observer B was going through his handlers who dont know what Derrys like and dont understand it and hes their source of information as theyre not relying on anyone . Its from there a catastrophe begins to unfold and becomes understandable.” The Saville Report has been presented as the final denouement on what happened on Bloody Sunday but Burke says questions still remain to be answered. He added: “Their activities have been hidden from the ordinary person in Britain. Theres a darkness in Whitehall which has a knee-jerk reaction, every time when something like this happens, to cover it up. “Im a barrister and I know thatSaville is entitled to come to the conclusion that the soldiers were out of control. I respectfully disagree with him. I think theres another interpretation of it. “The book points out that there is something much more deeper going on here.” “Kitsons Irish War: Mastermind Of The Dirty War In Ireland” by David Bourke is published by Mercier Press and is out now.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication. Being part of the Volkswagen Group means that Cupra has access to cutting-edge mechanicals and technology, and this has enabled the new Formentor compact SUV to hit the ground running, so to speak.  googletag.cmd.push   There is a lot of money and confidence behind the Cupra brand, and that is evident in the bold product plan promised by the company.Engine  Trim OptionsThe Formentor sits on the familiar MQB set of chassis components that also underpins other crossovers such as the Seat Ateca and VW Tiguan. Petrol engine options in the Formentor consist of a .-litre TSI with bhp and a .-litre TSI unit with a choice of ,  or bhp. The . TSI engine is available as a -speed manual or -speed DSG , while the . TSI comes with a DSG transmission as standard, with Cupra’s Drivesystem standard in bhp guise. A . TDIEVO engine is available with bhp and can be mated to a -speed manual or -speed DSG transmission, with the latter coming with Drive as standard.     Additionally, a .-litre e-Hybrid powertrain is available with a choice of bhp or bhp, both of which are mated to a -speed DSG transmission with promised fuel consumption as low as .l km on a combined WLTP driving cycle.There is a choice of two trim levels in CUPRA’s new compact SUV — Formentor and Formentor VZ — with the latter being the Cupra Formentor’s most powerful trim, named in reference to the Spanish word ‘Veloz’, meaning ‘fast’.The Formentor VZ trim offers high-performance powertrain options. Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall.

The news that the Dundalk man has signed a pre-contract agreement with his home town club, after  years away, has been met with great excitement by Derry City fans, with the -year-old agreeing a four-year deal at the Brandywell. googletag.cmd.push Now that excitement is being shared by McEleney, who has also agreed tohome next year, meaning he will reunite with his long-time friend and team mate in red and white. “He’s obviously an amazing player,” he said. “I’ve played with him now for six or seven seasons I think and I know what he’s capable of. It’s an amazing signing for Derry. A lot of credit has to go to Derry and to Ruaidhriand Philipfor getting it over the line. He has been the best probably in the league for two or three years running so hopefully he can continue that form.” The two Derry men have done it all at Dundalk in recent years, but McEleney admits that the two soon-to-be Derry City players have often wondered what it would be like to achieve similar success with the team they grew up with. “We have spoken about it before,” he admitted. “Down there I think we’ve won three league titles and FAI Cups and we’ve been in the Europa League and we’ve always said ‘Imagine doing it for Derry’. I think Mickey has said that it is what he wants to do. “We are Derry men and obviously supporters of the club. I used to go to the Brandywell to watch Derry and I had a season ticket for six years on the run. It won’t be weird, we’re just excited by it and really looking forward to it.”     These are exciting times for Derry City with Ruaidhri Higgins determined to bring success back to the Brandywell, and McEleney is adamant that he wants to be a part of it. “Ruaidhri was a big pull,” he added. “I’ve played long with him and he was my assistant at Dundalk and I know what he’s about. I’m just really looking forward to coming back. Mickey is one of my best mates so we speak about kit all the time and he’s the exact same. We just want to do really well and bring trophies back. We’re not coming up to put our feet up, we’re coming up to win trophies.”  ‘Better team won Meanwhile, City boss Ruaidhri Higgins has admitted that the better team won after watching his team fall to their first defeat in  league games with the - loss at Shamrock Rovers on Friday. City took an early lead through Danny Lafferty, but the champions hit back through goals from lee Grace and Danny Mandriou to claim the three points. “The best team won,” he said. “We got ourselves in front with a really good goal early on, but Rovers got a foothold in the game. We were probably a minute away from getting in at half time and regrouping but they have punished us. “Our players have been brilliant. They have had a lot of praise and pats on the back and rightly so but I think we didn’t reach the levels that we can get to. In key moments in the game we lacked a wee bit of belief and I think we showed naivety and we got punished for it. “We lost our composure and our first pass when we won the ball back let us down. We’ve had a couple of half chances Alan Mannus has made an unbelievable save from Ronan Boyce to stop us going - up, but I can’t have any complaints about the result.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry Court: Lyra McKee accused gets bail overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filmingDerry NewsLets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filming overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Conor Kelly scored - in Kevin Lynchs win over Banagher.GAADERRY GAA: Kevin Lynchs book their place in senior hurling final with win over Banagher overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPublic warned Altnagelvin AE very busy and only attend in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The news that the Dundalk man has signed a pre-contract agreement with his home town club, after  years away, has been met with great excitement by Derry City fans, with the -year-old agreeing a four-year deal at the Brandywell. googletag.cmd.push Now that excitement is being shared by McEleney, who has also agreed tohome next year, meaning he will reunite with his long-time friend and team mate in red and white. “He’s obviously an amazing player,” he said. “I’ve played with him now for six or seven seasons I think and I know what he’s capable of. It’s an amazing signing for Derry. A lot of credit has to go to Derry and to Ruaidhriand Philipfor getting it over the line. He has been the best probably in the league for two or three years running so hopefully he can continue that form.” The two Derry men have done it all at Dundalk in recent years, but McEleney admits that the two soon-to-be Derry City players have often wondered what it would be like to achieve similar success with the team they grew up with. “We have spoken about it before,” he admitted. “Down there I think we’ve won three league titles and FAI Cups and we’ve been in the Europa League and we’ve always said ‘Imagine doing it for Derry’. I think Mickey has said that it is what he wants to do. “We are Derry men and obviously supporters of the club. I used to go to the Brandywell to watch Derry and I had a season ticket for six years on the run. It won’t be weird, we’re just excited by it and really looking forward to it.”     These are exciting times for Derry City with Ruaidhri Higgins determined to bring success back to the Brandywell, and McEleney is adamant that he wants to be a part of it. “Ruaidhri was a big pull,” he added. “I’ve played long with him and he was my assistant at Dundalk and I know what he’s about. I’m just really looking forward to coming back. Mickey is one of my best mates so we speak about kit all the time and he’s the exact same. We just want to do really well and bring trophies back. We’re not coming up to put our feet up, we’re coming up to win trophies.”  ‘Better team won Meanwhile, City boss Ruaidhri Higgins has admitted that the better team won after watching his team fall to their first defeat in  league games with the - loss at Shamrock Rovers on Friday. City took an early lead through Danny Lafferty, but the champions hit back through goals from lee Grace and Danny Mandriou to claim the three points. “The best team won,” he said. “We got ourselves in front with a really good goal early on, but Rovers got a foothold in the game. We were probably a minute away from getting in at half time and regrouping but they have punished us. “Our players have been brilliant. They have had a lot of praise and pats on the back and rightly so but I think we didn’t reach the levels that we can get to. In key moments in the game we lacked a wee bit of belief and I think we showed naivety and we got punished for it. “We lost our composure and our first pass when we won the ball back let us down. We’ve had a couple of half chances Alan Mannus has made an unbelievable save from Ronan Boyce to stop us going - up, but I can’t have any complaints about the result.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry Court: Lyra McKee accused gets bail overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filmingDerry NewsLets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filming overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Conor Kelly scored - in Kevin Lynchs win over Banagher.GAADERRY GAA: Kevin Lynchs book their place in senior hurling final with win over Banagher overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPublic warned Altnagelvin AE very busy and only attend in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

No Oil Paintings are a rowdy Americana four piece from Belfast. What am I doing writing about a Belfast band when all I do is slag them normally  They do have some good bands and even some great ones and besides most of the funding was gone before anyone  had filled their application. googletag.cmd.push Where was I  Their mix of folk instrumentation, four-part harmonies and high energy live shows serves to create their own brand of genre bending roots music. The band share and switch lead vocals with each member delivering their own style and strength to the songs they bring to the table. Expect to hear everything from swampy blues rock to straight up-country waltzes. What’d you do during the lockdown  “Most importantly we finished recording our debut album, but when we weren’t focused on that we just tried to keep creative. “We recorded live sessions, performed live streams, made ‘zoom videos’ and set each other writing challenges.” Have you got plans for normality, whatever that is, s  “Release the album out into the world. “ We’ve a few more singles to put out before releasing next year, so we’re concentrating on those and trying to book a tour to coincide with that.” Do you like any local musicians andso, who do you like  “We have loads of incredible friends that are part of the music scene here and there really is too much talent to choose from. We’re all fans of The Bonnevilles, Joshua Burnside, Joel Harkin, Laytha, Dani Larkin - The list could go on forever.”     Are there any valuable people, places, organisations to musicians anymore  “There is a huge lack of infrastructure within the music scene in the North, however the people that are here to help do a fantastic job of it. Help Musicians N.I helped fund a lot of the cost of our album through their ‘Do It Dferently’ fund. Places like the Oh Yeah Centre, The Nerve Centre, and how they influence the younger generations as well as nurture the more experienced performers is a credit to all of them. I think a lot of grass roots venues are incredible throughout the country, but we love The Sunflower Bar and The American they’ve always been good to us - and of course Half Bap Recording Studios where we recorded our album.” How was Stendhal, I’ve seen you there a couple of times now  “We’ve slowly made Stendhal a home from home for ourselves, so it’s always a dream to get up to the farm to play again. August  made it our th time performing in the last six years. We’ve made great friends and amazing memories over that time and will always be there for as long as they’ll have us.” Any misconceptions about the band that you’d like to clear up  “I think a lot of people still have us down as quite a bluegrass   folky band, and over the years we’ve had line-up changes and dferent sounds and styles. I think we’ve settled a lot more now into the Americana Alt-folk genre. “We keep very true to our roots and still write folk songs, but they come with a little more decibel now.” Is the oh yeah of any worth  “Absolutely, the work that Charlotte and the team are doing there is really admirable. We’ve been fortunate to play gigs for them on numerous occasions, most recently at last years ‘Sound of Music’ festival. “They have also helped promote us in the past with their ‘Getting To Know’ series and the ‘Native Music Mart’ they host each year. “Aside from ourselves the work they do with Scratch My Progress, Volume Control, Over The Hill and a long list of other”.Well, that’s me proved wrong. I probably owe them an apology So,the Oh Yeah is so good what’s wrong with Irish music scene  “I think the lack of infrastructure is our only downfall. There is an incredible amount of talent on this island, but we don’t have the private investment needed to be able to export it at the right volume. “Small things that people don’t think about such as tour managers, tour buses, right up to major labels and publishers. “We don’t even have representatives for PRS, MU or PPL.” You can find them at www.nooilpaintings and message them atinfo@nooilpaintings,listen to them at open.spoty artist DAlMAJRiFSuRMgdand soundcloud no-oil-paintings,stalk them at instagram no_oil_paintings and twitter nooilpaintingsand watch them atwww.youtube channel UCmxiPBRaPiDbbJiuA-aqA ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry Court: Lyra McKee accused gets bail overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filmingDerry NewsLets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filming overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Conor Kelly scored - in Kevin Lynchs win over Banagher.GAADERRY GAA: Kevin Lynchs book their place in senior hurling final with win over Banagher overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPublic warned Altnagelvin AE very busy and only attend in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

He is currently renovating a studio on his family land in Donegal, Ireland. He exhibits nationally and internationally, showing at the Dublin Castle, The London Art Fair and the Saatchi Gallery with Cynthia Corbett and the Young Masters Art Prize, the Victoria, and Albert Museum “What is Luxury” with Unknown Fields Division and Toby Smith. Other shows include “GLOBALE: Infosphere” ZKM Museum, Karlsruhe, Germany and Van Abbe-museum, Eindhoven. He was selected to represent Ireland in The Ceramic Context Biennale in Bornholm Art Museum in  He collaborated with Dublin architect Peter Carroll from A architects at The European Culture Centre in Venice May-Nov , participated in the Landmark series with Sky Arts representing Scotland, commissioned by Sky Arts to produce a piece of sculpture in  days. He also has a solo show in Dec-Jan at Stallan-Brand Gallery in Glasgow  Kevin completed a residency at The Irish Culture Centre in Paris in August . Are We Here , a site-based, .-meter-tall sculpture by Kevin Callaghan commissioned by Sky Arts on the occasion of the new series Landmark, explores the notion of utopia and our proximity to it      With an ongoing interest in geometry and the potential for multiple realities, Callaghan invites viewers into a future-minded meditation on hope and potentiality via Are We Here. “Are we here ” It’s a question that suggests we are on a journey, and, in addition to hunger for our destination, conjures hope—hope for real freedom and space to realize our multitude of potentialities. If “here” is not yet utopia, it is at least a space where we might imagine, hope for, and build our future. What local music are you into  “Jonny Delaney, Ryan Vail, Orla, And I got a listen To Kwa Daniels’ new radio show on my way to Belfast airport flying back to Glasgow” Inna Rhythm Apart from the obvious, how have you spent lockdown  “When lockdown started my plans to be in Paris on a residency had clearly changed so I began to work extensively on my brand Condie, so that kept me busy for the first lockdown, The second lockdown was crazy busy, after sky arts asked me to apply for the series Landmark, I was one of  in the UK and Ireland commissioned by them, I set about designing the piece Are We Here with my designer. The built-up to the making of the piece in April was intense, then the piece was made in  days from start to finish with the help of the fabricators Sculpture and Design in Glasgow. there was a slower period in May and June then I was finally off to Paris in July”. What groups or services have helped you  “I have had dferent support over the years, the arts council of Ireland, Business to Arts in Dublin, The Crafts Council of Ireland, The National Sculpture Factory in Cork, Donegal Council, and enterprise board to name a few. Its away a nice feeling to support locally”. How do you feel things will change for musicians in the coming year  “It’s been a really tough time for musicians the last  months. I think it’s still going to be a bit slow for artists to get their regular gigs coming back, but I would hope there will be some great new material coming out, from the complex time you all have just had. And I hope that the younger generation of musicians continue to make and put music out and dont get disheartened by the pandemic”. What are your long-term plans  “My long-term plans are to continue making work for exhibitions and larger commission work. I have been doing it since my time studying in Derry  and I dont intend to stop any time soon. I still like to do a residency somewhere every year, I really want to do one again in China, however, le is pretty busy. I am currently renovating a sheep shed in Barnesmore, Donegal in a new studio on the family land and we plan to develop a Bothy style Glamping site on the land in the near future”.

This is the true story of Bernard Gallagher who became a national celebrity during the early s. Considered Derry’s greatest scammer and conman, Willie John was convicted and jailed more than  times for  pretences, impersonation and theft. Born in  in the Rosemount area of Derry City, Bernard Gallagher moved from place to place in pursuit of money, lodgings, food and drink. He became widely known as ‘Willie John’ when he posed as the long lost son of a widow in his hometown. Eventually it was discovered that Gallagher was in fact not Willie John McGranahan and he served five years in prison for this crime. At a time of widespread poverty and emigration, ‘Willie John’ targeted families in remote areas and his favourite scams involved impersonating a long lost relative and tall tales from overseas. In other elaborate ruses, he took on the guise of an official claiming to bring good news about an inheritance from America. By the early s, his court appearances were sensational affairs with large crowds gathering to catch a glimpse of the infamous ‘Willie John’. He often conducted his own defence, playing to the gallery and sometimes pleading that his case not to be tainted by ‘my former character’. Using newspaper articles from the time, Doacutenall investigates how one man managed to hoax people in Derry, counties Donegal and Tyrone, and further afield in Ireland, Scotland and England. Doacutenall travels to the National Archives in Dublin in search of ‘Willie John’s’ prison records and comes ‘face-to face’ for the first time with the man himself as prison photographs of ‘Willie John’ track his changing appearance as he s again and again to prison over the years. Despite his infamous career and his celebrity status, Doacutenall discovers that ‘Willie John’ spent the last  months of his le in Derry’s poor house and reflects on what drove this man – who made a career out of tricking ordinary people – to act the way he did.Made by Macha Media for BBC Gaeilge, Willie John –RoacutegaireMoacuter Dhoire, airs this evening at:pmonBBC Two Northern Ireland.  googletag.cmd.pushADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry Court: Lyra McKee accused gets bail overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filmingDerry NewsLets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filming overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Conor Kelly scored - in Kevin Lynchs win over Banagher.GAADERRY GAA: Kevin Lynchs book their place in senior hurling final with win over Banagher overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPublic warned Altnagelvin AE very busy and only attend in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

That being said, it is no wonder that our rural communities may feel isolated from our bigger towns and cities, where investment and opportunities are more obvious.Rural isolation is closer to all of us than we realise exploring this topic brought to light my own childhood memories of growing up in the countryside.While I loved my upbringing, I hadnrsquot considered how it was impacted by the fact that I grew up in a rural area. It was through exploring the topic of rural isolation that I realised the social effects it can have on our youth.My own children are growing up in the countryside as well and I can now see how this may impact them socially they are not playing with friends in the evenings like many would in housing developments and built up areas.They are playing with each other in their own garden, similar to my own experience. While I donrsquot think this is a negative thing for my children, due to the volume of social groups and clubs that they participate in, I am now consciously taking opportunities to expose them to a wider iety of social situations, so they do not feel the potential effects of rural isolation.It is clear to see the effects of rural isolation when just recently at a meeting with Translink, the cutting of rural bus routes and services was brought to light. This is another slap in the face to those living in rural areas without access to their own vehicle, especially when considering the climate crisis.I and my fellow councillors and party colleagues are encouraging constituents to use active travel and public transport.Meanwhile, those exact services are being cut removing the option for active travel. This is not good enough.I have conducted a range of investigative meetings to see how groups and organisations within South Down in particular are taking action to prevent rural isolation.I recently met with Nicholas McCrickard, manager of Co Down Rural Community Network, an organisation crucial in combatting rural isolation in South Down as itrsquos an umbrella body set up and managed by community groups in the area for more than  years.The aim of the organisation is to create an inclusive future where all citizens actively participate in local le which stimulates a vibrant society.Nicholas and his team, with the support of community groups, ensure regular outreach to all of the citizens in the area so that they can enhance their own lives through participation with ious organisations. This stimulation is a sure-fire way to combat rural isolation, but the resources need to be available to ensure no one is left behind.I recently visited the offices of Good Morning Down in Downpatrick mdash another vital service many in our community rely on. It is an organisation which regularly makes telephone calls to those facing isolation for a iety of reasons. These calls are a method of friendship building between volunteers and residents of a wide iety of ages.The youngest volunteer in Good Morning Down is in their late s, while the eldest is in their late s. Nearly  years worth of knowledge and experience will be exchanged through these conversations and I walked away from this meeting, feeling truly touched by the dedication of the staff and volunteers.In addition, having met with Womenrsquos Aid in recent days, fresh in my mind are the stories of the impact that living in a rural setting has on many women who are isolated from much of society.Not having that friendly neighbour close by can impact the severity of abusive relationships. Thankfully, we have organisations such as Womenrsquos Aid who recognise this and work every day with women in these situations, but funding, resourcing and legislation is always an issue.These are only a few of the fantastic initiatives that offer support to those in rural communities, however, there are many who are unaware of their operation.I would like to raise awareness of the services available to our rural constituents, to promote inclusivity and encourage a positive approach to mental health and wellbeing. It is extremely important to raise awareness and encourage our rural communities to stop and think about their mental health and to consider how rural isolation may affect them.I would encourage our rural communities to take time out to improve their mental health, normalise discussion around issues of isolation and avail of local mental health services.It is time that Newry, Mourne and Down Council took responsibility and recognise the vital work local groups within our community do for the residents of our district and remember that ratepayers donrsquot just live in our major towns like Downpatrick, but also in rural areas such as the wider Lecale countryside.There needs to be a serious refocusing on service provision in rural areas and a renewed approach to capital investment. We need to stand up for the safety of our rural communities, and protect them from the effects of isolation.

champions Kilcoo managed to successfully overcome neighbours Clonduff and progress to the quarter-finals.Mickey Moranrsquos men will concede they were off the pace at Paacuteirc Esler, but with a number of regular starters set toin time for the next round, the Magpies will surely be a dreaded draw for anyone in the competition.Meanwhile, Aidan Robinsonrsquos Downpatrick dark horses made it two wins from two after defeating Longstone by eight points on Saturday.Downpatrick have made a resounding impact in this yearrsquos Senior Championship thus far after dispatching last yearrsquos runners-up Carryduff in their opener, before following that up with their latest scalp at the weekend.Longstone were entering the tie on a high after defeating Warrenpoint in the first round, who many had claimed would push Kilcoo all the way.Both of Downpatrickrsquos previous opponents, Carryduff and Longstone, will now meet in the third round of the competition where one will progress to the quarters and the other will see their championship title hopes shattered.Carryduff managed to bounce back from their opening round loss with a good win against newly promoted Saul.Last yearrsquos intermediate football champions could be excused for their back-to-back defeats in this seasonrsquos top flight campaign after they were drawn the vastly experienced Burren followed by the Carryduff side.However, Saul now enter the relegation battle and face the possibility of ing to the intermediate ranks that they fought so valiantly to climb out of last year.Joining them in the fight for survival will be Loughinisland who, similarly to their opening round, could not maintain their lead for the full duration of the match as they lost to Mayobridge.The Bridge now face Bredagh in their third round tie, after the Belfast side defeated Castlewellan in their opener but failed to beat Ballyholland to progress to the quarters.Castlewellan will be relieved that their one point victory over Rostrevor at the weekend kept their Championship dreams alive, but they will face stf opposition against Glenn in the qualying round.Also in the depths of relegation are Bryansford, who lost out to Glenn in their opener before they were defeated by Warrenpoint in the second round.In the intermediate action, Liatroim made it two consecutive wins to progress to the quarters after they defeated Darragh Cross by five points.The Cross will now meet Newry Shamrocks via the back door route with nothing other than a win requiredthey are to keep their promotion to the Senior Championship alive.Whereas it was a bitter pill to swallow for Dromara, Bright and St Johnrsquos who all tasted defeat for the second game in a row and now face the dreaded relegation battle.Despite Dromara losing to Saval in their second round, they will feel more disappointed at their opening performance where they should have secured the win over Clann na Banna after leading for long durations of the contest.Simarly, Bright will also be kicking themselves after they blew a nine point lead in their opener against Tullylish before they lost out to St Paulrsquos.St Johnrsquos also had their promotion hopes dashed in heartbreaking fashion after they lost their must-win game against Newry Shamrocks by just one point.In the Junior Championship, Kilclief ensured Teconnaught would remain in the competition for another year after a three point win progressed the red and green side to the next round.Teconnaught lost out to Aughlisnafin in their opener whilst this was Kilcliefrsquos first taste of championship action after they received a bye in the first round.Elsewhere, Ardglass bounced back from their opening round lost to Dundrum with a fantastic win over Aghaderg.All of the

mdash also known locally as Bennettrsquos bridge mdash with Cllr Lewis saying what happened was ldquoidiotic and void of reason and that defacing the historic bridge demonstrated ldquoovert sectarianism.Cllr Lewis said while police may not be able to identy those responsible, he was told that neighbours can.ldquoThe aspiring republican artists should be thoroughly embarrassed by their actions and I only hope that their parents are reading this article, he declared.ldquoThis part of rural South Down suffered heavily as a direct result of IRA terrorism.

This would help ensure that the centre of Strangford does not become a car park which happens regularly.Cllr Enright thanked residents for their support on the traffic issue in Strangford and confirmed that the Stormont department has accepted the traffic tailbacks causes problems and that the issue needs to be addressed.He said officials have allocated a small budget to employ additional staff to ensure that the dedicated ferry queuing area is utilised at peak periods to reduce congestion in the centre of the village.Cllr Boyle agrees that a permanent solution is required to address the queuing issue in Strangford.He continued: ldquoWe must promote tourism to its fullest potential on both sides of Strangford Lough. That means that we need structures in place that maintain a steady flow of traffic through both Strangford and Portaferry.ldquoWe simply cannot continue with Strangford village regularly coming to a standstill, with residents being seriously affected, creating a negative rather than positive impact on local businesses and le in general due to ferry traffic.Cllr Boyle said Strangford and Portaferry had much to gain from tourism, provided there were proper structures in place to deal with vehicles wishing to board vessels on either side of the lough.He said he has discussed the problem with Cllr Enright and they believe there is a simple, cost-effective solution to addressing the problem.Cllr Boyle said it is important that visitors and tourists have a positive, not negative experience of both villages, confirming that both politicians plan to progress the issue with senior Department for Infrastructure officials.He said they also hope to contact with Stormont Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29September2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Wheelchair beach access plan  ","story":"THE possibility of trialling floating wheelchairs at beaches across the district is being considered by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The move comes after the local authority was asked to address the lack of access to beaches for those with mobility problems and officers asked to look at potential solutions.A number of politicians say they recognise the need to do more to ensure beaches can be accessed by a wide range of people by providing floating wheelchairs and special matting to allow them to travel over sand to make it to the water.The issue was discussed at last weekrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee with officers agreeing to bring back a report for discussion next month.Initially, officials will examine access to Newcastle beach before focusing on others across the district.Local councillors Patrick Brown and Alan Lewis are spearheading the drive to provide improved beach access, especially as there a number of local facilities which have been awarded prestigious blue flag status which recognises their quality.In a report presented to members of the council committee last week, officers said they were currently investigating several options and a further report will be tabled in October.She also issued a reminder of ongoing consultation on so-called changing places provision which is designed to meet the needs of people with a range of mobility issues.Cllr Harte said not everyone in a wheelchair was mobile and would need a hoist. Therefore there wouldnrsquot be much point providing floating wheelchairsthe council did not have the facilities for these people to get into or access these wheelchairs.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said that the beach access issue had been raised with him throughout the summer and he called for other beaches to be included in the pilot.He said his only concern with the motion would be thata pilot project was being proposed, the councilrsquos blue flag beaches at Tyrella and Cranfield should be considered.ldquoThe experience of wheelchair users to get on to the beach and enjoy that same thrill is a priority and we should be doing whatever we can to facilitate that, he said.ldquoThese floating wheelchairs can be taken into the water and allow people to enjoy the same experiences as everybody , things that are taken for granted.The motion to improve beach access was initially tabled in August and was inspired by the campaigning work of local activist, Naomi Herron, who approached all her local councillors askingsomething could be done to give her better access to the beach.At the time, Cllr Brown said he understood that while a small scale trial of the idea has operated in Cranfield in the past, it was important that this was expanded out into other parts of the district and that he could ldquothink of no better place than Newcastle given the large number of visitors it gets every year.He continued: ldquoAs a council, it is important that we ensure all facilities are open and accessible to all residents. It is right that we look at the issue of beach access, with a view to providing provisions for wheelchair-bound residents and visitors who wish to also enjoy our wonderful coastline.ldquo I donrsquot want this issue to go around in circles with reports, meetings and investigations. It is my hope that from this motion we see action, movement toward making the necessary access points needed to facilitate this initiative. Disabled beach access is a reality in other towns within these islands why not Newcastle.Cllr Lewis said work was needed to ensure the entire district is disabled access friendly, from changing to toilet facilities.He added: ldquoIncreased footfall to Newcastle during the good weather has brought many of these issues to the fore. As councillors, we must challenge ourselves to ensure that our district is accessible and open to all by facilitating the extra provisions needed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9364746.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He been excoriated either for being too much like a traditional unionist or for being weak kneed over the need for a pan-unionism electoral pact.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Henry McDonald is a formerand Observer Ireland correspondent and author of books including a biography of David Trimble and INLA: Deadly DivisionsThe latter critique, articulated quite forcefully and lucidly by Peter Robinson in this newspaper on Friday, needs further objective examination. Because in a sense any possible pre-election deal between Beattie’s party, Jeffrey Donaldson’s DUP or even Jim Allister and the TUV would be rendered as irrelevant unless a far greater electoral issues is not addressed: turnout.According to recent studies of elections and public attitudes in Northern Ireland it is an objective fact that unionists are more inclined not to vote compared to nationalists.In the University of Liverpool Institute of Irish Studies’ comprehensive -page analysis of the  general election and its aftermath in Northern Ireland that gap was more than ten percentage points. Among those who said they prefer to remain within the UK .% admitted they were “non-voters”. The figure of “non-voters” among those who want to reuny with the rest of Ireland was .%. The overwhelming majority therefore of those not inclined to enter a polling station were unionists.The same study also broke down the percentages of those who didn’t vote by their normal party-political affiliations. The highest group who failed to turn up at the ballot box were those who said they supported the DUP. A whopping .% of DUP supporters said they didn’t vote this time around. This compares to Sinn Fein were only .% of their supporters failed to cast their vote. Perhaps surprisingly the next party to suffer from apathy among its supporters was the Alliance Party where .% Alliance minded citizens didn’t vote either.Other credible public surveys and opinion polls find a consistent dichotomy between strong majority backing across the board for the union and a declining support for the main unionist parties at election time. This cannot just be explained alone by a lack of co-operation between those parties and the shredding of the unionist ticket in ious constituencies, which is caused by too many pro-Union candidates standing. Political apathy of course plays a part especially in working class loyalist districts where all the social indices are negative and where a pervasive sense of hopelessness can take hold in communities. As an outside observer it has always struck me as a bewildering paradox as to why these communities can pour so much energy and time into building bonfires, forming bands, organising mass parades but many of them cannot be galvanised to even get onto the electoral register let alone bother to vote.Yet for many within loyalist areas where political apathy reigns there is also a sense of frustration over who to vote for. One of my closest personal friends who would not turn against meI described him as a true-blue loyalist who wears his unionismnot on his sleeve then at least on his Harrington jacket or parka coat. Although he has numerous nationalist and republican pals, as well as political agnostics like this one, my mate is unapologetic in his love of the Union. And yet he will openly admit that he hasn’t voted for years even though he has turned up at anti-protocol demonstrations and marches of late.When pressed as to why he is allergic to the ballot box, he explains that he has no one to vote for. He responds that the traditional unionist parties repel him given his social liberalism when it comes to issues like gay rights, abortion, mixed marriage etc. This man is under the age of  and his attitudes reflect those of a large proportion of younger pro-Union cohort of the population. They might get out and vote to remain within the UK in any future border poll but at present they are not fired up politically to cast a vote for the parties dedicated to preserving that Union.The haemorrhaging of the unionist vote of course cannot just be put down solely to voters like my liberal minded friend and many like him of his generation. However, the strategistswithin unionism should realise that it is not pacts or pre-election arrangements that will really reverse the trend of a declining vote for their parties. It is the failure to encourage pro-Union supporters especially in some of the staunchest loyalist areas across Northern Ireland to put their X or their ,,s on a ballot paper. That is surely the greatest task facing Donaldson, Beattie and Allister as fresh Assembly elections loom over the horizon.• Owen Polley Oct : Unionists must stay united against the disgraceful Northern Ireland Protocol• Ben Lowry Oct : Unionism could make great headway lobbying in the United States• Peter Robinson Oct : Doug Beattie should say to where he wants UUP voters to transfer • Ruth Dudley Edwards Sep : President Higgins should say sorry for his NI centenary snub or resign• Other articles by Henry McDonald below, beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter:• Henry McDonald Sep : For all the gushing attitudes to the EU in Dublin, Brussels can’t rely on Ireland to help it with an EU army• Henry McDonald Sep : Row involving President Higgins confirms that those who want a tolerant Ireland are being marginalised• Henry McDonald Sep : Journalists should shun this Dublin-funded study into how the media uses language• Henry McDonald Sep : The cross border policing pursuit plan has not been thought through• Henry McDonald Aug : INLA’s biggest propaganda coup since Wright murder• Henry McDonald Aug : Irish nationalists can’t rely on Biden, as Kabul shows——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWhile not a great deal is known about the history of the village, there are signs of early occupation in the form of a Bronze Age flint tool and cooking mounds that have been discovered. The name of Bonvilston or Tresimwn dates back to the th century when the Norman lord Simon de Bonville was granted the manor by Robert Fitzhamon, Lord of Glamorgan and he constructed a ringwork castle as added protection for the castles at Dinas Powys and Sully.There are also references to monks being at Bonvilston and in a papal bull which is a public decree or charter issued by the Pope, a grange was mentioned in .When the parish became part of the Cottrell Estate, the last resident of Cottrell House was Mackintosh of Mackintosh from Moy in Scotland who was married to Lady Maud Cavendish. In  she donated the reading room for the male population of the village to learn to read, but it wasnrsquot until  that women were allowed in.At the end of the th century the Bassett family owned the estate and the family lived at Bonvilston House for more than  years. The house passed on through more famous names like Tudor Crawshay, the grandson of the well-known Ironmaster William Crawshay and then into the Brains brewery family. Although the house was demolished in  the lodge still remains.Gathering at Maes-y-Ffynon, which was built between  and  the group followed the bridleway at the far end of the road and walking between green hedges arrived at the busy lane which leads to Pendoylan. Crossing the lane and a stile a superb view opened out in front of them across a newly cropped field. Continuing downhill through a sheep-filled field and over the next stile they spotted two donkeys in the field, one of which looked very near to giving birth!At the bottom of the field a holly hedge was very carefully negotiated in order to enter a beautul garden belonging to Trehedyn House in the tiny hamlet of Tyrsquon y Pwll, said to be the birthplace of the Welsh hymn writer Thomas Williams, who later moved to Llantwit Major and in  built the Bethesda Chapel there.     Making their way through beautul meadows, they arrived at Lanlay Meadows in Peterston-super-Ely, which are owned by the National Trust. This quiet rural area has been farmed for centuries and the land is untouched by fertilisers, the hedges are left untrimmed, with its twisted oaks the area is rich in animal and plant le and forms part of the Ely Valley Site of Special Scientic Interest.A fairly rare plant Monkshood or Wolfsbane, which also has a number of other names, grows along the riverside and the whole plant, especially the root, is poisonous. The lovely orchard in the meadows provided the group with a great place to enjoy their morning refreshment in the increasingly warm sunshine, before backtracking slightly to follow a grassy path to the river which twists and turns its way along the northern edge of the meadows.Joining part of the Valeways Millennium Heritage Trail and following the river with its bends, nooks and crannies, an unmarked path led them through some rough, muddy ground. Then passing through fields whilst being preceded by a large herd of cattle, they exited just below the village of Pendoylan.Following a surprisingly busy road to re-enter fields on their journey to Caer Wigau Isaf, this th century Tudor manor house is Grade II listed and after a pause to admire the stunning stone and brick-work of the many buildings, they carried on through a small wooded area for the climb up to Lillypot Farm, where the fertile land was acquired by the Bonvillersquos in the th century.Climbing up through meadows they stopped for lunch at the base of their last climb whilst drinking in the stunning views across the Ely Valley. Then continuing their climb, at Lillypot Farm they were greeted by a lovely chestnut pony who was very friendly and eager to have his photo taken with them, before descending through fields near to the defensive ringwork of Y Gaer, an oval enclosure defended by a bank and ditch.Following a path bounded by gardens they arrived back at the extremely busy A to pass through the grounds of St Mary the Virgin Church, which dates from Norman times, but was rebuilt by the Victorians in  and only the tower and chancel arch remain of the original church, before ing to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
