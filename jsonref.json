How hard could it be, we asked? As it turned out, very, very hard indeedIt’s a sight that makes you want to jam on a pair of wellies, grab a rake, and start pulling the rubbish out yourself.So the Mail, which has campaigned for ten years against the scourge of plastic bags, decided to try to do just that.Inspired by our wildly successful Great Plastic Pick Up, which saw thousands take part in nationwide litterpicks, we set out to get the Don cleaned up. How hard could it be, we asked? As it turned out, very, very hard indeed.LOUISE ATKINSON kept a diary of what happened next . . .May 7, 2018The Mail runs the picture, taken on May 4, on its front page — and there is outrage. John Hourston from the campaigning group Blue Planet Society said: ‘This is the worst picture of pollution in a British river I’ve ever seen and a real wake-up call. The majority of the litter is single-use plastic.’The problem started after heavy rains in April washed floating debris into the water.As the Don flows through Doncaster it splits into numerous channels and waterways designed to stop flooding. At two points along the river’s length the current is artificially slowed.One is just by the Don Aqueduct, where the front-page picture was taken, and the other is at the back of Doncaster Prison, 15 minutes further downstream. Both spots are disgusting soups of plastic rubbish. I’m keen to tackle both.May 8REVEALED: Child is found alive in house of horrors where...EXCLUSIVE - Kimberly Guilfoyle and Don Jr. rush into dinner...Share this articleI start my inquiries, full of optimism that I can get this sorted — fast! Surely all I need is a gang of can-do volunteers, a couple of canoes and a very large roll of rubbish bags?So I check with charity Keep Britain Tidy and deputy chief executive Richard McIlwain stops my plans in their tracks: it seems I haven’t thought about today’s ever present health-and-safety rules.‘Many people are horrified at the state of our precious waterways and want to do something about it,’ he says. ‘But there can be real danger working in rivers.’He suggests first calling the Environment Agency, a government body in charge of public land and responsible for managing flooding and pollution. So I call its 24-hour incident hotline (finding the number takes some doing) to report the mess — and ask whether I can help clear it up. The hotline operative gives me an incident number and tells me to call General Enquiries in 20 minutes once my report has been logged to see if they’ll put me through to a Yorkshire-based officer. I do as I am told, but the phone operater seems perplexed. The Yorkshire-based duty officer would be the person to decide whether to accept help from the public, he says, but it was unlikely. This is all academic anyway as he won’t put me through to the duty officer.I asked if anything would be done about the horrifying mess I’d reported. He said I’d get ‘feedback within ten days’, which seems a long time to wait.That’s when I spot that a Yorkshire Environment Agency officer has tweeted the Mail’s pictures of the Don with a message: ‘I’ve taken a few reports this week of plastic and rubbish building up. We are working with landowners to get the waste removed ASAP for environmental reasons.’I send a message to him to ask how the clear-up is progressing and if he needs a hand. No reply.Surely I can do something?Keep Britain Tidy’s Richard next suggests trying the Canals And Rivers Trust, an independent charity funded by public money which has guardianship of our canals, rivers, reservoirs and docks and responsibility for keeping waterways open and useful for boats.          How shaming, then, that this image, which was published on the Mail’s front page a month ago, wasn’t taken in some impoverished part of the world but in Yorkshire — right in the middle of DoncasterOne of their employees tells me they hold clean-ups around Doncaster’s waterways twice a month but that there are no imminent plans to target the areas in the pictures.The problem for both spots, he reveals, is that any clean-up crew can’t just wade in and start pulling out plastic bottles. Any clean-up requires legal permission from whoever owns the land on the river bank as the crews will have to cross it to get to the rubbish. There also has to be a proper risk assessment and trained experts on hand for jobs like this.Establishing who owns the land is another headache. Doncaster Council says the site behind the prison isn’t theirs, and suggests I try the Land Registry website to establish ownership. The website is complex — and demands a £14.95 payment for any kind of access. Once I’ve logged in — and paid up — it can’t give me a clear answer who owns the land.May 9Having faced nothing but brick walls I decide to wield the Daily Mail’s muscle (admittedly not available to the average citizen) and try to bypass the hotlines and go straight to the top. So I call a press officer at Environment Agency HQ in London to tell him the Mail is offering to help clear it all up — and when can we start?He says he’ll look into it, and get back to me. He doesn’t. I’m beginning to get a little exasperated.Keep Britain Tidy’s Richard sympathises. He previously worked at the Environment Agency and tells me the Land Registry doesn’t log every piece of land ownership and besides, waterways are difficult. In the UK access to rivers is governed by ancient laws and any clean-up has to approved by whoever owns the land that abuts it.It might be the council, a private owner or any number of different bodies — from water firms to farms to nature reserves to foreign companies — he says.What’s more, if they only own one river bank that permission will only reach to precisely half way across the river.Stretch over the halfway point to grab an empty bottle and you could be treading on someone else’s toes so you need permission from both sides. ‘Access to rivers in England is a big bone of contention. It can sometimes be ridiculous,’ he adds wearily.You don’t say.May 10One river bank at the prison site lies at the back of the prison and the other has a small industrial estate beside it. I email the prison. No response. So I call the switchboard. The operator suggests I try the prison press office. The press officer tells me it’s not prison land — the prison merely operates on behalf of the Ministry of Justice. So I call the Ministry of Justice. They seem bemused. They ask me to email details, which I do.Then I try a bit of old-fashioned sleuthing. Holding a magnifying glass over the photo I can read the phone number on an advertising hoarding by a company called Eaton Commercial. Maybe they will know who owns the land? I call. The line is dead.May 14Just as the Great Plastic Pick Up is coming to its close I get a call from the national press officer for the Canals And Rivers Trust.She tells me they are responsible for only the towpaths and ensuring the water is navigable by boats. She says they aren’t responsible for rubbish left on or washing up on the banks — that’s a problem for the landowners, she says or my old friends the Environment Agency. ‘We’re not the river authority there,’ she says, adding, ‘It can be quite complex.’          It showed part of the River Don, which flows for nearly 70 miles from the Pennines through Sheffield and Rotherham before flowing out into the Humber Estuary — meaning this trash was headed straight out to seaMay 18I’m starting to wonder if we can speed things up a bit by offering to hire a professional SWAT team of cleaners to go in and do the clean up.I ask the Canals And Rivers Trust and they respond by presenting a different aqueduct in Wakefield which they say has created a similar plastic build-up.This one doesn’t have the same tricky land ownership issues as the two Doncaster sites. ‘It got really bad last month after the rain,’ says the press officer, ‘and it is now becoming a target for anti-social behaviour, with bits of debris being set on fire.’She says her team have been quoted a staggering £40,000 by private clearance crews to clear it up. The Trust is a charity, and £40,000 is a big chunk of its budget.It also goes some way to help explain why the various different authorities are so unwilling to leap in and clear up a stretch of water if the clean-up cost could be someone else’s responsibility. With that kind of public money required, is it really surprising responsibility gets batted back and forth while these sites remain toxic?May 20The Bank Holiday weekend has been bringing out the crowds and in Doncaster town centre, the rubbish is building up. Now there are at least another thousand plastic bottles and dozens of partially deflated footballs among the old tyres and discarded gas canisters.The warm May weather has brought flies and the trapped water has become stagnant with patches of soupy green algae. The place stinks and is swarming with flies.May 24The Canals And Rivers Trust calls to tell me a team has carried out a routine inspection of the aqueduct and in so doing, cleared a small amount of the debris.When I point out the mind-boggling short-sightedness of leaving a load of plastic rubbish there until it presents a serious risk, the spokeswoman says: ‘We’d be very happy to work with the Environment Agency to ensure a bigger clear-up happens, but this is not something we can initiate.’I’m astounded. I’ve been talking to both bodies for the past three weeks: is it really up to me to act as cupid here and get the two parties to liaise?When I go back to the press office for the Environment Agency I get my first glimpse of a breakthrough.Their spokeswoman says: ‘Our role is flood risk and water quality,’ the press officer explains. ‘We sent engineers out there to check the rubbish hadn’t created a flood risk, and checked whether it was polluting the water (you can normally tell if it is foaming, changes colour or smells bad) and they were confident there was no risk of serious damage to the eco-system.‘Although we can assure people there is no immediate risk of flooding or water quality pollution, we will work with the landowners and council to get the waste removed.’ So something is being done? They wouldn’t confirm.I ask for details, a time scale, anything ... but hear nothing.May 25The Canals And River’s Trust says they’ve drawn a blank with the site behind the prison. ‘The river is not navigable here, so it wouldn’t be possible to send out volunteers on canoes, which we do in other places. It’s also not practical to do it by hand from land. The job would be to hire some kind of crane to grab it all.’I’m back at square one on that one. Richard is sympathetic to my plight: ‘Litter in our rivers is unsightly and causes harm to native wildlife, while of course providing the route to sea for much of our plastic litter. While accepting that issues of land ownership and responsibility can be complex, this can’t be a recipe for inaction.’But he says there are fine examples of partnerships working around the country, where Keep Britain Tidy, the Environment Agency and companies, such as Severn Trent Water and Anglian Water, work with local volunteers to get litter cleared from rivers. So it can be done.May 30A month has passed. I’m on the verge of giving up. Then I get a surprise call from a very helpful press officer at the Environment Agency who tells me things are moving forwards. ‘Our team has been contacting the landowners and the local council,’ she says.Next the Canals And Rivers Trust calls to say one of their engineers has revealed that the two bodies really are actually working together to come up with a plan for the prison site. And at the aqueduct, walkers have spotted diggers, an excavator and floating rubbish clearing barges in the river. Could something be happening at last?June 2The aqueduct has been cleared of rubbish — not a plastic bottle to be seen! A major clean-up operation successfully removed more than a ton of rubbish.I’m thrilled to see the site restored to its former beauty but saddened that it was very likely to be pressure from the Mail which made it happen, and at a staggering cost to the public purse.And still the job is only half done. Behind the prison the rubbish pile still mounts. Now there’s a door, a wooden palette, traffic cones all daubed in algae and buzzing with flies. A jogger stops, incredulous. ‘This is the worst litter I’ve ever seen,’ she says, ‘It’s like a landfill site. It’s vile.’It is so saddening that the Daily Mail’s fantastic Great Plastic Pick Up was able to galvanise communities across the country and generate a palpable sense of pride and responsibility for our public areas, but still, in some pockets of the country, random littering continues and remains choked by mind-numbingly, impenetrable bureaucracy to spoil all our best intentions — and scar our beautiful land.Postscript, June 2A call from the Canals And Rivers Trust with the best possible news — a joint clean up with the Environment Agency HAS been arranged for behind the prison. A two-week project will start on Tuesday and last up to two weeks. It is expected to load six or seven two-ton wagons with plastic trash which will be taken away to be sorted and recycled.My work here is done."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/01/10/4CCE884900000578-0-image-m-20_1527844937400.jpg","title":"Wales grandmother Ann Mayer coughing 35 years","story":"    Ann Mayer, 76, (pictured) started coughing when she was 40 years old and hasn\u0027t stoppedFury as \u0027draconian\u0027 school bans packed lunches, offers Halal...Former pupil at £38,000-a-year Charterhouse who was accused...Share this articleMrs Mayer, a soprano in St Asaph Choral Society, said: \u0027I started coughing when I was 40 years old, completely out of the blue. \u0027One minute I was fine, the next I had a tickle and a splutter...

If you’re a small business you may not go in every week, but you will still need to go in for a serious discussion about a loan.’ When they shut a branch, banks must reveal how many customers rely on it under industry rules. They typically say the branches have only a handful of regular customers and are no longer cost-effective.But NatWest owner RBS classes a customer as regular only if they have been in for 23 weeks of the past 26.Lloyds’ criteria are even more restrictive, at 48 weeks out of 52 weeks each year.This means even someone who went in every week apart from Easter, Christmas and a two-week summer holiday may not be classed as regular customers.These definitions rule out many thousands of people who pop into a branch only once every couple of weeks – even though a branch closure would severely limit their access to basic services. It is also thought the figures count only those who make a transaction, meaning anyone who visits a branch for advice or information may not be included.          NatWest last month shut its branch in the busy town of Harpenden in HertfordshireDerek French, a former campaigner against unnecessary branch closures, who lives nearby, said: ‘It’s a baffling decision and the figures they quote are totally misleading.‘People here have voted with their feet and signed up with other banks instead.’ Mr French added that the decision struck him as a bad business move as well as damaging to customers.Local Tory MP Bim Afolami, had written to RBS boss Ross McEwan urging him to rethink the closure. He wrote: ‘This decision troubles me because of the number of thriving small and medium-sized businesses based here.‘Despite the shift towards online banking for personal current accounts, small and medium enterprises continue to rely on banking in branch.’ \u0027It\u0027s just so short-sighted\u0027Furious customers blasted Lloyds when it axed the last bank branch in town in Wilton, Wiltshire, as part of its drive to cut costs.It means users must travel almost four miles to Salisbury for basic banking – hitting shopkeepers as well as vulnerable elderly people who are unable to drive.In a statement justifying its decision to close the branch, Lloyds said it was used on a regular weekly basis by only 27 customers.          Lloyds has axed the last bank branch in town in Wilton, Wiltshire, to drive down costsHowever, the lender admitted that 260 people went in most months – and added that 241 customers used only the Wilton branch and had no other method of banking.When the closure was announced, town mayor Peter Edge said that bosses had helped kill the branch off by slashing its opening hours from five to three days a week in 2015.The move sparked protests from customers at the time.Councillor Edge added: ‘This is a terrible thing, as Wilton is on the up.

Liechtenstein has a similar ‘double-hatted’ scheme.It would require the creation of a ten-mile-wide buffer zone along the 310-mile border to allow farmers and traders to operate freely across the border with no need for checkpoints. Mr Davis is said to have been persuaded that technology alone could not resolve the border problem after police said checkpoints and cameras could become a target for terrorists.Sources at the Department for Exiting the EU said it had been discussed, but denied Mr Davis backed it. The DUP also suggested it was unacceptable.The lack of an Irish solution makes appears to have scuppered ministers’ hopes to have agreed customs arrangements with the EU this month. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/01/23/4CD30C0D00000578-0-image-m-19_1527891411070.jpg","title":"Quick cycle washing machine waste time","story":"    Experts said quick cycles are only good for laundry without tough stains or lingering smellsRinsing dropped from an average three stars to two stars, while spinning went from an average five stars on a standard wash to three stars on a quick wash.This means that quick washes are only really suited to laundry without tough stains or lingering smells, such as a few shirts worn for only a day.The researchers said the faster cycles use an average of 2.1 litres less water than a standard wash cycle and average energy use was less too.Cabinet alliance forms with Michael Gove and Philip Hammond...Last month sets the record for hottest May EVER as the start...Share this articleHowever, they said ‘as quick washes are generally for smaller loads, consumers might not end up saving’.A spokesman for Which? added: ‘As quick washes don’t spin your clothes as thoroughly as a full wash, it will take longer for them to dry. If you use a tumble dryer, it will consume more energy – which will cost more.’ The consumer group surveyed 1,199 washing machine owners and found 55 per cent use their quick wash ‘sometimes’ or ‘always’.          In 2011, the average standard wash time was about two hours, but now it is more than three hoursWhich? said it believed large numbers of people are using the quick wash because standard wash times are increasing.In 2011, the average standard wash time was about two hours, but now it is more than three hours.Which? said the reason standard washing cycles are getting longer relates to a theory from back in the 1960s called the ‘Sinner’s Circle’ and the need to cut down on energy consumption.While manufacturers compete to achieve an A+++ energy label, consumers are also looking to save money on their loads.Overall cleaning power is made up of five elements – temperature, detergent, spinning, water and time. If one element is decreased, another can be increased to achieve the same wash quality.Previous research by Which? found many washing machines fail to reach 60C on their 60C programmes.It said: ‘As heating the water is the most energy-intensive part, this suggests washing machine manufacturers are decreasing the temperature to cut down on energy consumption, but increasing the duration of the wash to get the same cleaning results. And longer cycles can improve efficiency by using less water.’Which? tests more than 100 washing machines a year as part of its consumer research."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/15/19/4B31121400000578-0-image-a-15_1523815839732.jpg","title":"F Ive just 8 weeks Garrick Theatre Judi Dench reveals swore paramedic","story":"    Judi Dench, 83, told a teenaged paramedic to \u0027f*** off\u0027 when he asked if she relied on a carerDon\u0027t give up on desire, Dame Judi, 82, tells mature...Dame Judi Dench is told to stop interfering in Cornish...Share this article\u0027And I\u0027m afraid I completely blew my top.

If the sun sets in the evening with a rosy glow, then there is likely to be sunshine the following morning.The saying is most reliable when weather systems predominantly come from the West as they do in the UK.So, if it’s fine in the West, then beams from the sun — as it sets in that direction— can stream unhindered through the clear skies and light up any clouds drifting off to the East.Meanwhile, the saying, ‘red sky in the morning, shepherd’s warning’ is also usually right. A red sky appears early in the day as a result of the high-pressure weather system having already moved east. This means the good weather has passed, most likely making way for a windy low-pressure system and rain — falling on the shepherds’ flocks.PLANT PREDICTORSWhen the air gets humid in the hours before rain, many wild-flowers protectively close their petals.Typical are daisies. If the white petals are closed and you cannot see the yellow middle disc, it is not wise to hang out your washing.WHY STEMS SNAPMost plants are naturally stable enough to withstand heavy rainfall.However, so many varieties that we grow in modern gardens are unnaturally made to grow faster by being given artificial fertiliser. This leads to tall, fragile stems that are insufficiently woody. It is little wonder that they snap easily under stress.ALL HAIL A STORMYou can learn a lot about the life-story of a hailstone by slicing it in half.It has a layered structure similar to the rings in tree trunks — both showing their age. Hailstones are formed in storm clouds. As they are pulled up several miles into the sky by strong wind currents, more water accumulates on their outsides and they freeze, making them bigger.When the strength of the wind drops in the highest altitudes, the hailstones fall back down into the stormy zone, where the updraught again thrusts them upward.Each time they do this they get bigger until, finally, they become too heavy to be kept in the air by wind currents and they drop to the ground.Each layer of ice is created by a single ‘up and down’ journey through the storm cloud. For example, five rings correspond to five loops of this natural rollercoaster.THE BEAK-ING CLOCKEvolution has led birds to sing at different time of day so as to give themselves a better chance to be heard rather than being drowned out.So, in order to warn off rivals, or to woo a mate, different species tend to start at different times in the morning.The skylark begins while it’s still dark — one and a half hours before sunrise. Next, redstarts begin their chorus.    Evolution has led birds to sing at different time of day so as to give themselves a better chance to be heard rather than being drowned outBlackbirds then perform exactly one hour before sunrise, with chiffchaffs following 30 minutes later.Then, as the sun appears on the horizon, all the birds join in the dawn chorus. From then on, if you want to determine the time without aid of a watch, you’ll need to turn your attention to flowers.ANT AND TREKHave you ever puzzled over why flowers that have grown for years in a certain area of your garden suddenly appear in another part the following spring? It may be because ants picked up the seeds to gorge on fleshy, oil-rich appendages (called elaiosomes) which are found on some seeds and then they drop them up to 90 feet away from the parent plant.Plants which make use of this free delivery service include wild strawberries, dog violets, wild garlic, dead-nettles and forget-me-nots.WATERING TIPSBritain averages 133 days of rain or snow a year, totalling 885 millimetres.Plants adapt to deal with these downpours in different ways. Watch, for example, how, when it rains, rhubarb uses its large, funnel-shaped leaves to catch the water and guide it down its stems to the roots. The same technique is used by dandelions.Water management in your gardens depends on the soil type. Sandy soils allow a lot of water to trickle into the deeper layers, meaning that the groundwater is well replenished, but plants can dry out quickly. On the other hand, loamy soils — a mixture of sand, silt and clay — retain moisture from which plants benefit even over long periods with low levels of rainfall.There is a simple trick for checking whether your soil is sufficiently moist: push aside the humus (the brownish black matter on top, usually just one to two centimetres deep) until you see the pure soil.Press a clump of this between your index finger and thumb. If it sticks together, it is moist enough. But if it crumbles as soon as you release your fingers, it is too dry.Of course, you can provide remedial action by watering — but don’t mollycoddle your plants by watering your garden every day. By over-watering, they get used to having moisture around their roots and spread them out close to the surface.The fact is that plants thrive when they have to make an effort to find water and therefore grow much deeper roots. By doing so, they can always meet at least part of their fluid requirements even when the topsoil has dried out. The best solution during dry periods is to drench plants thoroughly. This simulates natural precipitation and ensures the water reaches the plants’ lower roots.Since the plant then has no incentive to direct its roots upwards, this encourages resilience and allows you to go away for a fortnight without your entire garden drying out.CLUES IN THE CLOUDSThe presence of condensation trails of aeroplanes (called ‘contrails’) are an early sign of bad weather.If these don’t dissolve, it means humidity is on its way and the sky will soon cloud over. The movement of real clouds also gives clues.As a rule of thumb, the weather will always change when clouds are moving in a different direction to the direction of the wind at ground level.Tall, towering clouds on the horizon herald rain. And clouds puffed out at the top, or forming an anvil shape, mean a thunderstorm is on the way.INSECT INDICATORSThe behaviour of creatures in your garden will give you a good idea of the temperature. At 0c many cold-blooded insects have a form of anti-freeze in their circulation systems to stop them being affected by the cold. This means they are happy to fly around at temperatures just over zero degrees.For example, ladybirds and winter crane flies (also known as winter midges) produce the chemical compound glycerol, a substance once used in car anti-freeze, to stop themselves getting too cold.          When spring temperatures reach 5c, it is the trigger for toads and frogs to start spawning.Bees only leave the hive at temperatures above 12c. Also, you’ll never hear the chirping (technically called stridulating) of grasshoppers and crickets below 12c.Honey bees cluster together in hives in the winter, maintaining a core temperature of 25c.They manage to maintain this level with the energy provided from their stores of honey.TELL THE TIME, PETALDifferent plants open their flowers at different points in the day.Pumpkins and courgettes (both from the cucurbits family of plants) kick things off by opening their flowers at 5am. From 8am, marigolds spread out their golden petals and daisies follow at 9am.When the sun’s at its peak at noon, the bedding plant Mesembryanthemum opens its blossoms.Between 2pm and 3pm, after a morning’s work, dandelions start to close their heads, and by 3pm, gourd flowers have finished for the day.After doing the longest shift, poppies shut up shop at around 6pm.But it’s after sunset that certain flowers open, attracting flying pollinators — such as moths — which are on the wing for a sip of nectar at this late hour.Many plant species have adopted this late-opening strategy, including evening primrose.Others remain open all day but only start to emit their seductive aromas after dusk — common soapwort and the perennial phlox among them.If you like to sit outside on a warm summer evening, plant a few specimens of these night bloomers in your favourite spot.You’ll be well rewarded by the opportunity to observe some shy visitors, including many you may have never seen before.FEATHER FORECASTERSThe ancient saying, ‘when swallows fly high, the weather will be dry’ is not accurate. In fact, swallows fly higher than normal when the wind picks up before a storm.A much better guide to weather changes is the chaffinch (Britain’s seventh most common species of bird). It has an idiosyncratic way of warning us. In fine weather, males usually trill a melody that goes ‘chi-chip-chirichirichiri-chip-cheweeoo’.However, if rain is imminent, it sounds a monosyllabic ‘raaatch’.FLIGHT RISKSMoths orientate themselves by flying at a constant angle to the Moon.Unfortunately, they often confuse artificial street lights and domestic light-bulbs for the lunar glow.Sadly, they often crash into these man-made lights and are killed.Inevitably, predators have taken advantage. On warm summer nights, bats cleverly patrol street-lamps in the hope of easy pickings.If you want to help save insects from such a fate, close your blinds and curtains as soon as you switch on your lights after dark so as to reduce the artificial glare through your windows.The same applies to lights in your garden, which attract spiders and woodlice.SMELLING DANGERResearchers have recently discovered that plants talk to one another via ‘scent messages’.Trees, for example, warn each other about insect attacks by giving off a chemical distress signal. This is the cue for others of the same species to produce defensive chemicals that are then stored in their bark ready to give off themselves if necessary.Similarly, plants emit warning signals when under stress — for example when they are lacking food or water. Conversely, when happy with their location and have enough food, pine trees give off a sweet, aromatic fragrance.

If the sun sets in the evening with a rosy glow, then there is likely to be sunshine the following morning.The saying is most reliable when weather systems predominantly come from the West as they do in the UK.So, if it’s fine in the West, then beams from the sun — as it sets in that direction— can stream unhindered through the clear skies and light up any clouds drifting off to the East.Meanwhile, the saying, ‘red sky in the morning, shepherd’s warning’ is also usually right. A red sky appears early in the day as a result of the high-pressure weather system having already moved east. This means the good weather has passed, most likely making way for a windy low-pressure system and rain — falling on the shepherds’ flocks.PLANT PREDICTORSWhen the air gets humid in the hours before rain, many wild-flowers protectively close their petals.Typical are daisies. If the white petals are closed and you cannot see the yellow middle disc, it is not wise to hang out your washing.WHY STEMS SNAPMost plants are naturally stable enough to withstand heavy rainfall.However, so many varieties that we grow in modern gardens are unnaturally made to grow faster by being given artificial fertiliser. This leads to tall, fragile stems that are insufficiently woody. It is little wonder that they snap easily under stress.ALL HAIL A STORMYou can learn a lot about the life-story of a hailstone by slicing it in half.It has a layered structure similar to the rings in tree trunks — both showing their age. Hailstones are formed in storm clouds. As they are pulled up several miles into the sky by strong wind currents, more water accumulates on their outsides and they freeze, making them bigger.When the strength of the wind drops in the highest altitudes, the hailstones fall back down into the stormy zone, where the updraught again thrusts them upward.Each time they do this they get bigger until, finally, they become too heavy to be kept in the air by wind currents and they drop to the ground.Each layer of ice is created by a single ‘up and down’ journey through the storm cloud. For example, five rings correspond to five loops of this natural rollercoaster.THE BEAK-ING CLOCKEvolution has led birds to sing at different time of day so as to give themselves a better chance to be heard rather than being drowned out.So, in order to warn off rivals, or to woo a mate, different species tend to start at different times in the morning.The skylark begins while it’s still dark — one and a half hours before sunrise. Next, redstarts begin their chorus.    Evolution has led birds to sing at different time of day so as to give themselves a better chance to be heard rather than being drowned outBlackbirds then perform exactly one hour before sunrise, with chiffchaffs following 30 minutes later.Then, as the sun appears on the horizon, all the birds join in the dawn chorus. From then on, if you want to determine the time without aid of a watch, you’ll need to turn your attention to flowers.ANT AND TREKHave you ever puzzled over why flowers that have grown for years in a certain area of your garden suddenly appear in another part the following spring? It may be because ants picked up the seeds to gorge on fleshy, oil-rich appendages (called elaiosomes) which are found on some seeds and then they drop them up to 90 feet away from the parent plant.Plants which make use of this free delivery service include wild strawberries, dog violets, wild garlic, dead-nettles and forget-me-nots.WATERING TIPSBritain averages 133 days of rain or snow a year, totalling 885 millimetres.Plants adapt to deal with these downpours in different ways. Watch, for example, how, when it rains, rhubarb uses its large, funnel-shaped leaves to catch the water and guide it down its stems to the roots. The same technique is used by dandelions.Water management in your gardens depends on the soil type. Sandy soils allow a lot of water to trickle into the deeper layers, meaning that the groundwater is well replenished, but plants can dry out quickly. On the other hand, loamy soils — a mixture of sand, silt and clay — retain moisture from which plants benefit even over long periods with low levels of rainfall.There is a simple trick for checking whether your soil is sufficiently moist: push aside the humus (the brownish black matter on top, usually just one to two centimetres deep) until you see the pure soil.Press a clump of this between your index finger and thumb. If it sticks together, it is moist enough. But if it crumbles as soon as you release your fingers, it is too dry.Of course, you can provide remedial action by watering — but don’t mollycoddle your plants by watering your garden every day. By over-watering, they get used to having moisture around their roots and spread them out close to the surface.The fact is that plants thrive when they have to make an effort to find water and therefore grow much deeper roots. By doing so, they can always meet at least part of their fluid requirements even when the topsoil has dried out. The best solution during dry periods is to drench plants thoroughly. This simulates natural precipitation and ensures the water reaches the plants’ lower roots.Since the plant then has no incentive to direct its roots upwards, this encourages resilience and allows you to go away for a fortnight without your entire garden drying out.CLUES IN THE CLOUDSThe presence of condensation trails of aeroplanes (called ‘contrails’) are an early sign of bad weather.If these don’t dissolve, it means humidity is on its way and the sky will soon cloud over. The movement of real clouds also gives clues.As a rule of thumb, the weather will always change when clouds are moving in a different direction to the direction of the wind at ground level.Tall, towering clouds on the horizon herald rain. And clouds puffed out at the top, or forming an anvil shape, mean a thunderstorm is on the way.INSECT INDICATORSThe behaviour of creatures in your garden will give you a good idea of the temperature. At 0c many cold-blooded insects have a form of anti-freeze in their circulation systems to stop them being affected by the cold. This means they are happy to fly around at temperatures just over zero degrees.For example, ladybirds and winter crane flies (also known as winter midges) produce the chemical compound glycerol, a substance once used in car anti-freeze, to stop themselves getting too cold.          When spring temperatures reach 5c, it is the trigger for toads and frogs to start spawning.Bees only leave the hive at temperatures above 12c. Also, you’ll never hear the chirping (technically called stridulating) of grasshoppers and crickets below 12c.Honey bees cluster together in hives in the winter, maintaining a core temperature of 25c.They manage to maintain this level with the energy provided from their stores of honey.TELL THE TIME, PETALDifferent plants open their flowers at different points in the day.Pumpkins and courgettes (both from the cucurbits family of plants) kick things off by opening their flowers at 5am. From 8am, marigolds spread out their golden petals and daisies follow at 9am.When the sun’s at its peak at noon, the bedding plant Mesembryanthemum opens its blossoms.Between 2pm and 3pm, after a morning’s work, dandelions start to close their heads, and by 3pm, gourd flowers have finished for the day.After doing the longest shift, poppies shut up shop at around 6pm.But it’s after sunset that certain flowers open, attracting flying pollinators — such as moths — which are on the wing for a sip of nectar at this late hour.Many plant species have adopted this late-opening strategy, including evening primrose.Others remain open all day but only start to emit their seductive aromas after dusk — common soapwort and the perennial phlox among them.If you like to sit outside on a warm summer evening, plant a few specimens of these night bloomers in your favourite spot.You’ll be well rewarded by the opportunity to observe some shy visitors, including many you may have never seen before.FEATHER FORECASTERSThe ancient saying, ‘when swallows fly high, the weather will be dry’ is not accurate. In fact, swallows fly higher than normal when the wind picks up before a storm.A much better guide to weather changes is the chaffinch (Britain’s seventh most common species of bird). It has an idiosyncratic way of warning us. In fine weather, males usually trill a melody that goes ‘chi-chip-chirichirichiri-chip-cheweeoo’.However, if rain is imminent, it sounds a monosyllabic ‘raaatch’.FLIGHT RISKSMoths orientate themselves by flying at a constant angle to the Moon.Unfortunately, they often confuse artificial street lights and domestic light-bulbs for the lunar glow.Sadly, they often crash into these man-made lights and are killed.Inevitably, predators have taken advantage. On warm summer nights, bats cleverly patrol street-lamps in the hope of easy pickings.If you want to help save insects from such a fate, close your blinds and curtains as soon as you switch on your lights after dark so as to reduce the artificial glare through your windows.The same applies to lights in your garden, which attract spiders and woodlice.SMELLING DANGERResearchers have recently discovered that plants talk to one another via ‘scent messages’.Trees, for example, warn each other about insect attacks by giving off a chemical distress signal. This is the cue for others of the same species to produce defensive chemicals that are then stored in their bark ready to give off themselves if necessary.Similarly, plants emit warning signals when under stress — for example when they are lacking food or water. Conversely, when happy with their location and have enough food, pine trees give off a sweet, aromatic fragrance.

Pictured: The Lord Glenconner at his home on Mustique in February 1985 The Mail on Sunday has seen the sealed legal document settling the dispute, with parcels of land and shares ided up between the young Lord and the former servant, signed by both men. Adonai has inherited 27 acres of prime beachfront property, called the Beau Estate, ripe for development, which he says he will shortly put on the market for £22.5 million.Cody meanwhile, was also left a stone carving of a Lingam, a Hindu representation of the phallus that symbolises the god Shiva.Despite inheriting a fortune, Adonai said yesterday: \u0027I have not ended up with the correct share.\u0027 His main complaint is how long the case has taken while his main assets were tied up in the land, forcing him back to his former occupation of fisherman to provide for his family of seven children.He said that if he had had access to funds he would have fought the case more vigorously.He told this newspaper: \u0027I\u0027m not at all happy with the changes to the will.

According to the document, the watch goes to Adonai – not Cody.Lady Glenconner said: \u0027That\u0027s very odd, because that has sentimental family value and carries the signature of Winston Churchill, who was Lady Avon\u0027s uncle.\u0027She added: \u0027Kent was very happy with what he got and so was Cody.\u0027Lord Glenconner\u0027s home Glen House, perched between the Pitons, is now in ruins.

The circular artwork, measuring 1.2 metres in diameter, will be delivered to the winner’s home and installed for free.Fiona Measham, professor of criminology at Durham University and director of the Loop, defended its association with a controversial artist who insists on anonymity for fear of being prosecuted on drug charges.“It’s such an honour to be given this artwork by Chemical X, and not just because of his extraordinary generosity,” she said. “His art perfectly embodies the Loop’s ethos, exploring the complexities of contemporary drug use and also challenging us all to take action.“This includes empowering iniduals to question what they put in their bodies, highlighting the unknown contents consumed in pursuit of pleasure, and acknowledging the serious and even fatal impact for a small number. This artwork will help us to reach more users: the competition will raise funds for the Loop to take our harm reduction, welfare and drug testing services further afield.”Working mainly with clubbers and festivalgoers, Loop’s laboratories test the strength and quality of drugs provided by users. Similar services already operate in other European countries, offering users the chance to have their drugs tested anonymously, without fear of prosecution.Campaigners say the urgent need for more testing in the UK has been made clear following the deaths last week of two people who took super-strength ecstasy at Portsmouth’s Mutiny festival.The Loop launched its first inner-city pop-up testing service last month in Bristol. As well as having their drugs tested, users are given 15 minutes’ counselling. At one festival that used the scheme, one in five of those who had their drugs tested decided against taking them, and half said they would take less. The number of people who suffered drug-related health problems also declined.In the past, it has been reported that Chemical X’s artwork was made out of genuine ecstasy pills manufactured in a private laboratory. A London show in 2013, which used a reputed £175,000-worth of illicit pills, was apparently cancelled on legal advice.The artist, who has worked with Banksy and Damien Hirst, has stressed only that the pills used in his art are not made for consumption. In a previous interview he said: “We are very strict that no pills are used for anything other than going in the pieces.”However, others suggest that the claim that the pills used in the artworks are real is a fiction that Chemical X employs to make people question what they might be consuming when they take drugs.“My art is about potential suspended in an everlasting moment: it does not glorify nor condemn personal drug choices but, like all art, reflects society back in on itself for re-examination,” he said.His most famous work, with the pills and an eerie doppelganger of Delevingne made of silicone and fibreglass, is called Spirit of Ecstasy. Valued at £1m it was hailed as beautiful when it went on show last yearwhen it was unveiled last year .Chemical X, who does not sell through official auction houses, is not the only high-profile name to lend support to the Loop’s #TimeToTest campaign. Rapper Professor Green is offering a cameo in an upcoming music video as another prize.“The government’s rigid adherence to a policy of abstinence means that people are dying for just wanting a good night out,” Green said. “The Loop deals in reality, not empty rhetoric. I don’t want to see another avoidable drug death.”Cook has donated backstage passes for a concert in London’s Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in August.“I have witnessed The Loop in action at my last Manchester gig and I’m fully supportive of what they are trying to do,” Cook said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87c86c959dc1a445321ce116745743da9e5b6f67/0_1059_6200_3719/master/6200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60c96a8eab4fb6095d9333896caf1a20","title":"original observer photography","story":"Laura Linney, Lily Allen and Karen Gibson – the woman who rocked the Royal Wedding.

She, like everyone else, called it “the secret bookstore”. Except it wasn’t a bookshop so much as a small apartment on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, deliriously overstuffed with paperbacks and presided over by a bearded guy named Michael Seidenberg. On certain nights Seidenberg, who exudes a maverick ingenuousness, might open up his treasure cave for late-night salons where a bottle of whiskey is generally understood to be the entrance fee. Perhaps a couple of books will be exchanged for a few dollars (I once bought a bright green, 1969 first edition of Renata Adler’s Toward a Radical Middle from him for about five bucks) but sales aren’t really the point. In a city like New York, a place increasingly beholden to money, it’s good to be reminded that there are other forms of currency. Not just the civility of a bottle of bourbon, but those other, priceless currencies, too, the ones that New Yorkers don’t like to invoke because they all sound embarrassingly earnest: community, human connection and the preservation of knowledge and ideas.Seidenberg, pictured kingly in his throne of a wicker chair, feet spread, pipe in mouth, is one of around 50 New York indie booksellers featured in a series of portraits by Philippe Ungar and Franck Bohbot, a pair of bibliophilic Frenchmen who met and befriended each other in Brooklyn. The two, writer and photographer respectively, have taken great pleasure in travelling across the city, to neighbourhoods in every borough, to meet and photograph booksellers in their habitats. Despite their ersity, the way their distinct personalities and passions are reflected and amplified in their shops, they are all, says Ungar, “looking for the same thing – a generous vision of sharing culture”. Ungar mentions Corey Farach, owner of the scruffy, adored and longstanding feminist bookshop Bluestockings. Farach, as Ungar recounts with admiration, encourages those people who can’t afford to buy a $40 book to take a seat, make themselves comfortable, and just read it in the shop. “That is to me,” says Ungar, “the spirit of the indie booksellers.” Because, as he sees it, “a bookstore is much more than a bookstore, it’s much more than selling books. It’s a public shelter. Whoever you are, you don’t have to buy anything, they won’t ask you for your ID. You’re free – you can stay for hours and browse. There’s a generosity, an optimism. And that’s what we wanted to enhance.”In this way, indie bookshops are outposts of idealism. And if they seem like the most romantic places in the city, it might be down to this – to the way their owners and customers (although “guests”, frankly, seems a more appropriate term) might all be engaged in the same project, a kind of sanctuary building in the unsheltered world. No one is getting rich from indie bookselling, yet everyone Ungar and Bohbot spoke to professed contentment. “Everyone,” Ungar stresses. “Every bookseller says: ‘I’m happy.’” He mentions Bonnie Slotnick, who runs Bonnie Slotnick Cookbooks in the East Village, a small space crammed with vintage titles. Slotnick acknowledged to Ungar that she was not doing something vital, at least not in the way most people understand it. She was not a soldier or a doctor or a scientist curing disease. And yet she thought there was a place in the world for people who are just making other people happy.“They are heroes of their neighbourhood, monuments of their neighbourhood,” declares Bohbot, who sought to shoot them accordingly, with dramatic, dimmed lighting and cinematic composition in which the subject is alone, surrounded by their books. Often, there’s a poignancy to this heroism the photos are haunted with a question: how much longer can they last? New York, a city unsentimental about its past, endlessly, relentlessly revises itself. That extends to its bookshops, many of which have fallen to astronomically rising rents. St Mark’s Bookshop, for example, which opened in 1977 and became a sort of literary HQ for punks, was the oldest independent bookshop in Manhattan until it closed in 2016, despite celebrity support from Patti Smith and Salman Rushdie.Three Lives \u0026amp Company, an extremely charming West Village shop run by Toby Cox, a gentle, stooped guy in a knit hat, looked to go the same way as St Mark’s but narrowly escaped closure in 2016 after an upswell of neighbourhood support. Oliver’s Realty Group, which owns the building, provided a statement in a letter Cox sent out to his customers: “We know how beloved Three Lives is in the West Village and we’re thrilled to provide it with stability.”Like actual endangered species, independent bookshops induce a fiercely protective kind of love paradoxically, it’s often their precarity that saves them. Bohbot says he wants people to view his images and feel “we don’t know which year we are – we don’t know if it’s the future or the past”. He adds: “I want to stop time - I’m trying to keep them for ever, in this photo.”Like a bookshop, then, it’s an act of preservation.Hermione Hoby’s debut novel, Neon in Daylight, will be published by Weidenfeld \u0026amp Nicolson on 26 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d25ed743457062d6f707123fbf1aa1b700690b20/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bcf81e447b84c22ef2fc2ccb109776e","title":"street cricket the sport transforming birmingham kids lives","story":"In inner-city areas where children have few facilities, it’s easy to fall in with a bad crowd. One 12-year-old chose a different path, and is now a graduate, cricket coach and teacherAt 12 years old Siraj Ali wasn’t a bad kid. But, like many of the young people he grew up with in the outskirts of Birmingham, he’d hang out on the street at night, sometimes get in trouble at school, and had anger management issues that could boil over.“The area that I come from, the crime rates are really high,” says Ali, a decade later. “In and outside school I was getting into a lot of trouble. I wasn’t being myself. I was being dragged into the wrong crowd.”Birmingham’s reputation for gang culture and the associated crimes – such as those involving knives and guns – is widely reported. In hindsight, Ali, now 22, reckons he was at risk of slipping into that “bad crowd” and that if things hadn’t changed he’d carry a criminal record by now and struggle to get a job.Thankfully, things did change – and in September 2017 he graduated from the University of Wolverhampton with a degree in sport, media, culture and development. He’s currently confident of being hired by a teaching agency and, perhaps most importantly for him, he’s teaching young people cricket at his local leisure centre, where he hopes he can help others negotiate the dangers of growing up in that neighbourhood.“If I hadn’t got involved in cricket something bad would have happened to me,” he says. “When I went to Street they just dragged me in another direction.”He’s referring to Chance to Shine Street, a charity that uses cricket as a means to build young people’s confidence, social skills and focus – while keeping them off the streets for a few hours a week. With the help of its official long-term partners, NatWest – who have a long history of supporting grassroots cricket to support communities and help make the game accessible to all – Chance to Shine Street has helped more than 38,000 youngsters since 2008. The broader Chance to Shine programme has introduced more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – to cricket since its inception.Now a coach with the organisation, Ali first encountered Street (as it’s generally known) as an angry 12-year-old. Invited along to a session by a local coach, he grew frustrated, smashed over the wickets and walked out. Luckily, both he and the coaching staff persevered. Ali went on to play around the country in his teens, continued playing for local T20 sides while at university, and is now dedicated to using cricket to help the kids coming of age in the Alum Rock and Saltley areas of Birmingham.“I’ve been coaching at the local leisure centre for four or five years now,” he says. “I enjoy the role because it’s challenging. With some of the kids you don’t know what’s going on at home or at school. But I always try to ask questions: ‘How are your studies? Are you getting into trouble? How are things at home?’”Ali, who coaches primary-school children as well as those in secondary school, reckons the key to Street’s power is the way cricket can help instil a sense of confidence in young people. “Street cricket is available for all kids, and it’s a fun and friendly environment,” he says. “These sessions are in areas where there isn’t much opportunity for kids, and they offer a chance for them to help themselves grow in many ways, such as in confidence. This is very important for kids – it can be very beneficial for them in their education.“When they play in a group, a big group of 13 or 14 kids, it’s a different crowd every time – one’s funny, one’s low on confidence, one’s very confident. They sit together, talk to each other, express how they feel and they become good friends. They work together like that. That’s the main key to our organisation – to help kids work together and get on and help each other.”Many of the young people he’s worked with over the past five years have gone on to a college education or university. The player-turned-coach attributes his ability to reach students to the fact that he’s been through the same things they’re going through the children can relate to him in a way they sometimes can’t to parents or teachers. “I understand them because I came from the same community and I’ve been through this all at a young age,” he says. “It’s all about understanding the kids and what they go through. Some of the children I have worked with are now playing for Warwickshire youth teams, so this is progress, and I will continue to help kids.”Mentoring is something Ali enjoys – and that influenced his choice of degree, which is focused on the development of young people. But it’s been a two-way street. At university, Ali found he was more confident than many of his peers, thanks to his time spent speaking to large groups of young people and working with people from across the charity and beyond.“When I first joined the street project as a coach, things were a lot different and I wasn’t confident leading sessions,” he says. “Coach Khaled worked with me and he started to review my performance. Week by week I was growing in confidence, and this confidence has been vital when I’ve had to make presentations at university or lead my group in front of the whole class. I am now a graduate and I am looking to continue to inspire kids and help them grow their passion for cricket and their education.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981. NatWest are proud to be the principal partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the official partners of Chance to Shine, reflecting the bank’s own values and commitment to fairness and inclusion.To find out more, visit Natwest Cricket"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8781866df9fab27fa46c2eea36d77dc5d54a7efc/0_76_2272_1363/master/2272.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25cabc602a8fcd16eae3ac88fc9ba23e","title":"benedict cumberbatch saves deliveroo cyclist london","story":"Sherlock actor said to have jumped out of cab after seeing Deliveroo rider being attackedBenedict Cumberbatch is reported to have saved a cyclist who was being attacked.

I was a glutton for international trips, ticking off European cities I could visit in a weekend, backpacking around swathes of south-east Asia and Central America, and road-tripping across New Zealand and California. A relentless neophiliac, I firmly believed that “away” was intrinsically superior to “home”.It was a trip to New Zealand that planted the first seeds of doubt about my internationally-attuned travel palate. Campervanning around the islands, I realised that I’d been taking a lot of the delights of the UK for granted: our storied towns and villages the fact that long country walks can be bookended by pints and pies in historic pubs a public transport system that reaches into the peripheries our shark-free waters and uncrowded beaches. When enthusiastic UK-bound Kiwis would ask me for recommendations, I desperately wanted to be able to share insider tips beyond the three cities I’d lived in so far: Belfast, Glasgow and London.This experience gently encouraged me to view my homeland through the eyes of a tourist, and when I returned home, I launched Project UK. I began gently, with a day trip to the Somerset town of Bruton, where I wandered around the Hauser \u0026amp Wirth art gallery and stumbled upon a restaurant, At the Chapel, which I would cheerfully eat at every day. Next was a camping trip to Dorset, travelling entirely by public transport and drinking cider at the Square \u0026amp Compass. I swam off Shetland’s wild, deserted beaches I cycled the Kentish coastline, I rock-climbed in the Peak District, and then I realised that much of what I thought I had to travel for was right here on my doorstep.As well as pure pragmatism - saving time travelling, the absence of a time difference or jetlag, reducing my carbon footprint - there are a growing number of “pull factors” keeping me closer to home, stopping me from straying abroad.Embarking on a meaningful relationship with my home country - rather than flightily flouncing off for flings with far-flung destinations - has enriched my enjoyment of history, literature, music and art. These days I track different destinations and bands via Songkick so I can plan UK city breaks around gigs I want to go to - because Cardiff, Liverpool, Leeds, Belfast, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh are some of the best cities in the world in which to catch a gig. I keep a rolling list of destinations that have, until now, only existed in my imagination – the Yorkshire moors that inspired my beloved Brontës, the lakes that I read about in the poetry of Wordsworth, Shelley and Coleridge, and, um, parts of the Northern Ireland coast that provide the backdrop for sex, blood and gore in Game of Thrones.It’s rewarding to bump into a Glaswegian and enthuse about the burgeoning culinary scene in Finnieston. It’s been satisfying to join up some of the dots and understand why post-industrial Birmingham became the birthplace of heavy metal music. And now, when I read a Daphne du Maurier novel like Rebecca or My Cousin Rachel, I can visualise the Cornish scenery she renders through words. I’ll never lose my lust for long-haul international travel, but learning to see the UK through the wide eyes of a visitor means I’ll never take home for granted again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/023f29a85170eda53eb8ecd4ee1d932ab6ee3fc9/0_0_5651_3391/master/5651.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=597bff482d92a878015e406dd1722157","title":"quiz have you got the entrepreneur gene","story":"Dreaming of ditching the nine to five?

At London’s All Points East event during the late May bank holiday, rapper Stefflon Don performed her set in a black, long-sleeved crop top from her collaboration with the online retailer Boohoo. The musician Sudan Archives, one of the highlights of Field Day, in Brockwell Park, south London, on 1 and 2 June is also a fan.It’s no coincidence that cropped tops have struck the right style note with some of the world’s most popular Instagram stars – making this another trend that can be attributed to “the influencer effect”. Selena Gomez, the most-followed person on Instagram with 138 million users, wore one in the music video for her recent single,Marshmellow Wolves. Kylie Jenner (109 million followers) likes hers in sweatshirt fabric, while model sisters Gigi and Bella Hadid, who have a combined following of 58 million users, have both recently shared images of them wearing their favourite cut-off piece.The trend is an extension of what was on the catwalk in the springsummer collections 2018, where crop tops came at us from myriad directions. Large luxury fashion houses such as Versace, Chanel and Balmain all made them a prominent catwalk feature, as did smaller, hip brands such as Marques Almeida, Off-White and JW Anderson (and the Hadid sisters were both sporting versions for Tommy Hilfiger in Milan).The item does, however, come with a word of warning: “Like crochet dresses and dex onesies – perennial festival favourites – the cropped top will not protect you from the elements,” says Alice Newbold, news editor of British Vogue. “Think of the awkward sunburn, and it’s not that transitional, unless you’re hopping from yoga tent to meditation tepee.“Festival fashion is all about keeping it real and laying practical outfit foundations – unless your crop is a sports bra worn as an underlayer when schlepping across the field with a tent on your back, it doesn’t really count.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dba29e22a19535d3791fef36f0ab7ebde8fce7b/0_32_3488_2092/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=198782cd1654c2bc429ae95d93a47f58","title":"england nigeria match report","story":"The encouraging news for England is that Harry Kane is looking sharp, Raheem Sterling seems remarkably unaffected by all the recent scrutiny and, if Gareth Southgate’s team can play in the World Cup as they did here during the opening 45 minutes, perhaps it is not too outlandish to think they can make a decent impression in Russia after all.Unfortunately that tells only part of the story and with England there always seems to be a cloud attached to every silver lining. Two-nil ahead at half-time, Southgate’s team looked on course to bid farewell to Wembley in style. As it was, the England manager must have been startled by their deterioration as Nigeria, such obliging opponents throughout the opening 45 minutes, pulled one back through Alex Iwobi and had enough of the ball thereafter to think they could have saved themselves.That period was a stark reminder that England will fly to Russia on Tuesday week as very much a work in progress, pinning their hopes on a relatively inexperienced group of internationals.Overall the good outweighed the bad but it was a close-run thing at times and Southgate must wonder why his players lost their momentum after such an impressive first-half performance, featuring goals from Gary Cahill and Kane and the clear impression of a team capable of playing slick, joined-up football.They could not keep it up and that meant a rather awkward atmosphere after the final whistle when Southgate’s players gathered in the centre of the pitch for a choreographed show of togetherness.Most of the crowd had already left although the ones who had stayed behind did return the players’ applause and, on the positive side, Southgate was so encouraged by the first-half display – “an excellent performance with the ball” – it is still perfectly conceivable this will be the team that starts against Tunisia in Volgograd on 18 June.Southgate, in other words, has chosen not to employ orthodox wingers in a 3-5-2 system – or 3-3-2-2, to be entirely accurate – with Sterling operating in a central attacking position alongside Kane. Kieran Trippier and Ashley Young will be expected to provide the width as attacking full-backs. Dele Alli was chosen ahead of Ruben Loftus-Cheek, most probably because of the Tottenham Hotspur player’s understanding with Kane, and Jesse Lingard’s selection was another sign that Southgate wants two attacking midfielders who will make it their business to enter the opposition penalty area. Alli and Lingard have better scoring statistics than Loftus-Cheek and that counted in their favour.Trippier, in the right-wing-back role, demonstrated his ability to deliver pinpoint crosses with the seventh-minute corner for Cahill’s headed goal and here, too, was evidence that Southgate’s preferred system allows Sterling to exert more of an influence than if he was playing on the wing.Southgate admitted afterwards he gave serious consideration to dropping Sterling from his starting line-up because the Manchester City player reported a day late for training. Southgate decided against it because he did not want to add to the blizzard of headlines surrounding Sterling and the player looked determined to justify that decision. Sterling played as though he did not have a care in the world – a constant menace to the Nigerian defence with his speed, direct running and ability to create space for others. In the first half, anyway.Unfortunately for Sterling, he is going through one of those periods in which he seems to have a magnetic attraction to controversy and, as Southgate has acknowledged, not all the criticism is unjustified. This one came in the form of a penalty-box e seven minutes into the second half and, justifiably, he was shown a yellow card for his troubles. Sterling’s intention was to make it look as though the Nigeria goalkeeper, Francis Uzoho, had brought him down when, in reality, it was the England player trying to initiate the contact. It was poor on Sterling’s part and the Italian referee, Marco Guida, did not fall into the trap.Perhaps that moment summed up England’s nervousness at the start of the second half. Nigeria were so overwhelmed during the opening 45 minutes that their manager, Gernot Rohr, brought on four substitutes straight after the interval, as well as switching to a three-man defence – and that, according to Southgate, threw his own players.England had looked entirely comfortable until that point but the complexion of the game changed when Odion Ighalo, the former Watford striker, cracked a shot against the post and Iwobi fired in the rebound.England had plenty of defenders in close proximity. None could get to the ball ahead of Iwobi and suddenly the boisterous hordes of Nigerian fans behind that goal started to turn up the volume.Kane had doubled England’s lead in the 39th minute from Sterling’s pass, firing in a right-footed shot from the edge of the penalty area and fortunate that Uzoho a made a pig’s ear of keeping it out.In the second half, however, England’s front two were never so threatening and, as Southgate pointed out, if they lose their focus so badly in the World Cup “it might put you out”. At least England held on, but the game drifted rather aimlessly to its conclusion and Southgate will hope for a less erratic performance when Costa Rica are the opponents in Leeds on Thursday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d085e058d6350fcd6b226409171479c8c84929b7/9_45_3473_2084/master/3473.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f160d1976d2a7377c2627499e2187886","title":"nigeria world cup football kit captures public imagination","story":"Fans queue in London before England match for shirts that sold out in minutes onlineNigeria may be about to play England in a friendly football match at Wembley, but it is their eye-catching kit that has captured the public’s imagination – orders have already been placed for 3m of the replica shirts.Throngs of shoppers queued outside Nike’s flagship store on Oxford Street on Friday morning to get their hands on the top.Both the home and away shirts, priced at £64.95, reportedly sold out online within three minutes. The kit sports a feathered pattern in homage to the Nigerian team that made its World Cup debut in 1994.Finishing top of a group including Argentina and Bulgaria, “Naija”, as the team are known, bowed out in the round of 16 in heartbreaking fashion.In Nigeria itself, the demand for the shirt before its release resulted in copycat kits appearing in Lagos markets last week.“Right now in Nigeria, the jersey is one of the best, and I am happy selling it,” one market trader in the capital told the BBC. “Nike has not officially started selling, that’s for sure. But it’s not a top-notch quality like the one you can get from the Nike shop. When you know the prices also you cannot compare with it.”The country is hoping that the shirt, with its eagle wing-inspired black-and-white sleeve and green torso, will help propel them to victory in their third consecutive World Cup.Arsenal’s Alex Iwobi and Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi were among the players who modelled the kit, first unveiled in February, alongside the away shirt – a “cool, refined vision” of the classic full-green strip – for the promotional photos.The makers said the away kit was a longstanding symbol of a nation that could boast of having “the world’s most expressive team”.Nigeria will wear their new shirt on Saturday in their World Cup warm-up game against England, who are expected to clock up a comfortable victory.However, with other Premier League stars representing the west African nation, including Leicester City’s Kelechi Iheanacho and Chelsea’s Victor Moses, the hosts will have to keep their eye on the ball, and off their opponents’ kit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e058a2ced9c05b08583a4fcaab8b2877dbf04c5/0_25_3157_1894/master/3157.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=677eb41f7c86ce9e60e3b5b46cb7c34a","title":"raheem sterling mothers boy jamaica man england","story":"Raheem Sterling once claimed his face was responsible for the criticism he has learned to dismiss during his years at Manchester City, Liverpool and England. “You know, when you see someone on TV and go, ‘I don’t like him’,” he explained. “Some people have that face, and I’ve got it.”This week it was his right leg. The outcry over a tattoo of an M16 assault rifle prompted a revealing response from the 23-year-old on Instagram, however. “When I was 2 my father died from being gunned down to death I made a promise to myself I would never touch a gun in my life time,” he wrote. “I shoot with my right foot so it has a deeper meaning.”Sterling never knew his father, who was killed in Jamaica, but says he has been inspired by him on the biggest occasions of his short career. It is his mother, Nadine, who he cites as the greatest influence, as well as his harshest critic.They emigrated from Kingston to England four years after Sterling’s absent father was murdered, and settled in Neasden, north-west London, where the gifted youngster played football in the shadow of Wembley stadium and attracted scouts from Queens Park Rangers. A tattoo of a young boy holding a football and looking up at the Wembley arch is etched on Sterling’s forearm. That one passed without national debate.Sterling was removed from mainstream education because of behavioural problems and spent three years at Vernon House special school, where his teacher, Chris Beschi, told him: “If you carry on the way you’re going, by the time you’re 17 you’ll either be playing for England or you’ll be in prison.” He was, Beschi said, “the kid in school who had a kind and innocent passion about him”.The winger was recruited by QPR as a 10-year-old, but his mother, worried about the influence of gang culture, resolved that he should leave London when scouts from leading Premier League clubs began to call. Arsenal, Chelsea and Fulham were all keen to sign Sterling, but location counted against them. That enabled Liverpool to secure his services, beating City to a deal. The club’s offer to QPR of £450,000, rising to £2m depending on progress, was instrumental in the move north.Frank McParland, former academy director at Liverpool, persuaded the Anfield club and then manager Rafael Benítez to sanction a sizeable outlay for an untested 15-year-old. Days after his arrival on Merseyside, Sterling made his debut for Liverpool in an under-18s game against local rivals Everton. Within minutes he was felled by a heavy challenge from the Everton left-back. McParland and Kenny Dalglish, watching from the sidelines, feared the worst for the slight teenager. Sterling rose to his feet, smiled at his larger opponent and clattered him back at the first opportunity.McParland says: “Raheem is relentless. He loves playing football and he has always been like that. When we used to do the fitness tests, he used to be the quickest and the fittest. So he would run the longest in the bleep test and also be the fastest. He is the best kid I have ever had. He blocks everything out to concentrate on the game and, if something doesn’t work for him, he’ll go again. You never see him hiding.”Sterling flourished at Liverpool. At 15 he appeared as a substitute in a pre-season friendly for Roy Hodgson’s team against Borussia Mönchengladbach. Dalglish, Hodgson’s replacement as manager, gave him three substitute appearances in the Premier League. At 17, and under another new manager, Brendan Rodgers, he made his full league debut at Anfield against Manchester City. A full England debut against Sweden followed three months later.Rodgers, a former youth academy coach at Chelsea and now Celtic manager, played an influential role in Sterling’s development, on and off the pitch. Alongside Luis Suárez and Daniel Sturridge, Sterling formed part of an exhilarating attack that almost took Liverpool to their first league title for 24 years in 2014.Rodgers had kept Sterling on his original £2,000-a-week contract for as long as possible at Liverpool. “There is one common denominator when it comes to young players falling by the wayside – money. It distorts reality, it changes people. I’m always cautious of that. I had Raheem playing for England and a regular in the Liverpool first team on £2,000 per week,” he said. “I stretched it out as long as I could.”The former Liverpool manager delivered an uncharacteristically public warning to the teenager when, having signed a new contract worth £35,000 a week, his form deteriorated. “He needs to stabilise his life, understand the remarkable opportunity he has at one of the biggest clubs in the world and focus everything on his career,” said Rodgers, after Sterling was cleared of assaulting a former girlfriend.A charge of common assault had also been dropped against Sterling earlier in 2013, but two court cases in quick succession prompted Rodgers to intervene. The player took the advice and, not for the first time, sought stability in a new location, moving from Liverpool to Southport. His mother moved with him before returning to London.Money and ambition were at the heart of Sterling’s orce from Liverpool. He and his agent, Aidy Ward, rejected a £100,000-a-week contract at Anfield while denying claims of greed in an interview with the BBC. After 123 games and 29 goals for Liverpool he was sold to City in 2015 for a fee rising to £49m – making him the most expensive English footballer ever at the time. The 23-year-old earns about £200,000 a week in Manchester and talks have opened over a new deal.Sterling is understandably wary of the media. “I can’t win,” he said, when reflecting on coverage of him eating a Greggs sausage roll while sitting in his limited edition Bentley – and public criticism has affected his performances for Liverpool, England and City. But he is open and articulate and extremely quick-witted when the guard comes down. He has a son, Thiago, with fiancée Paige Milian and a daughter, Melody Rose, from a previous relationship. The forward’s belief that his trophy cabinet would be enhanced at City has been vindicated. He lifted the League Cup at Liverpool’s expense in 2016 and this season, under the demanding guidance of Pep Guardiola, has produced the finest football of his career. Sterling scored 23 goals as City cruised to the Premier League title with a record 100 points. “He’s got bollocks,” said Hodgson, before the last World Cup in Brazil. The former England manager also cautioned Sterling that people “would stop looking for the benefits your game gives and start looking for the potential negatives”, words that ring true four years on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ecefec94c6c0924497d3b3e57c6e12184decb78/0_51_4744_2847/master/4744.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e6f7bfc242749ffc57688e60dc02a34","title":"england v nigeria international friendly live","story":"Gary Cahill and Harry Kane were on target as England tamed the Super Eagles at Wembley.Dominic Fifield on Raheem Sterling:So that completes our business in the MBM, on a decent if ultimately unspectacular evening for England. All that’s left is to say thanks for reading ... and to point you in the direction of Daniel Taylor’s match report from Wembley Stadium. Next stop Leeds, and Costa Rica on Thursday night!And now a word from Gareth Southgate. “I think we played really well, with the ball especially, and created a lot of good chances. Far more good situations than we’ve had in our recent games, so I was very pleased with that. Deserved lead a couple of goals to the good at half-time. It took us a little while to work out how to deal with the changes to their system, there was a seven or eight-minute period when we hadn’t quite worked out how to adjust. It meant there was a lift in the game that we had to deal with and manage, so that was a decent exercise for us, though of course you’d rather it was more comfortable. I thought Raheem Sterling played well. The front four looked a threat. Slightly better decision making in the final third, and we’d have scored more.”The captain Harry Kane speaks. “It was a good win, they’re a tough side. First half, I thought we were excellent. We moved the ball quick, got in behind, created a lot of chances. Second half we had trouble, they changed their formation. They scored early, which always puts the pressure on. But we got used to it and we saw the game out well. I feel I’m at my best, feel really good. Getting on the scoresheet is always nice as striker. Costa Rica on Thursday will be another tough one, another test. But I’m looking forward to it, and the next month.”All in all, a good day at the office for England. They were highly impressive in the first half, thoroughly deserving of their two-goal lead it probably should have been more, but calmness in front of goal came at a premium. Nigeria however were awful during that opening 45. But the visitors came back strongly in the second half, showing more of the verve that took them past Cameroon in the qualifiers and did for Argentina recently. England then lost their way a bit. So it’s one of those matches: both teams have something positive to take away with them. England more so, obviously, having won the match, but you get the general drift.And that’s that. England’s preparations for the World Cup have started well. Very well in the first half, perhaps not so well in the second. But a win’s a win’s a win. Polite applause ripples around Wembley accordingly.90 min +3: Ebuehi accidentally studs Rose in the knee. Thankfully, after the initial sting of contact, Rose springs back into action.90 min +2: Welbeck races into a lot of space down the right. He’s got Rashford free in the middle, but opts to go it alone, stumbles slightly, and all momentum is lost.90 min +1: Musa curls a cross in from the left. Iheanacho is lurking, but Cahill batters a header away from danger.90 min: Nigeria see a lot of the ball, but England hold firm and the visitors can do little with it. There will be four added minutes.88 min: Mikel embarks on an intricate run down the middle of the park. He lays off for Musa, who nearly breaks into the box. Not quite. The ball’s recycled and a hail-mary is sent down the centre. Pickford comes out to punch. Mikel clatters into him, and that’s a free kick for England. What a delicious dribble by Mikel, though.86 min: Delph, quarterbacking from deep, lifts a pass down the inside-right channel for Rashford, who attempts to guide a first-time header over Uzoho and into the top left. It goes over the bar, but a decent effort all round.85 min: This match is beginning to peter out. England are quite content to sit back and stroke it around, killing the clock.84 min: Now it’s Nigeria’s turn to ping the ball around nicely. Mikel and then Iheanacho threaten to cause England a bit of bother as they press towards the box, but the home side hold their shape and there’s no way through. Nigeria are forced to turn back upfield.82 min: Alli departs to those pantomime boos from the Nigeria fans. Delph takes his place.80 min: A period of England possession out on the left. Some crisp passing. It ends when Rashford looks for the bottom left from distance. He drags his shot well wide.79 min: The corner is a complete waste of time.78 min: Welbeck turns on the jets and makes down the inside-right channel. He cocks his leg to shoot as he enters the box, but Ekong slides in to deny him. Corner.77 min: Musa is booked for flipping Loftus-Cheek over with a sliding tackle from behind.76 min: Iheanacho, who scored a pearler here for Leicester City against Spurs on the last day of the Premier League season, comes on for Ighalo.75 min: For the second time this evening, two Nigerians accidentally head-butt each other. This time it’s Etebo and Omeruo. Play stops as they receive treatment. This has got very bitty, as the second halves of friendlies so often do.73 min: The captain Kane is replaced by Welbeck, while Sterling makes way for Rashford.72 min: Speaking of fluids, everyone stops for a drink.71 min: Trippier and Loftus-Cheek combine neatly down the right, the latter skittering into space. Loftus-Cheek dinks one into the box, but it files over the head of Kane, who was waiting patiently to head that one home. A nice idea, though, and a nostalgic reminder of England’s first-half fluidity.69 min: Musa beats Walker in a foot race down the left, then pulls back in the hope of finding Iwobi. Stones clears, after a fashion, slipping on the seat of his pants as he does so. Mikel regains possession and has a blast for the bottom right from distance. Pickford’s not going to be beaten from there.68 min: Dier and Walker take turns to slice wild clearances into the air. Ighalo’s shove on Stones gets England out of a spot of self-inflicted bother.67 min: England make a double change. Rose and Loftus-Cheek take the place of Lingard and Young.66 min: A nod to the 1980s as Stones, of all people, blooters the ball straight down the middle of the pitch. He very nearly releases Sterling, but Uzoho reaches the edge of his box first to claim.64 min: Ighalo is crumped by Walker, and that’s a free kick out on the Nigerian left. Etebo curls it into the loaded England box, where it’s headed confidently away by Dier.63 min: Musa comes on for Moses.62 min: Lingard feeds Alli down the left, and England win a corner. Young takes. It’s a brilliant whip towards the near post. Dier rises and flashes a header across the face of goal and out for a goal kick. What a chance ... and what a corner by Young.61 min: Idowu looks for Moses with a long, looping pass down the left. Moses didn’t anticipate it. A shame for Nigeria. England need to wake up.59 min: Ogu earns a corner down the right. Then from the set piece, he misplaces a pass and Sterling is nearly allowed to zip up the other end. Idowu puts a stop to his gallop with a fine tackle.58 min: Lingard buzzes in from the left and tries a one-two with Kane. It doesn’t come off, and Kane cocks his head back to scream in frustration. England have misplaced their first-half mojo.56 min: Alli cuts in from the left and rolls a pass down the centre for Lingard. The ball’s a step behind Lingard, who can’t take it with him. A few centimetres the other way, and Lingard was clean through. Nigeria go up the other end, Moses blootering a wild - and wildly ambitious - effort miles over the bar from a silly distance. A real sense that this match isn’t going to end 2-1.54 min: Mikel is given an absurd amount of room in the midfield. He strides with great intent towards the England box, but with the hosts on the retreat clanks an awful pass straight into a white shirt, with plenty of his attacking team-mates offering options.52 min: Lingard slips a pass down the inside-right channel, hoping to find the scampering Sterling. Uzoho comes out to smother. Sterling buckles his knees and starts falling before he clatters into the keeper ... and is booked for ing. It’s the correct decision, and his week isn’t getting any better.50 min: But Nigeria come straight back at England and earn another corner down the left. The resulting set piece isn’t anything to write home about, but it’s fair to say Nigeria look a totally different side already. England are still in the dressing room.49 min: Ighalo works his way down the left and earns a corner. On the bench, Southgate looks concerned. The set piece is headed vaguely goalwards by Iwobi, but cleared by Cahill.Well this is a game-changer! Iwobi drops deep and sends Ighalo haring towards the England box with a cute dink down the inside right. Ighalo creams a fine shot off the left-hand post it rebounds to Iwobi, who slams home. What a fine goal that was!And we’re off again! It’s as you were for England, but Nigeria make four changes: Onazi, Obi, Shehu and Balogun are off Etebo, Ogu, Omeruo and Ebuehi come on. This won’t be an end of it, either, will it.Half-time entertainment. Earlier this week, Viv Anderson picked his all-time England World Cup XI. Thanks to the power of modern, interactive, time-frittering internet technology, you can have a go yourself! Select a spine of Sam Hardy, Bob Crompton, Duncan Edwards and George Camsell, and take it from there.That’s been a no-nonsense 45 minutes from Gareth Southgate’s side. Some of their attacking play was very easy on the eye. Nigeria will maybe take heart from those late bursts by Victor Moses ... but otherwise they’ve not threatened England at all.45 min: Moses has clearly had enough of his team’s bluntness in attack. He has another romp down the left himself, twisting and turning, and finally sending a rasper towards the bottom left. Pickford gathers again.44 min: Moses tries to make something happen, picking up his heels and skedaddling down the left. But Dier blocks the route in unceremonious fashion.43 min: England play a bit of keep-ball, just because they can. As poor as Nigeria have been, the hosts have looked very impressive. They’re in total control.41 min: This scoreline doesn’t flatter England at all. Nigeria, by contrast, have been dreadful.Kane had done very little. But that was never going to last, was it. He makes good down the inside-left channel, then tees up Sterling to the right of the D. Sterling can’t sort his feet to shoot, so returns the favour. Kane sends an immediate slapshot goalwards. Uzoho makes an awful hash of it, the ball going right through him and into the bottom left.37 min: Kane loops long down the middle for Alli. He cushions the ball down for Sterling on the edge of the box. Sterling sends a rising drive inches over the bar. Not far away from planting that one into Cahill Corner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00a3665ec2f98480e3dd7d240cd5c41a86016dce/0_84_2469_1481/master/2469.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27c227b426d6946e941ecc9a7a8246cf","title":"republic of ireland usa international friendly live","story":"And that’s all for today. Enjoy your evening on the right side of the pond, and enjoy your late afternoon on the left side.From the Irish perspective, can’t really complain about rallying to win at home with a few young folks in the lineup as well. The patient defense was rarely out of place aside from one lapse before halftime.From the U.S. perspective, that was mildly disturbing. It’s one thing for the young attackers to hesitate just a bit too much. It’s another for the anointed defense of the future to be at sea on every set piece. Bill Hamid makes a convenient scapegoat, but the center backs -- both with big-time clubs and getting experience on loan -- have to be better.A good cheer as the whistle blows.90 min +4: Walters and Moore argue about something.This can’t be argued: 90 min +3: Have we seen an indication of stoppage time? Doesn’t matter. Ireland are killing it well.90 min +1: Weah and Sargent pass back and forth in the box, unable to come up with a good shot.McClean shreds the U.S. center backs, and the substitute Alan Judge practically takes the ball from his foot to rip it into the top of the net despite Hamid’s touch.88 min: This time, Ireland take the free kick backwards and float in a harmless cross. The U.S. center backs struggle to flick it to a safe position.Maybe it’s just experience, but the U.S. set-piece defense has been abysmal. 87 min: Shaq Moore announces his presence with a truly unnecessary foul on Daryl Horgan, who had just played a harmless cross.The free kick from the flank will be retaken because the ref wanted to book Joe Corona for an elbow to the chest.84 min: Another cross from the impressive O’Dowda, collected by Hamid.Hard to see a late winner here. I write that knowing I will, through the rules of Murphy’s Law or karma, ensure that a winner will be scored.Another sub: Joe Corona replaces Weston McKennie, prompting a soliloquy on the lack of solidarity pay from Taylor Twellman on behalf of FC Dallas, which got nothing when McKennie went overseas.For Ireland, Harry Arter of Bournemouth replaces Jeff Hendrick.On the goal (the one that counted), Graeme Thorn writes: “As soon as the US defenders cross behind the goal-line, they’re considered to be on the line itself for offside purposes, so Burke wasn’t offside when the shot came in. I can’t tell from the replay whether he actually touched it before the ball crossed the line, though.”There were indeed a couple of American defenders so far out of the play that they could write a Yelp review of a nearby pub. For the USA, Luca de la Torre of Fulham replaces Rubin.76 min: Half-chance for Weston McKennie against a curiously passive Irish defense. A good first touch sets him up for a shot from 15 yards, which he hits with pace but straight at the keeper.75 min: Hamid snares a McClean cross with an attacker lurking.Debut for Shaq Moore, the La Liga-based defender. He comes into the game along with Josh Sargent, the striker based in Germany. Two young prospects entering in the 70th minute with the USA reeling in Dublin.U.S. defensive woes. No matter how much blame you give to the rusty Bill Hamid, whose move to Denmark has not panned out, the USA will have other options in goal.Should U.S. fans be more concerned by the alleged center-back tandem of the future, Carter-Vickers and Miazga? They were poor on the goal and shaky at several more points today.Irish free kick, and Lenihan heads the ball past Hamid. He was offside.66 min: Half-chances for the USA. Wood has a tame shot saved. Weah shoots high.Here’s the Irish goal -- Burke may well have been offside. Or he may have been over the line. A call would’ve been harsh, and the USA were justly punished:63 min: CHANCE -- Walters makes a nice move at the top of the box and has the goal at his mercy but fires wide.62 min: Well, it’s all getting interesting now, as the phenom Weah (yes, George is his father) turns sharply and forces a save.DEBUT for Tim Parker, formerly of Vancouver and now of the New York Red Bulls. He replaces the unimpressive Carter-Vickers.60 min: Corner kick to the USA. Trapp delivers, no one’s there, the ball is played back to midfield and awkwardly headed back to Hamid. Again, see the disclaimer, but I’m not sure what Hamid should’ve done differently on the goal other than shove three of his teammates out of the way.Lenihan was the substitute for John O’Shea in the first half, and Ireland have just made another -- Daryl Horgan of Preston North End replaces the possible scorer Burke.Ireland takes the corner kick back 30 yards. The ball is then played into the box, where about five people (mostly American) shelter Bill Hamid from the ball, taking him beyond the post. Lenihan fires into a nearly empty net, but Burke may have gotten the last touch. (And if so, he might have been offside.)56 min: McClean’s cross hits Carter-Vickers in the torso, and the big defender didn’t enjoy that. Corner kick for the home side, and ...55 min: This association football match desperately needs a substitution or four. Funny things found on Twitter: 50 min: Wood causes the Irish backline all sorts of problems. The USA wind up with possession, and they painstakingly work the ball backward to Hamid.49 min: Yellow card. Meh. Tyler Adams and Callum O’Dowda each slide a bit recklessly for a ball at midfield. O’Dowda gets the worst of it, so Adams gets the card.47 min: Wil Trapp fouls Jon Walters, adding more gray hair to the Irish forward’s head. McClean then tries his stepover skills against the unimpressed Yedlin.46 min: And, to the surprise of ESPN, the second half is underway.Big mistakes all the way around the Irish defense, and Wood makes them pay.Want to chat?

Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it in this beautifully balanced pasta sauceFor a few years I was lucky enough to share a flat with two River Cafe chefs, Joe Trivelli and Stevie Parle. They opened my eyes to a new world of Italian cooking. One of the classics, pork loin braised in milk, had always piqued my curiosity. How could curdled milk be a desirable outcome in a dish? Of course, once I had tasted that exquisite sauce, with the milk, citrus and meat juices somehow at once bound and separated, I was hooked.This uses beef mince instead of the usual pork loin to make a quicker, but beautifully flavoured pasta sauce. 2 tbsp olive oil8 thin slices of pancetta, about 50g roughly chopped2 small (or 1 large) white onions, peeled and chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and choppedSalt and black pepper800g beef mince1 tbsp fennel seeds, lightly crushed1 bay leaf1 tbsp rosemary, needles finely chopped250ml white wine½ lemon300ml whole milk200g baby broad beans300g fresh or frozen peas3 handfuls grated parmesan, plus extra to serve500g penne4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilWarm the olive oil in a large, heavy-based pan over a medium heat. Add the pancetta, fry until it begins to colour and release its fat, then add the onion, garlic and a pinch of salt. Fry for a further eight to 10 minutes, until the onions are soft and sweet.Season the beef with plenty of salt and pepper. Turn up the heat under the onion and add the meat, fennel seeds, bay leaf and rosemary. Fry for five minutes, stirring, until the mince is beginning to colour.Add the wine and leave to bubble away until it has reduced by half. Shave the skin off the lemon in long, wide strips, then add to the pan with the lemon juice and the milk, lower the heat and leave to simmer slowly for 30 minutes, until the liquid is reduced and the beef is tender – it may curdle, but don’t worry. Add a splash of water if it begins to look dry.When you’re ready to eat, bring a deep pan of salted water to a boil. Add the broad beans, cook for a minute, then add the peas and blanch both for a minute more, before draining, reserving the boiling water for the pasta.Fold the peas and broad beans into the ragu, remove the bay leaf and lemon peel, and add the grated parmesan.Put the water back on to boil, add the pasta and cook until al dente, then drain, reserving a cup of the cooking liquid. Loosen the pasta with half the extra-virgin olive oil and a few tablespoons of the cooking liquid, and do the same to the ragu sauce. Serve the pasta with the ragu, some extra parmesan and olive oil at the table.This ragu is also delicious made with pork or veal mince, so try the different versions to see which you like best. It also works with short lengths of just-blanched asparagus, while the season is with us.

The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23353f60c42a770b988fa2f2dbebb7a910f39f38/0_185_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=740c4ed71afd27f75a4dfc1c4cf4bcf0","title":"sir martin sorrell wpp s4 capital retirement","story":"Sir Martin Sorrell spent more than three decades building his first empire. He has given himself five years to create his second. Within weeks of being ousted from\u0026nbspWPP, which he built from a small Kent-based maker of wire baskets into the world’s biggest ad\u0026nbspgroup, Sorrell began plotting his\u0026nbspreturn.Last week, he announced the reverse takeover of another small listed vehicle – to be renamed S4 Capital in reference to four generations of the Sorrell family – fronting £40m of his own money to rebuild his empire. Sorrell once said that there was “no way” he would still want to be running a big ad business by the time he hits 78, and he won’t: he will be running a start-up.At 73, and even with a small child, the seemingly indefatigable Sorrell has set himself five years to get big and get out one last time.“He has unfinished business, a grievance, and he wants to prove a point to WPP,” says one ad industry peer. “He has proved he is serious, fronting £40m of his own cash to attract other investors. He has every chance of building something quite interesting over the five-year timeline he has set himself.”Sorrell’s personal financial commitment and track record has attracted £11m more from institutional investors and a further commitment, albeit non-binding, for another £150m to fuel an acquisition spree.The real question is whether Sorrell’s comeback in the twilight years of his business career is a shrewd move. Will hubris get the better of him? “In the space of a few weeks, Sorrell has gone from being the defender of the global ad holding company model he helped create to saying they are not fit for purpose and there is a better way of doing it,” says one detractor.Despite the air of scepticism, there have been plenty of business leaders who have staged successful second acts in later life. Carpet king Lord Harris, founder of Carpetright, left it in 2014 and backed his son in setting up rival Tapi, following an apparent falling-out with management. The 72-year-old has pulled the rug out from under his old company, which has blamed Tapi for some of its problems and recently closed dozens of\u0026nbspstores.Of course, history is also littered with big-name failures. During the turn-of-the-century market mania, four famous business figures led by Archie Norman, now the chair of Marks \u0026amp Spencer, took over a cash shell called Knutsford with the aim of buying a major retailer, but got precisely nowhere.Claire Enders, the founder of Enders Analysis, says that like these other business leaders, whether he succeeds or fails, Sorrell cannot step back: “He cannot change his character and be someone who retires: it is not his way.”Enders points out that in the media industry, gerontocracies are strikingly common: Rupert Murdoch is 87, Liberty Global owner John Malone is 77, serial entrepreneur Barry Diller is 76 and Viacom’s Sumner Redstone, aged 95, is still hanging in there –\u0026nbspalbeit leaning heavily on his daughter Shari.“Sorrell, being 73, is a spring chicken,” says Enders. “What is relevant is that you are as good as your last deal. That is what counts, not age.”With Sorrell’s telephone book, she reckons few would bet against him. “He has fantastic contacts with every major chief executive on the planet: he can get a meeting with anyone,” she says. “If anyone can build a business, he can.”Enders believes that Sorrell may even look to make the ultimate final deal – bidding for parts of the WPP empire that he created, such as data business Kantar.Sorrell has structured the S4 Capital deal to give himself a five-year window – from the point of S4 Capital’s first acquisition – to build the business and make his exit, by which point he is likely to be close to his 79th birthday.Even then Sorrell, who has joked that “I see myself having a heart attack while doing this”, may find it hard to finally ride off into the sunset. “I would be dreadfully bored without it,” he has said, the idea of ever retiring a seemingly improbable prospect.“Only when they shoot me,” he once said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/598629a2778570e49024fed98bb0e0d8c9763f96/0_14_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9413ef305432f518c7b1d55ea6fc18b","title":"credit card spending terms conditions rbs natwest","story":"Get your credit card finances in order or we’ll pull the plug on your plastic!That is the warning to millions of credit card holders from the Royal Bank of ScotlandNatWest group, who are being sent new terms and conditions giving the company the right to “freeze spending” or withdraw it altogether.It says the changes are designed to help customers avoid long-term credit card debt. But one  Money reader tells us that, in her opinion, the leaflets could “cause massive stress” to some.So why is the bank clamping down – and is it a good or bad thing?It says the move is in line with industry-wide new rules introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) designed to help people in “persistent debt”.That means RBS is unlikely to be alone in sending out such warnings.The new terms and conditions, state that if a customer pays more in interest and charges than other amounts owed (ie, purchases, balance transfers, advances etc) over two 18-month periods in a row, “we may freeze spending on your card account”. It says this will be done “to help you focus on starting to reduce your outstanding debt”.It adds that a customer will always be alerted before this happens, and an account would only be frozen or withdrawn “if you’re unable or unwilling to reduce the amount you owe”. These changes took effect from 21 May.RBSNatWest tells us: “We want to help customers pay off their debts” and the changes “will help us to be able to do that”.Meanwhile, one credit card industry expert told Money that the aim of this sort of measure was about “protecting the customer ... so people can’t rack up more debt if they are not managing to pay off the debt they already have”.Some card holders may take the view that they are managing their finances perfectly well and do not need protecting from themselves, particularly if that protection is going to take the form of the card company threatening to pull the plug on their plastic, potentially leaving them high and dry at the supermarket checkout or on holiday.RBS says the changes reflect the new FCA rules, introduced on 1 March this year but which do not fully take effect until 1 September. They will force credit card providers to take a series of steps to help customers who have got into a long-term habit of only making the minimum payment each month – something that can often mask underlying financial difficulties.The regulator says action is needed because more than 3 million UK credit card holders are in persistent debt, typically handing over about £2.50 in interest and charges for every £1 they repay.It comes amid this week’s clampdown on high-cost credit by the FCA, following an 18-month review into bank overdrafts, doorstep loans, catalogue credit and rent-to-own borrowing. It proposed a price cap in the rent-to-own sector, but stepped back from ordering price caps on overdrafts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44c3f852b4b17804b2bab4c3b70b586417e045f3/0_258_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71670905a54d1e29023fdbbe0f34265e","title":"how i spend it mairi frances mckay","story":"When I graduated from university last year I got an 18-month trainee post with Leicester council children’s services. It pays £16,000 a year which is a fraction of the average salary, but compared to my time as a student I feel flush.Until last summer I lived on a food budget of £20 a week and it was a struggle. I’d go to the supermarket late at night when stuff was marked down and eventually I realised that food went further if I made meals from scratch. I learned to order £40-worth of ingredients online and that would last a month. Now I spend £20 a week socialising with colleagues.I’m fortunate in that I still live with my parents. I pay them £300 a month in rent which is not a lot less than a house share would have been, but I get my food and utilities included and don’t have to worry about council tax.I’ve never had this much money in my life, but my budget is still tight. Clothes shopping is usually beyond my means I like good quality so go to H\u0026ampM rather than Primark if I need something. I have a lot of discount cards and vouchers. At university I had a smartphone, but now use a pay-as-you-go Nokia which costs very little. I walk to work which saves on bus fares and I bring my own lunch.We’re lucky in that we live in the inner city in a very vibrant erse area with lots of new restaurants so I can have a relatively cheap night out a couple of times a week.I like spending my money on experiences: our local theatre often does youth tickets for £5, although I’d happily pay £50 for a really good show, and I sometimes travel down to London to the West End. Quite a bit of my money goes on train tickets to visit friends and family. I also have a £300 season ticket for Leicester City and will often use staff discount to go and watch the Leicester Tigers rugby club at about £20 a time.We have always had one family holiday a year, usually in the UK but occasionally to places like the US as a rare treat. Until now my parents have paid for me but I expect that will change now I’m earning. About four times a year I’ll have a weekend away with friends. It’s always within the UK and we’ve become big fans of Airbnb because it’s such good value. I usually budget for £50 a trip, including food and accommodation.I’ve been training myself to swim a mile, but I use the local leisure centre rather than a private gym because it only costs about £5 .I come from a family that’s never had much money and so I’ve always been used to careful budgeting. I’d still live modestly even if I started earning big sums. I’ve never had dreams of the high life. We’re often giving to charity – I have a £15-a-month standing order – and to people on the street because that’s the sort of people we are.I left university with a £40,000 student loan to pay off, but I earn below the repayment threshold. When I’ve finished my training I will be on a salary of about £22,000 which seems like riches to me, but I still be on too little to start repaying.I know I’m lucky to be able to live with my parents and enjoy it, but I would urge to other students graduating with debts and small incomes to make the best of what you have. You can have a good life on very little if you’re careful.As told to Anna Tims"},{"url":null,"title":"alexis petridis music critic guardian q and a","story":"’s head rock and pop critic, and presenter of the Music Weekly podcast, reflects on 17 years in the jobThere’s an oft-trotted-out line that most music journalists are failed musicians, but I’m honestly not. I grew up wanting to be a writer for Smash Hits, not to be on its cover. By the time I was in my early 20s, I really wanted to write specifically about dance music, so I pestered Mixmag for work experience, which turned out to be a far better idea than I thought. It was an independent magazine, and there were a lot of talented people there, but it was a relatively new music scene they were covering, with rules and standards very different from conventional rock music, so everyone was sort of busking it, making it up as they went along, which made it a very good environment to start your career in. I eventually ended up as deputy editor. Then I freelanced for a while, got asked to do some reviews for the  which went down well, and they offered me the (vacant) post of rock critic in 2001.When I started, there were no iPods, no smartphones, broadband was in its infancy, no YouTube, no streaming: everyone knows what kind of impact those things have had on rock and pop music. It was inconceivable that artists would put out an album without sending copies out for review in advance, but that happens virtually every week now. I’ve got completely used to writing first-take reviews, where you only have a few hours to listen to something, formulate your thoughts and write a review. You get the feeling that the music industry wishes music critics would go away – there’s no desire to hear anything other than blanket praise, and they try and exert control in order to get that. But I think good writing about music still has a role. I love the idea that it might introduce readers to something they haven’t heard before – anyone who loves music obviously has an urge to share the music they love with people – although I’m not sure it has that much effect on what music people buy. If anyone listened to what music journalists think, the charts would look very different. But if it’s entertaining, people obviously still want to read it: a strong music feature can outperform everything else on the  website in terms of hits, and the subject doesn’t always have to be a big star. A couple of years ago, I wrote about Marilyn, who had two hit singles 34 years ago, but his story was fascinating, and when the piece came out it was the most-read thing on the  website. First, it exposes you to a phenomenal amount of music, and that, I’m afraid, is about as far as my ambitions for life extended: when I was a kid, I used to daydream about owning every record in the world, and that’s not really left me. I hate feeling ignorant about music, not knowing who an artist is, never having heard a genre. It’s like going to a foreign country and not being able to speak the language. I feel as though I’m somehow lacking. I love the sensation of hearing something for the first time and being absolutely wrongfooted by it, that feeling that you’re listening to something really striking and unprecedented – the first time I heard Dizzee Rascal was like that – or digging up some weird, forgotten bit of musical history. A couple of years ago, there was a piece about radical architecture in Italian discos of the 1970s, architects who’d been inspired by the tumult of 1968, with all these theories about the systematic exploitation of capitalism, and who had designed these insane-looking nightclubs. I find stuff like that fascinating. It’s obviously an incredible privilege to be paid to spend time listening to and thinking about music. Moreover, it seems to continually place me in completely ridiculous, intriguing situations, with extraordinary people. I’ve had my testicles flicked by Marilyn Manson and sat at Prince’s feet while he tried to get me to sing Sign o’ the Times to him. I’ve talked to a student mental health nurse called Millie who spends her evenings throwing entrails around onstage and performing “serial killing snuff grind metal” in a band called Basement Torture Killings. I lead a pretty boring life outside of music, but if your day job involves Marilyn Manson flicking your testicles then you don’t really need to go bungee jumping at the weekend to add colour to your life.For all the technological changes in recent years, I’m not sure that what readers want out of music journalism has actually altered that much at heart. It’s clearly not the same as the days when the music press would write about an album and that would be all fans had to go on for weeks until it was released, but I’m pretty sure they want something entertaining in its own right. It’s not just a consumer guide: at its best, writing about music should engage people regardless of whether they’re interested in the artist being discussed or not. They want something that’s insightful and that brings a degree of wider knowledge to bear on its subject. They want something they either find illuminating or that they can argue with if they disagree: I’d hope that people don’t just want to read stuff that confirms what they already think about an artist. I’m a big believer in the writer Anthony Lane’s line about a review being just the first line of an argument. I somehow didn’t expect to write as many obituaries and posthumous appreciations as I have done in recent years, but in some cases they’ve been the biggest stories I’ve covered: the deaths of Michael Jackson and David Bowie.There’s a really gloomy view that sees the death of artists like Bowie and Prince as symbolic of something bigger, the end of an era when pop music was absolutely central to culture, the means by which everything from fashion to politics was disseminated to a mass youth audience. But a couple of nights ago, I went to see a load of British rappers performing at The Haunt in Brighton. The audience was really young – largely too young to get served at the bar the rappers were pretty underground figures: Loski, SL. The place was going nuts, everyone there knew every word of every track. You see something like that and you think that reports of pop’s lack of relevance to latter-day youth culture might be a bit premature. Or you see how something like Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp A Butterfly completely chimes with the times, seems to sum up the moment that we’re living through and you think. No, music definitely still has the capacity to be potent and important, to really touch people’s lives.

Not only was she nearly run over, having walked out in front of a car assuming it would stop, but now her favourite shop (“They sell the best bowls”) is closed. At one point, after some frantic buzzer-pressing (it’s that kind of place), the owner peers round the door only to tell us to come back in five days, while a FaceTime chat with a friend who might be able to help comes to nothing. It turns out that supermodel Giselle Bündchen paid a visit recently, and this brush with celebrity has made the owner a bit shy. “But I’m nobody,” Li says to the face in her phone. “I’m not famous.”She may not be Giselle famous, but over the course of four albums of emotionally swollen doom-pop, Li has single-mindedly carved out her own lane. While 2008’s debut Youth Novels, featuring whimsical single Little Bit, contained a semblance of untarnished naivety, 2011’s Wounded Rhymes (key song title: Sadness Is a Blessing) and 2014’s claustrophobically downbeat I Never Learn confirmed Li as modern pop’s bruised, goth-leaning moody sister. On the surface, that seems to have changed with this month’s new album, So Sad So Sexy, which sees her work with Malay (Frank Ocean), Skrillex and super-producer and partner Jeff Bhasker, with whom she has a two-year-old son. The result is an album that takes the sounds of hip-hop, R\u0026ampB and trap and scuffs them up via Li’s brand of overblown heartache.After years of rejecting the “pop star” tag – in part, a reaction to being lumped in with every female musician coming out of Sweden – she is now, reluctantly, softening to it. “Being indie is very much being against things,” she says as we try and find a place to chat. “But I’m more open-minded now.” Her first step to pop enlightenment was to strip away the reverb she’d always used on her vocals. Like everything when it comes to Li’s creativity – she’ll later compare music-making to Fitzcarraldo director Werner Herzog’s attempts to pull a 320-tonne steamboat over a mountain in documentary Burden of Dreams – it was a challenge, a state of being she seems to relish.“Jeff really pushed me hard,” she says. “He was like: ‘Take away that reverb, you need to fucking sing.’ It was crazy I was running out of the studio crying every day.” In fact, their relationship, which was being tested at work and at home, became a sort of studio soap opera. “It was a big show for everyone else they’re going to have tons of stories to tell. My new manager said we were the craziest – and he manages Courtney Love.”The “shit” she alludes to started during a break in touring I Never Learn. A sickly person, she ended up cancelling the Australian leg of the jaunt, even turning down a proposed support slot with Rihanna, whose Anti album has influenced So Sad So Sexy. “I’d been on a seven-year cycle of albums, tours, heartbreaks, trying to grow up,” she sighs. “All I wanted was to be in my fucking bed.”She recalls a meeting with Rihanna at a party. “She complimented me on my tits,” she laughs, before adding quickly “but this was before I had the baby. I had a very low-cut top on and she said, ‘Oh, look at you with your titties out.’ I feel like we had some kind of connection.”In a lot of ways, I Never Learn underlined the end of the first chapter of Li’s life she’d always seen those first albums as a trilogy, marking out her 20s, and taking her from the “cocky” Lykke Li of Youth Novels to the “just completely broken and exhausted and, like, fuck my life” shell of I Never Learn. Solace briefly came when she was “pregnant and chilling” in the shape of Liv, a 70s MOR-influenced supergroup of sorts featuring Bhasker, Björn Yttling and Miike Snow’s Andrew Wyatt and Pontus Winnberg, a project that was quickly curtailed by “orces and cats dying and ‘Oh, now I have to go and work with Miley Cyrus’.”She says early motherhood was “psychedelic”, and that it left her feeling “raw, needy, crazy”. Adjacent to the LA musical elite via Bhasker, whose production credits include Uptown Funk, Beyoncé’s 4 and most of Harry Styles’s solo album, she found herself fading into the background. “We’d show up somewhere,” she says, “and I was totally only a baby momma to them. Especially in this town. It becomes a big stigma, like: ‘Oh, you have a baby – OK, bye.’ I was nothing and nobody here, which in some way was really good – to have my ego completely broken, you know? To listen to Frank Ocean and be like: ‘Wow, I’m never going to make an album this good.’ Or, two months after giving birth, watching Lemonade and thinking: ‘I could never … I’m done.”’Did she find it frustrating that Bhasker, who won a Grammy for producer of the year in 2016, was able to continue working immediately? “Yeah, that was like: ‘Wow – the difference between being a man and a woman.’ I was a feminist before, but now it’s next level.” She also initially had problems finding a new manager and record deal (she’s now signed to Sony). “People were like: ‘She’s difficult,’ meaning: ‘She has an opinion, she demands a lot of attention to detail, but she makes no money.’”In July 2017, as the album was taking shape, her mother – who gave her a nomadic upbringing, moving the family from suburban Sweden to a village in Portugal and then back to Stockholm again, via holidays in India – died. Li says So Sad So Sexy carries the weight of the tragedy. “It was like: ‘Woah, wake up, you’re an adult.’”I remind Li of a previous interview, in which she said it was always her mother’s aim that Li be as “un-Swedish as possible”. Does Li think she succeeded? “Yeah, it’s sad, too, because when she got sick she actually did return to Sweden,” she says. “On her death bed she said: ‘Lykke, this is what’s important,’ because when she was there all her friends would come and visit her. I realised that that’s ultimately what you have. I love and miss Sweden so much now.”For the time being, though, she’s happy in LA, drawn, as ever, to its darker side, which even extends to living under President Trump. “It’s a historic moment, so it’s kind of pretty interesting, to be honest,” she says. “You’re in the heat of the fire. It’s completely fucked up, but I have a pretty dystopian view of the world anyway.”As our lunch comes to an end, Li has to rush off to finish editing two music videos. The deadline’s approaching and she’s itching to get them done.“I went to a hypnotist because I have some kind of control thing, and he was like: ‘You’re way worse than I thought – you’re an uber control freak.’” She laughs. “But I’m also a free spirit. I decide what I want to do, and that’s the way it’s going to be. Sometimes people are going to like it and sometimes they won’t.”So Sad So Sexy is out on 8 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbf0ea6052d8e30b0110d82261ddcb0fedde53af/0_390_2205_1323/master/2205.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4c16f900bebb43e7691b85dab46bc38","title":"one to watch benin city last night","story":"Benin City are not a brand new entity: the London trio released an album, Fires in the Park, in 2013. But Last Night, their second full-length work, feels more like a reboot than a follow-up. This time, vocalist Joshua Idehen and multi-instrumentalist Tom Leaper are joined by a second vocalist, Shanaz Dorsett, taking the place of drummer Theo Buckingham. The production is bigger and bolder, with pulsing rave synths on Final Form signalling their ruckus-bringing intentions from the outset.The album was conceived in response to the slow death of London’s club scene, as evidenced by the closure in recent years of such cherished haunts as Plastic People and Passing Clouds. “Those places, and the stories they held, are gone for good as London becomes pricier and ever more grey,” Idehen has said. If Last Night doesn’t exactly feel like an elegy, it has much to do with Idehen’s versatility as a vocalist (he also performs as a slam poet) and the restless energy he channels on Take Me There, the bug-eyed opener, and Bus, tracking one far-from-sober journey home on the N38.Even as Idehen rages against gentrification on All Smoke, No Fire – “Your croissants is in my caff bro,” he spits over menacing trap beats – the trio sound energised rather than deflated by their central theme. Benin City come across as the perfect companions for a boisterous, richly textured night out, even if, in London at least, such nights are in danger of becoming a thing of the past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b14f7e24023fda42f7a17ec5ccdd84a66ed50ff8/0_48_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c966ce7265032097363384c483e16571","title":"ye kanye west review self righteous soulful shocking","story":"When Chuck D of Public Enemy described hip-hop as “CNN for black culture”, he probably did not expect to see the antics of famous rappers become such a fixture of the wider news cycle. And yet Ye – the eighth studio album by Kanye West – finds the controversial rapper in candid, unrepentant form, making the news once again.Over a brief seven tracks, the 40-year-old superstar confirms his production prowess, veering between sparse, hyper-modern styles and compositions which hark back to the soulful bent of the producer-turned-rapper’s early career a volatile mix of the sweet and the acrid, the sentimental and the tendentious.Lyrically, he is less easy to defend. “I don’t take advice from people less successful than me,” sneers West, the lofty self-made millionaire, on Make No Mistake – a song whose buttery first verse and chorus (sung by Charlie Wilson and Kid Cudi) curdles into a series of self-righteous outbursts.Much of Ye – Kanye’s nickname – feels raw, personal and up-to-the-minute, the album cover-shot having been taken on an iPhone as a private listening party and album streaming session was being set up last Thursday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Yikes – one of the best tracks, musically – bounces and swings, as West raps through an entire pharmacy of drug references, harking back to the episode last year which found him hospitalised for exhaustion: “on meds, off meds.” If there is a valuable seam of wisdom on this record, it is the fear of legal opioids, the prescription medication implicated in the deaths of Prince, Michael Jackson and countless others.On Wouldn’t Leave, another track with a superficially twinkly mien, West raps about the furore unleashed just a few weeks ago when he implied that 400 years of African-American slavery was “a choice” rather than enforced bondage. “I said slavery a choiceThey said ‘How ’Ye’Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day.” The track also provides a telling snapshot of the aftermath. “My wife callin’, screamin’Sayin’ we ’bout lose it all.”There is plenty of love for TV personality Kim Kardashian here, as well as worry for the couple’s elder daughter. The closing track, Violent Crimes, finds West despairing at male-kind (“N****s is savage”) and hoping that four-year-old North grows up to be strong like Nicki Minaj. The closing voicemail message confirms that Minajco-wrote some of the lyrics.The pseudo-feminism West directs towards his closest female relatives is not enough, however, to claw back sympathy for an increasingly isive artist whose support for Bill Cosby (recently found guilty of aggravated indecent assault) has added to the dismay swirling around the star. West expends plenty of couplets on Ye extolling his preferences for “girls that’s basic”, alluding to indiscretions and boasting of how often he has paid for women to have implant surgery.Obnoxiousness comes easily to West, whose apparent support for Donald Trump has recently bewildered a significant part of his fanbase. The ability to shock as well as awe has, however, long been part of the rapper’s appeal. That Ye also finds Kanye West homicidal, suicidal (all on one track, I Thought About Killing You), fatherly and able to produce music of a high calibre confirms this isive figure is, at least, consistent in his wilfulness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0927bb150b128ceea9ac7a7f4c9e8a549c509e63/0_125_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57962b7fbf3c0921ad61e15959de4a01","title":"david miliband i would join any campaign against any brexit deal","story":"The former foreign secretary says there should be a second vote on BrexitDavid Miliband has said he would take part in any campaign to vote against the terms of any Brexit deal but has no plans to return to the cut and thrust of UK politics.Miliband, who has been based in New York as president of the International Rescue Committee (IRC) since 2013, is still seen as a future leader of the Labour party and has never categorically ruled it out.He was asked at the Hay literary festival in Wales whether, if there was ever a public vote on the terms of a Brexit deal, he would be part of a campaign to reject it. “Of course,” he said. “I tried to campaign last time, I hope I’d campaign more effectively next time.”Miliband, the former foreign secretary, said it was important to him to be in a job where he could make the most impact.The 17,000 people working for the IRC also needed to know, he said, that he was focused “on doing my job today for them”.Miliband argues there should be a second vote on Brexit, partly on the grounds that what people voted for is not going to happen.He said the first referendum should not have taken place and reminded the Hay audience that it was Margaret Thatcher, quoting Clement Attlee, who said a referendum was a device used by “dictators and demagogues”.The remain campaign leading up to the 2016 vote was a flawed one. “David Cameron became the leading cheerleader of the remain side, but he had spent the previous 20 years attacking the European Union,” said Miliband.He said the government, 780 days after the vote, still had no policy on trade, regulation or market access. “The negotiations to unscramble the eggs of social, of economic, of environmental integration with Europe are going to go on for five or 10 years.”Miliband said Brexit was squeezing the life out of politics in the UK and preventing “the social and economic reform we desperately need”.He criticised Theresa May for not setting up a cross-party coalition to campaign to get the best outcome for the UK but also said it was not enough for the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to stand aside and “let events take their course.”Miliband was asked about accusations of antisemitism in the Labour party – the “purest and oldest and most disgusting” example of racism, he said – and called on people to stay and fight. “It completely grieves me,” he said. “I never believed I would see the day when antisemitism and the Labour party were in the same sentence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e274792cb07b3f3d3ac8ef01c1549431ffc4f16/29_184_4312_2589/master/4312.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98f25a537e50236aae66337ef1a51616","title":"replace theresa may with michael gove tory donor says brexit uk news","story":"Government should be bolder in talks with Brussels, Leave campaign backer claimsMichael Gove should be installed as the new Tory leader because Theresa May has shown that she cannot “carry Brexit through”, a major party donor has publicly warned.In a stark sign of the frustration among prominent Brexit supporters over the government’s handling of negotiations with the EU, Crispin Odey, a hedge fund manager who backed the Leave campaign, said he believed the environment secretary had the skills to make a success of Britain’s exit and appeal to voters.Odey, whose most recent donation to the Conservative party was a £50,000 gift before last year’s general election, said the government needed to be far bolder in its attitude to Brussels. It should be learning from the new Italian populist coalition government, which has plans that would defy EU rules on debt, he said, suggesting that Britain should start breaching EU rules by pursuing policies such as signing trade deals. He also backed a change in leadership.“We’ve got to have that self-confidence to make breaches,” he told the Observer. “There’s no point in voting for freedom if you don’t know what to do when you’re free. What is true is that you have a whole lot of people who didn’t want this to happen who are in charge of it happening.“I would go to Gove. He’s the only minister who is still being a minister. Michael has got lots of attributes that make him a non-traditional Tory. He is very aware that he has to appeal not just to the wealthy, but also more broadly. I don’t think May can carry Brexit through any more.”He added: “Italy has confronted the EU – they’ve said they will go ahead and be in breach of its rules.“We should say, ‘we’ve got to have life after this, so we’re creating that life. We are creating trade agreements which are in breach of everything, because we won’t be in breach by the time you come to take us to court’. That’s how Elizabeth I would have been leading with this.”His backing for Gove risks reigniting the Tory debate about May’s leadership, with some Brexiters worried that Britain could end up being locked into a customs union with the EU that would prevent it pursuing an independent trade policy. In reality, few Tory MPs want an unpredictable leadership election which could further destabilise the party. However, a challenge to May’s leadership could emerge should pro-Brexit MPs conclude there is a better alternative.Gove was one of the figureheads of the successful Vote Leave campaign. His botched attempt to succeed David Cameron in 2016 saw him widely condemned by Tory MPs for betraying Boris Johnson, whose leadership bid he had been supporting. He was then sacked from the frontbench by May. However, he has been enjoying something of a renaissance since returning to the cabinet as environment secretary last year. “No other politician could have made such an impact in that job,” said an ally.A source close to Gove said the environment secretary was “fully supportive of the prime minister and will continue to be so”. He added: “He believes it’s vital we get behind our prime minister to deliver the Brexit 17.4 million people voted for.”Odey, who has also donated to Ukip in the past, said he believed that May was a gifted technocrat, but questioned her handling of Brexit. “The European Union are not good at hitting a moving ball,” he said. “The problem is, Theresa May is not good at hitting a moving ball, either.“As someone said about May, she should have joined the civil service, rather than becoming a politician. She is perfect for that, but she can’t make a decision. So there is no leadership.“We should be reaching out to Italy. We should be saying that we have so many of the same problems.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4898d2b5a835f53b8c937fb48e8aecd9ffd651e/40_110_3368_2022/master/3368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ef0fb7146b3e50dbc09d994af1b3aef","title":"activists call for end to ban on gay marriage in northern ireland","story":"Demonstrators say the voting mechanism blocking legislative change must be reformedSame-sex marriage campaigners have insisted that any deal to restore power-sharing in Stormont must include an end to the ban on gay marriage in Northern Ireland. Thousands of activists marched through Belfast to demand the reform of a controversial voting mechanism that has blocked the law change. Demonstrators said they would not support a revived power-sharing executive if it was not accompanied by a radical overhaul of the petition of concern (PoC).Up to 20,000 people, including former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams, joined the protest on Saturday, according to Amnesty International. They chanted, “Change is on the way” and “You can’t stop change” outside Belfast city hall.A majority of MLAs backed the introduction of same-sex marriage the last time it was debated on the floor of the assembly before the institutions collapsed almost 18 months ago, but the use of the PoC by the Democratic Unionists rendered that irrelevant.The petition is designed to protect minority views in a post-conflict society. It means a proposal can only be passed in the assembly if a majority of unionists and a majority of nationalist MLAs support it, rather than a straightforward majority head count.The DUP is not the only party accused of abusing the mechanism. Rivals have been criticised for deploying it on other issues that many claim have little to do with protecting minority rights.The party has also said it is willing to scrap the petition entirely if others, including Sinn Féin, agree.John O’Doherty, an activist with the Love Equality coalition campaigning for a law change, told the rally that any future deal between the DUP and Sinn Féin needed to include reform of the PoC. In a blunt message to the prime minister, Theresa May, and the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, he said human rights “could not be based on postcodes”. The UK government has come under pressure to legislate on the issue in the absence of power-sharing.Labour MP Conor McGinn, who failed in a recent bid to change the law through a private member’s bill at Westminster, warned May: “The message from the thousands here today in Belfast is loud and clear. “We are on the right side of history. We will not give up. This is not going away. And we are going to win.” Actor Bronagh Waugh called on May to “deliver on the promise of equality”. “It is unacceptable that your government is now colluding in the denial of human rights to people in Northern Ireland. We are not second-class citizens.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dd3e78403ab8bd2b68a74f7dbb596df4d80ceec/0_446_6000_3601/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=445cc95fabb8716f2a9b176bfab9f277","title":"doreen lawrence grenfell tenants faced institutional indifference","story":"Doreen Lawrence has attacked the “institutional indifference” faced by the residents of Grenfell Tower and others living in social housing.The campaigner, whose son, Stephen Lawrence, was murdered in a racist attack in 1993, writes in the Observer that the indifference of the authorities to Grenfell residents meant “they had no right to safety and no right to be heard”.She adds: “Very few people in positions of power understand what this experience is like. I doubt they’ve ever had to live in poor housing or know what it is like to feel invisible, like no\u0026nbspone cares.”Baroness Lawrence fought for years against a discriminatory and complacent police response to her son’s murder. In 1999, a public inquiry concluded that the police were institutionally racist, in a report which was expected to reset race relations in Britain.Now Lawrence has drawn a “striking parallel” between that inquiry and the public inquiry into the Grenfell fire, which is due to begin hearing evidence this week. In both inquiries, she says, “race and class play an undeniable part”.For the past two weeks, relatives of the 72 people who died as a result of the fire have been giving testimony in a preliminary session of the inquiry. In the presence of Sir Martin Moore-Bick, the chair, painful accounts of the lives of those who died have reduced many to tears.Lawrence says she has “listened intently” to the heartbreaking stories. “I understand acutely the pain of those speaking out about their loss. Sitting in a public inquiry day after day, talking about your own grief while the world watches, is a very difficult thing to do. I know it really took its toll on me.“But these people are doing something essential: they are finally putting names, faces, hopes and dreams to the 72 victims who, until now, have otherwise been a number. For that bravery and truth, we are all grateful.”She commends the relatives for harnessing their anger, saying: “It was the same for me when I was fighting for justice for my son Stephen, after he was murdered. My anger became my motivation it kept me driving forwards for years.”The institutional indifference faced by the Grenfell Tower community spreads to all residents of social housing, she says. “It’s the same indifference which too often sees dismissive landlords protected by a system that allows them to ignore social tenants’ fears and concerns.”Stigma towards social tenants is “still very much alive and well, and it’s the main reason these tenants can end up being ignored”.Recalling her own years in social housing, she says: “We need to look again at the basic deal which those who need social housing are offered. A social home should be a home and an opportunity to get on – as I did – and somehow we have lost sight of that.”Lawrence is serving on a commission established by the homelessness charity Shelter to scrutinise the state and role of social housing in the aftermath of the fire. The panel includes Edward Daffarn, a resident of the tower, whose blog predicted a catastrophic fire Ed Miliband, the former Labour party leader and the Conservative peer Sayeeda Warsi.Chaired by Mike Long, the minister of the Notting Hill Methodist church, close to the tower, the commission’s recommendations are expected to be presented to the prime minister before the end of the year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9403cef1235a1216b31a9eebb1511d869b33a83/0_82_3185_1911/master/3185.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2507d9798e035fdb2e9ce5db92688352","title":"cricket england pakistan second test match report","story":"• Second Test, day two: Pakistan 174 England 302-7• Bess top-scores with 49 as hosts take complete controlEngland ended a rain-shortened day in a dominant position on 302 for seven, even if they got there by an unusual route. When the sun finally made an appearance in the last session, the home team’s lead had been extended to 128 runs with three wickets remaining. Yet not a single batsman managed to post a half-century, the highest score being Dom Bess’s 49 in his first role as a nightwatchman.The highest Test score achieved without a batsman hitting 50 is 315, made by England in Trinidad in 1986 – though on that occasion the extras tally went beyond 50. Here the bowling was not so terrifying as that of the West Indians of that era and, unlike the match at the Queen’s Park Oval, England have a very good chance of winning at Headingley. Pakistan were frustrated on Saturday but only by a sequence of little partnerships.Joe Root and Bess had added another 32 together before England’s captain was caught behind. Mohammad Amir had passed his outside edge several times, eliciting an impish, eloquent grin from Root, which seemed to say: “A fine delivery, my good man but this is Headingley and I’m still here”. However, there were no smiles when he feathered an attempted cover drive off Amir.Root had given the impression that he was enjoying batting with Bess they scurried between the wickets mischievously, stealing singles, provoking overthrows and then smiling at one another between overs. No doubt Bess was on cloud nine to be batting with his captain while Root may have seen a glimpse of his own youth in the fearless zest of his young partner. They were not at work, but at play.When Dawid Malan joined Bess it was far from obvious who was the nightwatchman. In between the odd sweetly timed boundary, Bess was easily knocking the ball wide of mid-on for another single. Of course he is a bit of a fraud as a nightwatchman. Consider some of his predecessors – Jimmy Anderson, Matthew Hoggard, Pat Pocock and Derek Underwood – and we can admire their bravery under fire rather than the felicity of their strokeplay. Bess is in a different league to these doughty souls – as a batsman.After this impressive start to his Test career, the 20-year-old Bess is in danger of becoming another English spinner who is actually a better batsman than bowler. For the moment we can only conclude that he is a damn fine cricketer, who has that rare and wondrous capacity to enjoy himself out there without feeling any of the burdens that usually come with the intense scrutiny of a Test match. Bess’s batting is based on sound orthodoxy. He goes back, rather than across, as the bowler hits his delivery stride, but he does this rhythmically enough to get forward if necessary he scores freely square on the off side and likes to cover-drive. Occasionally he innovated once he walked down the pitch to Mohammad Abbas and nonchalantly clipped the ball through midwicket for three. At the other end Malan must have been impressed since he immediately wandered down the pitch himself before delivering a crisp straight drive, a sincere form of flattery from the older man.This was an important knock for Malan, whose most significant innings in Test cricket have been in Australia. He averages only 20 in England and his status is slipping. He started scratchily but his stiff-armed strokeplay began to bear fruit he deftly deflected leg-breaks from Shadab Khan in between the odd drive to the boundary off the pacemen. But he could not deliver a major innings. Amir was recalled after tea and his first ball bounced surprisingly Malan prodded and could only fend the ball to first slip.Meanwhile, Bess’s burgeoning reputation as a batsman was reflected by the fact Pakistan wasted a review against him when Amir struck a pad. Soon afterwards, when he needed just a single to record his second Test fifty, Bess edged a high-bouncing leg-break to slip, where Asad Shafiq held a fine catch.So there was the tantalising combination of Jonny Bairstow and Jos Buttler in harness, an alliance that was bound to keep bums on seats all around the ground. Their partnership flickered to the tune of 48 runs but, just before the new ball was due, Bairstow edged a fine delivery from Faheem Ashraf to the keeper.Buttler remained and was threatening after his rapid start. He hit three consecutive fours off Shadab, the second of which passed through the hands of Hasan Ali at midwicket. Soon afterwards Buttler was hit on the head by a Hasan bouncer but otherwise there were no dramas for him. In fact he played with commendable restraint against the seamers armed with the new ball.The Buttler experiment is looking very promising and worthwhile. We are witnessing him rediscovering how to play red-ball cricket in a Test match. Not many cricketers could contemplate doing that but such is his talent there is an increasingly good chance it might work. Whatever the outcome it is beguiling to watch this experiment unfold. He looked a class act as he ended up unbeaten on 34. Perhaps he can be the man to post that elusive half-century in this innings. Sam Curran, who in his first Test innings crunched two eye-catching boundaries in the final over, may have the same ambition."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bc67fbc9e59e1b57c8e03ad5d5a4e661c7e7079/345_15_4131_2480/master/4131.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=785755edff1d6dfa2cbf904847341cbb","title":"mako vunipola england south africa tour","story":"A year ago this weekend Mako Vunipola was on the Lions’ bench for the opening match of their New Zealand tour and was pressed into action nine minutes into the second half to head off the prospect of an unthinkable defeat by a side scavenged from the lower reaches of the professional game in the land of the World Cup holders. The England prop has made 35 appearances since then and, in an age when player welfare is talked about constantly, he should be resting his feet somewhere unspoiled by rugby posts.He duly boarded a plane this weekend, on tour but not a tourist. His campaign has another month to run with England, in need of redemption in South Africa for a three-Test series after slumping to fifth in the Six Nations and conceding 63 points to the Barbarians last Sunday. And so Vunipola – who had two rest weekends last season, one at the beginning – trudges on, not that the 27-year-old is complaining.“I did not have the best pre-season and had a slow start with Saracens, understandably, but the year has been OK,” says Vunipola, the man of the match last weekend when Saracens defeated Exeter at Twickenham to reclaim the Premiership title. “What has pleased me the most is being involved and having the opportunity to play so many games.

It was not so much that I felt my tank was getting low but the disappointment at losing matches. It was hard to lift myself going back to Saracens and the transition back to club rugby was tough. We talked about it as a group of players and looked on it as an opportunity to get better which, I think, we did.”Vunipola played at the end of the season as if it were the beginning and was named the man of the match in the semi-final victory over Wasps and in the final when, in 30C heat, he lasted 75 minutes and covered more ground with the ball in hand than any other forward and made 18 tackles.His scrummaging, once perceived as a weakness that would stunt his international growth, has improved as the importance of the set piece has diminished. But his value lies in his contribution in the loose, where he acts like an extra back-row forward.“I would have given myself a seven out of 10 in the play-off matches,” he says. “I could have done better in one or two scrums and at times got back into the game quicker but overall it was pretty pleasing.”When it is put to him that he made the game look easy with his perpetual motion and constant involvement, he replies: “It is not. I am fortunate to have great team-mates. I just push hard in the scrum and whatever comes after that is a bonus.”There is likely to be some scrum pushing in South Africa, one of the few countries who still regard the set piece as something more than cosmetic. They have recalled Bismarck du Plessis, who was in South Africa’s World Cup-winning squad in 2007, when Eddie Jones was a consultant for the Springboks, while a survivor from the 2009 series victory over the Lions, Tendai Mtawarira, is approaching 100 caps at loosehead prop.“South Africans pride themselves on how physical they are,” says Vunipola. “That will be the first and foremost challenge for us as a team. They are a very emotional people who wear their hearts on their sleeves and we know we are going to have to be ready in the opening 20 minutes of the first Test when, with a new coach and a new team, they will come out with guns blazing.“I am fortunate at Saracens to have played alongside some great South Africans. They are the nicest people off the field but on it they will do everything to intimidate you and gain the upper hand. Schalk Brits and Schalk Burger have given me a few hints about what to watch out for, and they epitomise how rugby there is played: it is scary some of the things they can do, skilful but first and foremost they want to hurt you with massive tackles.”Vunipola will take his body into the fray for a final month before getting July off but, when he returns, he faces more than 13 months of rugby, with the World Cup in Japan looming in September next year. “When I was younger, I did not realise how much effort you have to put in at the start of a week to get yourself right,” he says. “As I’ve got older, I know my body better and what I need to do. I never go up to the coaches and say I am not quite up to it today because I would feel guilty watching other players work. I just enjoy playing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de4fd4b42309ad44898e004c62c885712d225d68/0_49_1936_1162/master/1936.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e8e5817e4872231c994e6f9029ff108","title":"maria sharapova blows away pliskova to lay down french open marker","story":"The cold war is over. Serena Williams, husbanding as much diplomatic warmth as she deemed appropriate, inferred strongly before her blockbuster match here on Monday against Maria Sharapova that her Russian rival had been indulging in fake news.Williams on Saturday beat Julia Görges 6-3, 6-4 to go through to the fourth round, not long after Sharapova had blitzed the sixth seed, Karolina Pliskova, 6-2, 6-1 in under an hour. Later, after batting away a couple of innocuous questions about her daughter, Olympia, Williams was confronted with a 14-year-old remark by Donald Trump that “Maria’s shoulders were incredibly alluring and ... you were intimidated by her supermodel good looks”. Pausing, she replied: “I can’t say I have been intimidated by anyone.”That became blindingly apparent as she opened up both barrels, ever so quietly. “We are both on a comeback for two totally different reasons. She’s been on her journey for over a year and I just started mine a couple months ago. It’s something new and different. I don’t know what else to say.”Yes, she did. Asked about passages in Sharapova’s recent book in which she intimated the reason Williams has dominated the Russian in 19 of their 21 matches over 14 years was because Williams was so distraught at losing to her in the 2004 Wimbledon final she cried in the locker room, Williams looked surprised.“It would be more shocking if I wasn’t in tears. I do have emotions and I wear them on my sleeve. I’m human. What happens there should definitely maybe stay there and not necessarily talk about it in a not‑so‑positive way in a book.”On Monday’s fourth-round match – the most anticipated of the tournament – she said: “Quite frankly, she’s probably a favourite. She’s been playing for over a year now. I just started. I’m just trying to get my bearings. This will be another test. This is one of her best surfaces, and she always does really, really well here.” Except when playing Williams, to whom she lost in the 2013 final.She continued: “I don’t have any negative feelings towards her. It was a little disappointing to see in that hearsay book. Especially having a daughter, I feel negativity is taught. Women, especially, should bring each other up.“A lot of people always assume that I feel a different way and it’s not true. You know, if anything, I feel like we should encourage each other and the success of one female should be the inspiration to another. I have said that a thousand times. I always get inspired by other women that are doing well.“Before her incident of drugs or not, I just feel she was doing good. Now she’s doing well again, and I have never had any hard feelings toward her. Whenever I play her, obviously I go out there the way I play everyone else. I go extremely hard. I don’t play anyone different. I play everyone so hard because they play me really hard, and I always have to be ready for it.“As a fan, I was really excited for it to come out and I was really happy for her. And then the book was a lot about me. I was surprised about that, to be honest. I didn’t expect to be reading a book about me that wasn’t necessarily true. I didn’t know she looked up to me that much or was so involved in my career.Without abusing the metaphor, Williams had the ultimate cornerman on court in Mike Tyson, who was there cheering for her on Saturday evening. “Seeing him there is always pretty cool. He was obviously such a great champion.”Whatever the verbal heat generated, Williams is probably right in her assessment of her next match. It would be one of her best career triumphs to overcome Sharapova again, at 36 and in the early stages of her comeback. For Sharapova, losing would be another devastating blow – and might underpin her extraordinary will to win against all odds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c34dae6db888188078187da7c7e25437f9156f1/0_161_3478_2087/master/3478.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e7198c7b0486f51ccb1d456be6948a1","title":"mo farah jama aden doping genzebe dibaba","story":"• Prosecutors target Farah’s former ‘unofficial facilitator’• Report accuses coach of putting health of athletes at riskJama Aden, the coach who guided Genzebe Dibaba to the 1500m world record and worked as an “unofficial facilitator” with Mo Farah when he trained in Ethiopia, could face up to four and a half years in prison if found guilty of alleged doping offences, according to reports.The Spanish paper El País said it has seen the prosecutor’s report on Aden, which accuses the British-Somali coach of putting the health of his elite athletes at risk by providing them with up to eight types of substances and medications to improve their performance.The news follows police raids in June 2016 on several premises in the Catalonian town of Sabadell where Aden and his athletes were staying. Six doctors from the IAAF, athletics’ world governing body – which had been monitoring Aden for three years – and officials from the Spanish Anti-Doping Agency found different types of the banned drug EPO and 19 syringes preloaded and ready to use.While none of Aden’s athletes who were present subsequently tested positive for banned substances he has been under investigation ever since. El País’s report says the prosecutor’s report concludes the trainer did provide his athletes with substances prohibited in sport in Spain and “medicines that did not have the administrative authorisation” to be marketed in Spain and that, therefore, were “absolutely clandestine”.Although no trial date has been set, prosecutors want the maximum penalty for Aden and his trusted physiotherapist, Ouarid Mounir, although whether they are able to extradite Aden from Qatar, where he is now based, is another story.In 2016, British Athletics confirmed Aden had only ever been an “unofficial facilitator” for Farah for a week when he trained in Ethiopia in 2015 with his duties limited to shouting out times as Farah ran laps round the track in the Ethiopian town of Sululta.A spokesman for British Athletics said Aden had helped Farah when the performance director, Neil Black, and the head of endurance, Barry Fudge, were not around, and they had subsequently changed their rules.Farah was also photographed with Aden in February 2016 when he trained alongside some of the Somali’s athletes at another camp in Ethiopia. “All Aden did, for a very short period of time, was to hold a stopwatch and shout out times to athletes as they completed their track sessions,” the spokesman added. “There was no coaching or anything technical involved.”In 2016, a spokesperson for Farah said: “Jama has nothing to do with Mo as an athlete or his training. But occasionally they are in the same place at a track for a training session alongside many other athletes and coaches from across the world. Mo is always with a British Athletics person and of course they will speak to him and be courteous if they bump in to each other but Jama has no input into Mo’s training whatsoever.”In a statement to the Observer the Athletics Integrity said it had noted the El País report. “The AIU has been in close contact with the Spanish authorities from the outset of this matter,” it said. “We will continue to monitor the proceedings and take any action necessary to protect the integrity of athletics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75402fcc1b35366c9c8025f95aeafb656711f2ac/114_0_2387_1433/master/2387.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c2cb26ba2c2eb2a34c21b833054abab","title":"summer blow away mists european rugby","story":"Maro Itoje was in reflective mood as he sprawled himself in a chair that struggled to contain his 6ft 6in frame at England’s Bagshot base. “I have been in camp for only two days but you get the feeling something big is about to happen,” said the Lions and Saracens second‑row before Eddie Jones’s squad flew out to South Africa.He was talking about England’s odyssey but his words apply also to international rugby’s changing landscape. The last World Cup not only saw England become the first hosts to fail to make the knockout stage but, for the first time, the semi-finalists all came from the southern hemisphere: in the last eight Argentina knocked out Ireland, South Africa outmuscled Wales, New Zealand overran France and Australia pipped Scotland after being awarded a controversial late\u0026nbsppenalty.Mist settled on the game in Europe and the 2016 Six Nations was a dull, understated affair in which England secured the slam without doing anything grand.Fast forward a couple of years and Ireland and England are second and third in the world rankings, respectively, behind New Zealand. The three countries have comfortably the best records since the last World Cup while three of the 2015 semi-finalists have won 29 Tests between them and lost 45.More than that, Australian rugby seems locked in an existential crisis, short of money, supporters and relevance in a country where large swaths of the population are untouched by it. South Africa, meanwhile, has reacted to two years of precipitous decline by luring Rassie Erasmus from Munster and loosening the restrictions on overseas-based players for the series against England. Then there is Argentina: stuck in the losing habit, although the Jaguares are making an impact in Super Rugby.All three countries have lost players to clubs in England, France and Japan. All the 34 players named in Australia’s squad for this month’s three matches against the Six Nations champions Ireland play for one of the country’s four Super Rugby franchises while Erasmus has called on five Europe-based players, including the Sale scrum-half Faf de Klerk and the Wasps full-back Willie le Roux. Argentina, like New Zealand, do not consider anyone who is based outside their country.The only one of the old Five Nations countries that has had more defeats than victories since the start of 2016 is France, whose summer treat is three Tests against the All Blacks. They last won in New Zealand in 2009 and were the last team to defeat the All Blacks at Eden Park, in the last full year of amateurism. But France’s away record in the Six Nations decade has been wretched, with successes in only Scotland and Italy in the past six\u0026nbspyears.New Zealand still lead the world’s rankings by a distance but they have lost three matches since retaining the World Cup and drew last year’s Lions series. At the start of 2018 their main challengers for the World Cup were seen as England, who in the first two years under Jones found various ways of winning. A slump at the end of this year’s Six Nations prompted suggestions of the emperor’s new clothes, given that the head coach was relying on largely the same group of players who had been involved under his predecessor, Stuart Lancaster, and they are seen as vulnerable this summer in South Africa.The unity between club and country dissolved this past week when the Bath owner, Bruce Craig, hit out after another one of his players, the prop Beno Obano, suffered a long-term injury while training with England. Instead of asking why Jones felt the need to push his players in training, Craig trotted out the old line about players being employed by him and his fellow owners – clubs who this season bombed in Europe, yet to embrace the faster, more fluid approach, based on the breakdown rather than set pieces, that is colouring the game at international and European Champions Cup level.Craig, whose club were run ragged in front of their supporters by the Scarlets in Europe earlier this year, would be better off seeking closer contact between England and the Premiership clubs, aligning training methods so that players have less of a leap to make to international level. There is a far higher degree of cooperation in Ireland, even if it is led from the top, and they have swept all before them this year at Test and club level.Ireland’s record in Australia is not especially impressive: three victories in 13 Tests, the last win coming in 1979. But they have to expect to win this month’s series and not just because of Australia’s mediocre recent record, although the Wallabies did beat New Zealand last year. Ireland have won their last 12 Tests and, having blooded a number of young players, should be a team with their best days ahead of them. Joe Schmidt has kept his players on a tighter rein than he would have had he been in charge of his native New Zealand and it will be interesting to see how much more slack he allows, given the direction of the game as the World Cup looms.Wales, who have two Tests in Argentina after Saturday’s warm-up with South Africa in Washington DC, are trying to be unstructured, if not to the extent of Scotland whose summer consists of matches against Canada, the USA and Argentina.The most intriguing series promises to be in South Africa, a country where wounded prey tend not to survive for long. The Springboks have been awful for too long and they have a long way to climb under Erasmus whose opposite number is under pressure for the first time.Jones has continually separated the jurisdictions of club and country, saying he was responsible for only the latter and had no influence over the former. It explained his tart response to Craig’s outburst but, as long as the two run on parallel lines, New Zealand will likely remain at a distance. Something big will happen only when the English game asks itself what it wants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ce60288cd36a3fe7895dbe2a6f2a09822bd0c5c/0_14_3556_2134/master/3556.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af5598e42b89d6fbea7205dc5c33520a","title":"us national spelling bee facial expressions in pictures","story":"Competitors in the Scripps National Spelling Bee often struggle to contain their emotions when asked to spell obscure or complicated words.

And then another, straight drive off a swinging yorker. To paraphrase Frank Keating (I think) on the young Mike Atherton, he looks like the butcher’s boy and plays like a prince. And that’s stumps, with England leading by 128. Nobody has made 50, and for once it’s a strength: everyone has contributed. Pakistan bowled very well at times, but they are going to need a big third innings tomorrow to turn this match and win the series on a pitch that is offering the bowlers uneven bounce as well as movement. Thanks for your company and some highly entertaining emails. The last word goes to Mac Millings: “I can’t remember what happened with the bleach. Is that a bad sign?” 95th over: England 294-7 (Buttler 34, Curran 8) Curran, facing Abbas, brings out the Harrow drive again and gets four to extremely fine leg. There’s a children’s book in this: Sam and the Magic Inside Edge. Then he goes and spoils it with a firm push into the covers for his first middled run in Tests.“My first Test ground was Lord’s,” says Mac Millings, “although my first match there wasn’t a Test – it was the 1983 World Cup final. First Test was the Saturday at Lord’s in ‘84. Saw Botham mop up the Windies (to end with 8-103), and England stride to a lead of around 150, with 6 wickets in hand and Lamb and Botham looking set for big scores. I left the ground with the series looking likely to be 1-1 after two Tests, and turn into a battle for the ages. I didn’t check back afterwards - any idea how it went?” Nice line, but what we really want to know is, did you deal with the bleach?94th over: England 289-7 (Buttler 34, Curran 3) Another inside edge, respectably thick, off Hasan. While hitting the ball with one edge, Curran is managing to miss with the other. He has middled a few, but always straight to someone in the ring.93rd over: England 288-7 (Buttler 34, Curran 2) Abbas continues, and this time Curran scrapes a single from a Harrow drive, so every one of his Test runs has come off the inside edge. But David Lloyd likes the look of him: “I think he could be a good batsman, this lad.”92nd over: England 287-7 (Buttler 34, Curran 1) Hasan replaces Amir, and Curran picks up his first Test run with a thick inside edge behind square. The crowd still sound merrily bored. Maybe it’s too late in the day.91st over: England 285-7 (Buttler 33, Curran 0) Sam Curran starts by mixing earnest defence with the odd leave, but can’t do much about a typical Abbas ball, leaving him in the corridor, or one that keeps low, so he misses both. I wonder how Curran will spend the last night of his teens. Reading The Rachel Papers, ideally. 90th over: England 285-7 (Buttler 33, Curran 0) Amir keeps Buttler quiet, and Buttler doesn’t seem to mind leaving the whole of the next over to Curran.89th over: England 285-7 (Buttler 33, Curran 0) So it’s goodnight Chris Woakes, and hello Sam Curran, who gets to bat for England in his teens – he turns 20 tomorrow. And Jos Buttler finds himself batting with a fresh-faced debutant for the second time in a week.“Good evening again, Tim.” Simon McMahon brings back the comma. “I would’ve been about 18 months when you first went to Lord’s. You’re not my dad, are you?”A classic jaffa from Abbas, and Woakes does well to nick it, Nasser reckons.88th over: England 284-6 (Buttler 32, Woakes 17) Amir finds some inswing but suffers for it as Woakes gets a thick inside edge that zips away for four. Wasim Akram, on commentary, feels it’s Amir’s own fault for not having his square leg closer to the umpire to allow for the inswing.Owen Dakin has spotted the possibility Tom Bowtell mentioned earlier, that England will beat their own record for the highest total with no inidual fifty – 315 at Port of Spain in 1986.87th over: England 279-6 (Buttler 31, Woakes 13) A maiden from Abbas to Woakes, culminating in an lbw appeal which is on the half-hearted side. The Mexican stag party are seen piling into a minibus. Watch out, Leeds city centre.86th over: England 279-6 (Buttler 31, Woakes 13) Here is Amir, varying his length. Woakes is suitably watchful. “Good evening Tim.” Good evening Simon McMahon. Have we all silently agreed not to bother with the comma after “evening”? It seems we have. Anyway. “The sound of the well oiled late evening Saturday crowd at Headingley brings back fond memories for me, as it was the first Test ground I ever visited. What was yours? Or our other esteemed OBOers?” Can’t speak for the rabble, but mine was Lord’s. England v New Zealand: a big hundred from Bev Congdon, not exciting in itself, but just being there was a thrill. This was 1973, so you probably weren’t even born.85th over: England 278-6 (Buttler 31, Woakes 12) A high-class maiden from Abbas, who beats both of Buttler’s edges with his ability to jag the ball both ways off the seam. The crowd are now singing something to the tune of Seven Nation Army, but it doesn’t seem to be Oh, Jeremy Corbyn. 84th over: England 278-6 (Buttler 31, Woakes 12) Amir has been loosening up, but Sarfraz would rather stick with Faheem. After being clipped for three by Buttler, he almost bowls Woakes with some extravagant inswing, then beats him, twice.83rd over: England 274-6 (Buttler 28, Woakes 11) Abbas returns, only to see his first ball clubbed through midwicket by Woakes, who is standing outside his crease like several of his team-mates today. He gets another one that keeps low, outside off this time, and pokes it to the vacant third-man boundary. Third slip goes out there, and Woakes edges short of second slip. The crowd don’t let any of this interfere with their noise levels – a contented rumble of chanting and chat.82nd over: England 265-6 (Buttler 28, Woakes 2) Faheem is bowling at the stumps, trying to exploit the untrue bounce. Woakes is equal to it, stabbing a low one to long leg, whereupon Sarfraz takes the new ball, with one delivery left in the over. The lead is 91.81st over: England 263-6 (Buttler 27, Woakes 1) Shadab continues, and here comes Chris Woakes, who always looks so comfortable at the crease, he could be Dom Bess.80th over: England 260-6 (Buttler 25) Bairstow cashes in on the old ball while he can, steering Faheem for four to third man, then thumping him through the covers for four more – only to perish next ball. Are all England’s batsmen now hell-bent on batting like Cook’s partners? And that’s drinks, as if an OBOer didn’t have enough to do. Pakistan have taken three wickets in the hour, but also leaked 60-odd runs.Just when he’s looking serene, Bairstow nicks the last delivery with the old ball. 79th over: England 251-5 (Bairstow 13, Buttler 24) Shadab, bowling his 13th over on the trot, dishes up a half-volley which Bairstow gratefully leathers to the boundary at wide long-off. And that’s probably that from Shadab, as the new ball is imminent.Finally, an answer to Mac Millings’ pain (71st over). “Pease advise Mac Millings,” says Geoff, “that soap and water are all that’s required. The bleach might have stung a bit but will have done no real harm - possibly analagous to Buttler getting skulled by Hasan. The stinging would have signified the oxidation of skin cells, which in turn will have turned the bleach into non-bleach. This is more reassuring than humorous.” Nothing wrong with a bit of reassurance.78th over: England 247-5 (Bairstow 9, Buttler 24) Before the review, the crowd were getting restless, doing the Mexican wave led by a band of cod-Mexicans in sombreros who are thought to be a stag party. If so, they’re a big one: there are about 25 of them.Charlie Jeffery is back for more too. This is like a class in which the bright kids keep on putting their hands up. “So Czech beer,” he says. “ I reckon Bess and Malan are both good beer sounding names. And a pint of Butlers \u0026amp Bairstow please. And a nice Woakes and Stokes pie.” Yes, going over leg stump. A good review by England.Bairstow given lbw playing no shot to Faheem. He reviews. It may be high.77th over: England 245-5 (Bairstow 8, Buttler 23) A couple more singles off Shadab.And Mac Millings is back for more. “Thanks to your readers for their lengthy consideration before replying to my 70th-over request for advice. Please let them know that I should still be able to read any helpful emails through my one remaining good eye for at least five or six more minutes.”76th over: England 242-5 (Bairstow 7, Buttler 21) It’s all happening. Buttler is hit on the helmet by Hasan, seems fine, gets a new helmet, hits a straight golf-swing of a drive for four, and then plays a controlled hook for three.An email from Adrian Armstrong. “Yup, England are reading the OBO (Tom Bowtell, tea interval). Wonder what side-effects that will have?” Ha. It means Rob Smyth should be the next national selector. 75th over: England 235-5 (Bairstow 7, Buttler 14) A couple of drives off Shadab, who now has the field set back.“Afternoon Tim.” Afternoon Phil Sawyer. “Keiron Shaw (62nd over) may wish to note that the Michael Vaughan situation only came about because, due to an administrative mix-up, the legend that is Glen Chapple was accidentally born in Yorkshire. We had to make a cold war style border exchange to get him back, and so us Lankies sent the Yorkists the most annoying person we could find.“He was, having said all that, a bloody good England captain, mind. Of course, Glen Chapple would have been even better.”74th over: England 233-5 (Bairstow 6, Buttler 13) Hasan follows his maiden to Bairstow with one to Buttler, which is an even greater feat. Anna Beer (66th over) responds to Rob Wilson (69th over). “Just to keep us totally off topic (cricket? yes? Is there some going on?),” she says, “my mum was not Gillian – but the wonderful Margaret, who introduced me to cricket. She loved Denis Compton, David Gower and Graham Thorpe. I had to rebel so I’m an Atherton woman myself. (And I’m also a Czech Beer....seriously).” This is becoming mildly surreal, which is just as it should be.73rd over: England 233-5 (Bairstow 6, Buttler 13) Shadab, uncharacteristically, bowls a full toss and Bairstow, more characteristically, straight-drives it for four.71st over: England 228-5 (Bairstow 2, Buttler 12) Back comes Hasan, to save Amir for the new ball. He restores order with a maiden and beats Bairstow outside off to boot. It would be good to know what the Pakistanis had for tea. “Excellent idea from the management,” says Chris Drew, “to get Dom Bess to play as a specialist batsman, thereby allowing Jos to revert to his luxury 7 role.”71st over: England 228-5 (Bairstow 2, Buttler 12) Buttler opens his account with a shot that is far too good for a banking metaphor – a dreamy cover drive off Shadab, threaded between three fielders. Then Buttler is dropped, a tough chance to Hasan Ali at midwicket off a full-blooded clip. He celebrates with a late cut for four more. He should be picked every time just because he’s so much fun to watch.“Quick question for you and your readership.” says Mac Millings. “I just got a fair bit of bleach on my face – is that bad?” Ouch. 69th over: England 216-5 (Bairstow 2, Buttler 0) Amir keeps Bairstow quiet, and the four runs are byes. This is what happens when two keepers come together.A question from Robert Wilson. “Is Anna Beer’s mum called Gillian? Relax, this is more an academic question than a pervy one.” Phew. “I had to avoid Gillian Beer for a year, having written an essay taking one of her books out the back with a baseball bat before realising that she was teaching the course I was about to take. I had, naturally, neglected to read the book (weren’t we all schmucks when we were 20?).” We certainly were.

Not long after she got the account she realised she didn’t have much use for it. When the younger one turned 13 she didn’t even lobby for a Facebook account. It was all about Instagram for her and still is,” he said.“It’s a big plus that Facebook owns Instagram, but this is a problem for their flagship brand and platform that they really need to sink their teeth into.”Teens are highly prized by social platforms for a number of reasons: people tend to take their habits with them as they age, they give platforms the “cool factor” and attract advertisers. In Verna’s view, this demographic shift is a “greater existential threat” to Facebook than the privacy concerns to have emerged following the Cambridge Analytics scandal. Despite the teen exodus, Facebook remains the world’s largest social platform with 2.2 billion monthly users.Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Like the TV show, it has been written jointly by Linehan and Arthur Mathews, with Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy responsible for the music.In response to questions from fans on Twitter, Linehan promised that the announcement was “true and not one of my stupid jokes”. He described the musical as the “real final episode”, adding: “Didn’t want to do something until the right idea came along. This was the right idea. Arthur and I have been laughing our arses off while writing it. Just like the old days.”In light of Donald Trump becoming US president and Jeremy Corbyn taking over as Labour leader, Linehan said he thought it “wouldn’t be too much of a stretch” for Father Ted to head up the Catholic church.“Obviously we’re pulling some shenanigans to get him into that position, but I think the shenanigans are entertaining enough that people won’t mind,” he told the BBC.The musical had not yet been cast and it was not clear when or where it would premiere. Surreal and slapstick, Father Ted featured Dermot Morgan and fellow Irish actors Ardal O’Hanlon, Frank Kelly and Pauline McLynn playing three priests and their housekeeper, living on the fictional Craggy Island off the west coast of Ireland.It was also the first time most British viewers saw Graham Norton, who went on to become a talk show host on Channel 4 and the BBC. Just three series of Father Ted were broadcast between 1995 and 1998 but the 25 episodes inspired a fanatical fan base in 10 countries and have been repeated regularly since.The sitcom won a Bafta, two British comedy awards and spawned an industry exemplified by the annual Tedfest event on the Aran islands.Morgan, who played Father Ted, died in February 1998, the day before his 46th birthday. He had considered becoming a priest before his religious beliefs lapsed and he became a standup comedian who often savaged the Catholic church. Kelly, who had a celebrated career on stage, film and television, died in 2016 at the age of 77."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e556ef1563b4b0fe0443040d19b4b84889fb006/0_55_3273_1963/master/3273.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a055b3fb9afff4f5ea860df80d1ab7d5","title":"las vegas workers strike automation casinos","story":"Increasing automation has become a sticking point alongside other issues that could see workers bring city to a standstillAt the Tipsy Robot in Las Vegas, a mechanical arm mixes cocktails that patrons order on tablet computers. “Galactic ambassadors” – human waitresses in shiny silver skirts – are sometimes available to deliver drinks. But the underlying message at the future-themed bar is that humans are irrelevant.It’s a novelty experience, but the future Tipsy Robot represents is one of several issues that may lead tens of thousands of Las Vegas hotel employees to strike in the coming days.The action could be a citywide resort strike, with dozens of casinos impacted.The contracts between Nevada’s largest hospitality companies – most notably MGM Resorts International – and an estimated 38,000 bartenders, cocktail servers, maids, cooks and others staff, expired 1 June. The Culinary and Bartenders Unions, which represent resort workers in the negotiations for a new five-year contract, say wage increases, workload quotas and job security threats posed by automation are the sticking points.Caesars Entertainment reached an agreement for its 12,000 union workers on Friday. But the months’ long labor talks are on pause with the other resort companies, which together account for 25 Las Vegas hotels.Strike dates have not been set, but staff at iconic properties like the Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, Circus Circus and The Mirage are ready to picket.This comes at one of the most lucrative moments in the strip’s recent history. The Vegas Golden Knights are skating in the Stanley Cup finals at the MGM Resorts-owned T-Mobile Arena in their inaugural season. Bars and sports books are packed with fans wearing hockey jerseys, leading some to wonder what would happen if the gambling palaces shut down. “We know that MGM for example is doing $3-4bn dollar buyback of stocks from their investors and we’re making the argument that workers are their best shareholders,” Bethany Khan, the Culinary Union spokeswoman, said. “We’ve been sacrificing for many years – especially during the great recession we decided to forgo wage increases so the companies could remain profitable. Now they are, so as their best investors we want a fair share of that.”If it were to last as long as the previous Las Vegas resort strike – 67 days in 1984 – Culinary estimates the work stoppage could cost MGM Resorts $200m, a heavy price to pay for a fleet of robots, which account for another hang-up in negotiations.Machines have already replaced the “change girls” who once roamed the casino floor. Since then prep cooks and bakers have seen positions dwindle due to mass food prep and commissary kitchen operations. Most recently, robot room service and digital check-in kiosks have threatened job security.“We know technology is coming, but we want to have a say in how it is implemented,” Khan said. “Be it monitoring the robot, stocking the robot, or whatever – as the jobs change inevitably workers should have opportunities to train for those new jobs. And if they can’t or won’t, they should receive generous severance packages.”Sexual harassment and safety is also a concern. The companies have tentatively agreed to provide alarm buttons to women who enter hotel rooms alone. Unions claim that management could do more to tackle aggressive sexual behavior by high rollers and other VIP clientele on the casino floor too, so the union is seeking new policies to handle those situations as well.Kayla Cinnamon, a bartender at the El Cortez, said that though she hadn’t experienced sexual harassment personally, she was willing to strike for those protections out of solidarity to other women. “It’s important we get our rights taken care of. That’s the point of having a union,” she added.Responding to the disputes, the casinos are keen to highlight the jobs they create.In an email statement, MGM Resorts said, “We remain dedicated to negotiating a contract that demonstrates our commitment to employees and their families while our company continues creating good jobs and future opportunities in Las Vegas.”The firm added: “We do not tolerate sexual harassment and have made a unequivocal commitment to our employees to take all necessary measures to protect them from any such behavior. MGM Resorts and the Culinary and Bartenders Unions are working on completing contract language that expresses our mutual commitment to protecting employees from workplace harassment.”Danielle Fetters, a cocktail waitress at the Mirage, said she’s anxious that the labor standoff will threaten gains already made and hopes the union settles for what’s on the table now.At the same time, Fetters and her colleagues on the casino floor are “legitimately worried” that touchscreen beverage ordering systems will soon diminish their roles serving slot machine players. That software is already being piloted in some casinos, where complimentary drinks are tied to the time and money a player spends gambling.“You used to get cigarettes and rooms and buffets and this really cool stuff,” she said.” “Now they’re so tight with everything, even though they’re making more money – and they want to get away from having cocktail waitresses? The art of customer service is completely gone. Don’t start with all this BS that you’re there for hospitality when you’re turning everything over to machines. It’s going to eliminate a lot of jobs for us, and then where do we go? This has been everything I know for my entire adult life.”At the Fremont casino in downtown Las Vegas, Ivan, a bartender with a Russian accent, said the strike was a good, principled stand to allow workers to share in the resorts’ profits, but he’s not yet worried about automation.“Sooner or later it’s going to happen, but robots can’t beat us yet. At high volume places I don’t see it, and high-end places no way. It’s a social environment too. It’s not just about getting a drink.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c58b87f170970526fb6c238f1efe7ee971246c95/143_0_3020_1812/master/3020.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63fb604512f473664eac481226fc3da7","title":"egypt abdel fatah al sisi sworn in second term amid crackdown on dissent","story":"MPs gather for pompous ceremony that follows arrests targeting opponents and criticsThe Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, has been sworn in for a second term, following a fresh round of arrests targeting opponents and critics.“Egypt can fit us all with all our differences. Accepting others and creating common ground will be important for us in order to create political development,” he told MPs who had gathered to witness his oath of office, following a ceremony heavy on military pomp. Some interrupted his speech to shout their admiration of the president, including one MP who recited a poem of praise.Sisi’s inauguration follows a renewed crackdown on even the most benign opposition to his rule. In recent weeks, at least six prominent dissidents have been arrested and detained in pre-dawn raids. Twenty-two people protesting against a fare hike on the Cairo metro were arrested and investigated on terrorism charges, including joining a banned group. As Sisi took the oath of office, the arrests of recent weeks indicated that his second term may allow even less space for dissent than his first. Since coming to power in 2013, Sisi’s rule has been marked by efforts to crush all forms of dissent, with his government targeting Islamists, critics, activists, human rights organisations and journalists. But with almost no public opposition remaining, he is working to shore up support within an already compliant system. More than 200 MPs in Egypt’s rubber-stamp parliament have switched allegiances to a new political party, Future of the Homeland, founded to support Sisi and drawing comparisons with the corrupt National Democratic Party of deposed autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Its creation is a possible precursor to an anticipated referendum that would alter the constitution to extend presidential terms, removing limits and allowing Sisi to become “president for life”.The opulent inauguration followed a wave of arrests of dissidents including the blogger Wael Abbas, labour lawyer and socialist activist Haytham Mohamadeen, satirist Shady Abu Zeid, activist Shady al-Ghazaly Harb and outspoken former Sisi supporter Hazem Abd al-Azim. It also includes activist Amal Fathy, who made a video discussing sexual harassment in Egypt. “Sisi is expecting a turbulent second mandate so he needs the opposition forces to be under control while unchecked voices are silenced,” said Fathy’s husband, Mohamed Lotfy, the head of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms. The French journalist Nina Hubinet earlier this week said she had been barred from entering Egypt after arriving in Cairo for a holiday five years after she last reported from there. In February, Egypt arrested and deported British journalist Bel Trew, a correspondent for the Times. “The inequality of growth is stark and the situation of most Egyptians is still quite dire,” said Michael Hanna, an analyst with the New York thinktank The Century Foundation.Adham Youssef contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6932b84affd0892ebe20ee76ecf912a87d139de2/0_28_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=686dec9970638034d0f666249773c983","title":"guatemala texas rio bravo border claudia gomez","story":"A week ago, 20-year-old Claudia Gómez was shot dead by border patrol agents in Texas – and no one has provided answers for her grieving familyby  Nina Lakhani in San Juan Ostuncalco and  Tom Dart in Rio BravoWhen Claudia Gómez was a little girl she would climb fruit trees for cherries and apricots, and chase her friends through the lush corn fields scattered across the hills of their village in western Guatemala.Her family remember her as a warm-hearted and mischievous girl who was riveted by mathematics from an early age, and who would sing to her two younger sisters as she braided their long black hair.“My daughter was naughty and cuddly and playful. She loved to draw and sing,” said Lidia González, 39, who was wrapped in a traditional woven shawl and headscarf against the chilly night at the family home.As she spoke, González gazed sadly at a makeshift shrine: a wide open basket containing a photograph of Claudia, surrounded by candles and bunches of long-stemmed white chrysanthemums.“Claudia was a good girl and a good student. My daughter didn’t do anything wrong, it’s not fair that immigration killed her – why did they do that?” she said.It is over a week since 20-year-old Claudia Patricia Gómez González was shot in the head by a US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agent in Rio Bravo, Texas, and no one has provided answers for her grief-stricken mother. “It doesn’t make sense,” Gonzalez said, speaking in the indigenous Mayan Mam language through an interpreter. “We spoke the day before she died – and she was excited and happy.” San Juan Ostuncalco is sprawling collection of mostly Mam communities scattered amid the forest-clad mountains outside Guatemala’s second largest city Quetzaltenango.This region was the setting for repeated atrocities by government forces during the country’s 36-year civil war that left 200,000 civilians dead – most of them indigenous – and triggered a wave of forced migration to the US in the 1980s. The tell-tale signs of migration are everywhere. Rural town centres are packed with fast food joints and malls, and the winding potholed roads are peppered with American-style concrete houses – including the Gómez family home. Like many children in this region, Gómez saw little of her father growing up because he spent years in the US as an undocumented migrant until he was deported last year.She was raised by a tight network of female relatives by 12, she had mastered the skill of making tortillas by hand after copying her mother, aunts and grandmothers who all live close by.In high school, Gómez played midfield in football and gave reggaeton dance lessons in between classes, homework, dating and heart-to-hearts with her friends. She was a devout Christian who recently swapped the family’s Catholic tradition for an evangelical church.Life was hectic and full of possibilities. She graduated in 2016 with an accounting certificate, but the ambitious youngster was rejected by a string of banks and local businesses.She applied to San Carlos University to study for an accounting degree but didn’t pass the tough entrance exam for a place at the country’s only public university her family could not afford to send her to one of Guatemala’s many private universities. After more than a year stuck at home with no job and no money, the future looked bleak. One by one, her school friends were giving up on work, to get married and have babies, but Gómez wanted more. “I’m going to America,” she told her parents firmly. “Don’t worry, I’ll be back in a few years.”She left home in early May, excited about the impending adventure in the US, where she hoped to find work to pay for university – and be reunited with her boyfriend, who had made it to Virginia about a year earlier. It was 3am when she hugged her grandmother Tomasa Vicente, 70, and told her: “Don’t worry abuela, I’ll be back soon – I promise.”It is unclear what she knew about the increasing hostility towards migrants under Trump when she convinced an aunt in Atlanta to loan her money to pay the coyote, or guide, about $10,000.“My niece left home like I did 18 years ago, because it’s the only way to escape poverty and move forward,” said the aunt, who asked for her name to be withheld for fear of deportation and separation from her US-born children.“She wanted to live her dreams, make something of her life. I was waiting for her to call, but the call I got was to tell me she was dead. This is a nightmare. I am so sad.”Gómez made the perilous journey through Mexico with five other youngsters from neighbouring rural communities. It was her first journey out of Quetzaltenango.She was killed in Texas less than three weeks after leaving home.Rio Bravo is a tiny, sparsely populated settlement well away from the legal ports of entry and border fences in Laredo. It is a popular crossing point for undocumented migrants who make their way by raft or boat across the river that represents the iding line between the US and Mexico.The southern US border – with its inhospitable terrain and guards – is a treacherous place for migrants. A  investigation published three weeks before Gómez was killed found that CPB agents used deadly force on at least 97 people in the past 15 years. Almost 73,000 Guatemalan families have been detained at that border in the past three years.Gómez died in circumstances that remain unclear, in an overgrown lot framed by ramshackle homes. She was about a third of a mile from the border.Border patrol initially said that an agent fired the fatal shot after a group of people he suspected of being undocumented resisted arrest and attacked him “using blunt objects”.The shooting was witnessed and filmed by a neighbour who posted a video online.Two days later, the CPB cancelled a press conference, and released a new statement in which some details were changed and there was no reference to “blunt objects”. It read: “According to the agent, the group ignored his verbal commands and instead rushed him.”González was no longer described as an “assailant”, but a “member of the group,” it said.Shortly after Gómez died, three of her travel companions were detained. They await deportation. The whereabouts of the other two is unknown.The unnamed agent is on administrative leave while the FBI investigates.When the  visited Rio Bravo a week after Gómez’s death, four border patrol SUVs were stationed at the river’s edge while a police patrol car drove through the town.It remains unclear why the CPB changed its story, but the agency did not respond to the ’s questions.Activists in the US have called for transparency in the case.“I think people are sceptical that justice will happen,” said Sister Rosemary Welsh, who runs a migrant shelter in Laredo and a mobile health clinic that visits Rio Bravo. “My concern is that if there isn’t a really good investigation – and I have to believe that there will be – then it’ll cause more unrest.”“Why was lethal force needed?” she asked.José Saldana, 22, of the Laredo Immigrant Alliance, a recently-formed advocacy group, said: “They want to militarise the border but they don’t have the proper training.”The unanswered questions have only added to the family’s grief back in Guatemala.“What’s the agent’s name? Has he killed before?” said paternal aunt Dominga Vicente, 42, speaking at the family home as her youngest child slept wrapped in a sling on her back. “We ask God to bless the kind woman who filmed the scene, otherwise my niece would be just another disappeared migrant. Tell the Americans we want justice.”At the family home, a towering cloud of smoke emanated from the open cooking fire as dozens of women prepared corn tamales, black beans and huge pots of chicken stew.Thanks to donations from friends, neighbours and relatives – the simple feast will feed hundreds of mourners accompanying the parents as they bring home Gomez’s body to its final resting place.Claudia Gómez will be buried on Saturday returned to mother earth where Mayans believe life begins. Vigils have also been held in Rio Bravo and in Alexandria, Virginia, where Gómez hoped to be reunited with her boyfriend.Her grandmother Tomasa Vicente recalls her last goodbye, grasping on to her listener’s arm with a wrinkled hand.“She was so happy and excited to go, but my heart was heavy. ‘Please be careful, I told her, stay in touch, and pray to God to keep you safe,’” she said. “She promised to come home but now she’s gone forever.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/614ef8bb0e0e09c10e48fa6ae4558fa50c0546c5/137_0_2727_1637/master/2727.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c91c89118e444f80074bca3e7dfd470f","title":"juncker eu italy olive branch","story":"Jean-Claude Juncker has thrown the new government in Rome an olive branch, warning that Brussels and “German-speaking countries” must not repeat the error made during the Greek crisis by reading stern lectures to the Italian people.The president of the European commission said that, while he had been tempted to intervene during the recent political impasse in Italy, he was determined not to feed the populist narrative: that the EU is meddling in domestic affairs.Juncker noted that the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the rightwing League party had both recently dropped their policy of exit from the European Union, and he would judge them on their deeds and not their rhetoric.Giuseppe Conte was sworn in as Italian prime minister on Friday after a last-ditch coalition deal between the two parties ended months of political deadlock and narrowly averted the need for a snap election in the eurozone’s third-largest economy.Conte attended a military parade on his first full day in office, while his deputy Matteo Salvini, head of the League and an ally of French rightwing leader Marine Le Pen, was heading to Sicily as part of his campaign against illegal immigration.In an interview with German news service RedaktionsNetzwerk, Juncker admitted to “concern” about the recent developments in Italy, but insisted that the recent turmoil in the financial markets in response to the new government had been “irrational” and should not be seen as a guide to how the political story will unfold in Rome.“I think very highly of President Mattarella, but I have not spoken to him during this crisis. I have not interfered, although I have been tempted to,” Juncker said. “I do not want to feed the accusations spread by the populists that we are sitting in Brussels meddling in Italy’s affairs. I am certain the Italians have a keen sense of what is good for their country. They will sort it out.”But he went on: “By keeping out of it, I’m not helping. By getting involved, I’m not helping. I am caught between a rock and a hard place.”The commission president had flirted with danger on Thursday by suggesting that the EU should not be blamed for the state of Italy’s poorer regions, where there needed to be “more work” and “less corruption”. Rather than blaming the EU, there needed to be more “seriousness” within the country about tackling its economic and social problems, he said.In this latest interview, Juncker claimed that he had personally fought against those who wanted to launch an excessive debt procedure against Italy over the state of its finances, a process that would be designed to give the EU more power to enforce austerity on Rome.Italy, the third-largest economy in the eurozone, has a public debt second only to Greece’s and there was a negative reaction from the financial markets to the League-M5S coalition, which plans to significantly raise public spending.Juncker offered a more placatory tone, suggesting that Brussels and Berlin had learned the lessons of the Greek crisis. He also denied that the eurozone was set on a course for another economic downturn: “The Italians cannot really complain about austerity measures from Brussels. However, I do not now want to lecture Rome. We must treat Italy with respect. Too many lectures were given to Greece in the past, in particular from German-speaking countries. This dealt a blow to the dignity of the Greek people. The same thing must not be allowed to happen to Italy.” Juncker said that the financial markets’ reaction was “irrational”: “People should not draw political conclusions from every fluctuation in the stock market. Investors have been wrong on so many occasions.”Neither of the coalition parties in the new Italian government campaigned on leaving the euro or the EU, but both have backed such calls in the past and are scathing about the rules that underpin the eurozone.Mujtaba Rahman, a former European commission and UK Treasury official who now works for consultancy the Eurasia Group, warned that as the cornerstone of the coalition government’s platform was fiscal expansion, it was liable to clash with the commission this autumn.“A significant deviation from EU-mandated fiscal targets may prompt the commission to open a new Excessive Deficit Procedure, a process designed to give the EU more power to enforce austerity on Rome. Yet the symbolism of this move would only strengthen the Italian government’s domestic standing.”The size of the Italian economy means that a bailout in line with that given to Greece – should the financial markets turn on the Italian government – would be a huge and crippling endeavour for the EU. Rumours have emerged in Brussels that Berlin is looking at a plan B which would instead involve seeking to contain the spill over of future economic turmoil in Italy.Daniel Gros, a German economist, and director of the Centre for European Policy Studies think-tank, said: “The view is that it would be impossible to do a standard European Stability Mechanism programme for Italy because you would exhaust the entire capacity of the ESM. And Italy is not like Greece: it has a strong economy, it has a current account surplus and critically it has very little net foreign debt as a country. It would make no sense. Yet an ESM might be needed, if things get rough, to help Spain and Portugal.He added: “This is not an economic problem where economic measures are needed but just some crazy politics for which one does not understand the rationale... There is very little Brussels can do. I think they are still hoping that somehow they can bring Italy to reason, but I think that is a forlorn hope”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b3990c73370614aa406088b853adc8ae7512a56/0_31_3712_2227/master/3712.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b558fa7e6776aefaaef5f636bd7a6e46","title":"lysette anthony welcomes start of harvey weinstein trial","story":"‘It’s all we ever wanted,’ says Hollyoaks star, before calling for women to stand togetherLysette Anthony welcomed the beginning of legal proceedings against Harvey Weinstein as she sported a #MeToo slogan on her wrist at the British Soap Awards.The Hollyoaks star is one of dozens of women who have made allegations against the movie mogul and said he needed be tried. She has said that she told the politan police she was attacked by him in her London home in the late 1980s. Speaking before the awards, Anthony welcomed the start of court proceedings against the producer in the US as she called for women to stand together. She told the Press Association: “Time is up – what I’m happy about is that it stops being trial by Twitter and justice gets due course. It’s what it’s all about, it’s all any of us, we’ve ever wanted. I’m telling the truth, but he needs the chance to be tried.” Anthony said dozens of other accusers had stories similar to hers. She compared the Time’s Up and Me Too movements to the Arab spring, adding: “I don’t mean to be disrespectful, because people died with the Arab spring, but that’s the purpose of Twitter – it is lone voices in the wilderness being heard, and that’s the most important thing.”Coronation Street star Nicola Thorp and Doctors actor Elisabeth Dermot Walsh supported Time’s Up on the awards red carpet, with the latter wearing a pin on her dress. Thorp said: “I’m so proud that actresses, not just in the UK but over the pond, have really been highlighting the issue with sexual harassment, not just in entertainment but in all lines of work. Weinstein has been indicted on rape and criminal sex act charges in New York. The film producer was charged in May on two counts of rape and one of a criminal sexual act for alleged incidents involving two women.

China claims the self-governing island as its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary.But in a quick pivot, he said the US welcomed cooperation with China “wherever possible” and announced that he had accepted Beijing’s invitation to visit there soon. It remains to be seen if that invitation will stand after this conference.The Pentagon leader’s comments at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue came in the wake of a tumultuous few weeks between the US and China.Last week the US withdrew an invitation for Beijing to participate in an exercise known as Rim of the Pacific. China had participated in the exercise in 2014 and 2016.The Pentagon said the decision to disinvite the Chinese navy was triggered by what it called strong evidence that China has deployed weapons systems on the islands, and called on China to remove them. China says it is within its rights to build up defences on islands in the South China Sea that it believes are its sovereign territory.China’s activities, Mattis said in his speech Saturday, stand “in stark contrast to the openness of what our strategy promotes. It calls into question China’s broader goals.”In recent years the US had sought to stabilise military relations with China, but the militarisation of the islands has been a persistent point of conflict. Many nations fear that Beijing will use the construction on the islands to extend its military reach and potentially try to restrict navigation in the South China Sea.China has not sent high-level officials to the three-day meeting, in an apparent attempt to deflect attention from its campaign to expand its sovereignty across virtually the entire South China Sea.Mattis made clear that the US does not expect nations to choose between the US and China, adding that Beijing should have a voice in shaping the region, while allies have a voice in shaping China’s role.The US, he said, “will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperation when possible, and competing vigorously where we must”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3505689.1527087516!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"in praise of aphid eating pollinators","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA hoverfly at tomato flowers: drawing by Michael  VineyFor me, summer will be confirmed when I am stopped in my tracks by a glint in the air a step or two ahead of me: a spark of pure sunlight with just a hint of colour, a tiny whirr of wings that makes a space shift sideways, or up or down in a sudden, quantum bilocation.The insect is showing off, staking out a territory and hoping for a mate, and if I can track it to a flower, the hint of colour will no doubt resolve into the imitative, wasp-bright, yellow and black markings of so many of Ireland’s hoverflies.Stingless, most no bigger than a thumbnail, hoverflies are a largely unsung legion among our insect pollinators. Evolution has woven them into the ersity of wildflowers, and the past 5,000 years have recruited their Irish range of species, some 180 strong.While the pollinating services of bumblebees and honeybees deserve their headlines, gardeners value hoverflies for another great benefit. Their larvae, hatched on plants, eat sap-sucking aphid pests rapaciously: they are “aphidophagous”.Outstanding in this respect is the common and much-studied Episyrphus balteatus, whose glowing orange body bands make it “the marmalade fly”. Laying perhaps 4,500 eggs in its lifetime in the heart of aphid colonies, it is the aphids’ most effective natural enemy, to be welcomed into cereal crops and tomato and strawberry tunnels. Welcomed, that is, by growers who prefer aphid control by hoverflies than the toxic protection of pesticides.Last year, as the termination of neonicotinoids was finally played out in Europe, shocking news of major insect decline was reported in Germany. A 27-year record of insect biomass in 63 nature protection areas showed a midsummer decline in flying insects of 82 per cent – a drop inexplicable in terms of habitat or weather.This is part of the wider decline in flying insects that leaves our car windscreens and headlights unnaturally clean at journey’s end. It threatens to worsen as climate change disrupts the insects’ habitats and range. But more immediate threats are posed by the intensive farmland they fly across on long-distance migration.The marmalade fly, for example, while native to Ireland for thousands of years, is also a determined migrant. Like some of our butterflies, it travels in huge numbers from the Mediterranean, arriving in July and August and spreading across the island.The first scientific record of this came in 1995, when two biologists in a boat off Courtmacsherry Bay in Co Cork saw skeins of hoverflies heading for the coast in company with clouds of red admirals. The flies were so numerous that dead ones were forming drift lines on the sea. Such mass arrivals have sometimes caused public panic, as on coasts of southeast England during a heatwave in 2004. Mistaking the hoverflies for wasps as the insects settled on them for a rest, children ran screaming, prams were covered up, and so on.As for their return to the south, a memorable observation came from a British ornithologist, David Lack. Climbing to a high, narrow pass in the Pyrenees to check the passage of migrating birds, he found a torrent of hoverflies, chiefly Episyrphus balteatus, pressing on at ankle height into the wind. What caught his eye was “a shimmer of iridescent light, due to the reflection of the autumn sun on myriad tiny wings”. Given the dire decline reported from Germany, I have to wonder how far hoverfly migrations through Europe to Britain and Ireland have already been hit by neonicotinoids. The marmalade is among the hoverflies attracted especially to the nectar of yellow flowers, like the sulphurous shades of fields of oilseed rape, prime candidate for systemic pesticides. Such threats crop up in the scientific bible of Europe’s hoverflies, Syrph-the-net, the remarkable database compiled and maintained by Dr Martin Speight, long the leading entomologist of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and now with Trinity College Dublin’s zoology department.For example, accompanying the marmalade fly among the “anthropophilic” (human-friendly) species is another migrant, Eristalis arbustorum (no English name), common in urban parks and gardens. But its appetite for the nectar of hedgerow plants takes it on to farmland, where its larvae mature in cow dung.Like other insects involved in recycling manure, its progressive decline has been blamed on dosing cattle with systemic chemicals, such as ivermectin, to kill parasitic worms.There are few common names among hoverflies and a great variety in size, shape and colouring: several dark ones look more like bees. There is much more about them at the Irish Pollinator Initiative hosted on the website of the National Bioersity Data Centre (bioersityireland.ie).This also offers species photographs, gives access to their accounts in Syrph-the-Net and welcomes new records of local hoverfly species. These may begin with that memorable pause, a few mesmerising moments, watching a hovering hoverfly doing its quantum thing."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Labour leader says British parliament does not support government\u0026rsquos stance on the issueMan in his 30s is arrested following discovery of cannabis herb, cannabis resin and cocaineGarda\u0026iacute detain two men and recover a revolver during operation in Dublin 3Republic\u0026rsquos activists will back LGBTI rights and abortion reform in the North, event toldFirm\u0026rsquos payment system is back at \u0026lsquofull capacity\u0026rsquo after IT failure led to chaos across EuropeGarda\u0026iacute appeal for witnesses after man\u0026rsquos death following row at pub on Friday nightOregon Maple tree was planted in the 1840s, a sister tree in the square is being examinedDr Diarmuid Martin criticises the Church\u0026rsquos role in institutional care in IrelandCrowd gathers outside Nike\u0026rsquos flagship store in London to get hands on bright green kitThe 90s dance hit is an effective aid while carrying out CPR, researchers claimMajority of 5,000 customers that lost power overnight had their service restored by 2pmPensioner convicted of putting bomb on bus during Queen\u0026rsquos visit wants his appeal in IrishGarda\u0026iacute and HSE investigate how adult material featured on DVD for childrenGarda\u0026iacute recover MDMA and cannabis after searching man in Leixlip on Friday night\u0026lsquoInspiring and funny\u0026rsquo: Tributes paid to 15-year-olds Jack Kenneally, Shay MoloneyPew study shows 95 per cent of teens \u0026lsquonow say they have access to a smartphone\u0026rsquoThree fire brigade units dispatched to scene of blaze at home in SouthillYour questions answered about the debit and credit card problem that affected millionsBank Holiday weather: Met \u0026Eacuteireann predicts scattered thunderstorms and spot flooding\u0026lsquoI screamed and roared at his disappearance, and a nun slapped me right across the face\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3516825.1527891655!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government gives theresa may two weeks to solve border issue","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney: ‘If there is no progress on the backstop, we are in for an uncertain summer.’ Photograph: Cyril Byrne British prime minister Theresa May has two weeks to table written proposals on how to solve the Irish Border issue in order to avoid a Brexit crisis at a crucial EU summit later this month, the Government has said.Tánaiste Simon Coveney says the European Union taskforce, led by Michel Barnier, must receive detailed proposals in writing from the British government within a fortnight.This would allow time to debate and discuss the proposals ahead of the European Council meeting on June 28th and 29th. The Government has said substantial progress on the Border, including the so-called “backstop”, must be made by this summit.“In the next two weeks, we need to see written proposals,” Mr Coveney told The . “It needs to happen two weeks from the summit.”Mr Coveney’s warning reflects increasing exasperation in Dublin and Brussels that no firm proposals have emerged from London, with just weeks until the summit.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Mr Coveney and other senior Ministers such as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe have repeatedly told their UK counterparts that such proposals are needed soon.“There’s a new idea or solution being mooted every week,” said a senior Government source, adding that Dublin was only “interested in proposals that are written down”.“On paper like. Or on a screen. We are at legal text stage. We need legal texts to draft and debate.”A leaked proposal on Friday from UK Brexit secretary David Davis – that would give Northern Ireland joint UK and EU status so it could trade freely with both, as well as a “buffer zone” to eliminate the need for border checkpoints with Ireland – was dismissed by Government figures.The latest proposals were also dismissed by the Democratic Unionist Party which urged its Conservative partners in the UK government to stop coming up with “half-cooked ideas” on how to deal with the Border question.The party’s East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said on Friday that none of the mooted proposals had been discussed with his party. He described them as “at best contradictory”.On the buffer zone, one Government source in Dublin said it only moved a potential physical border, rather than ensuring that no physical border would be in place after Brexit.The UK and EU are due to agree a withdrawal agreement, including the Irish backstop, by October, but the Government has warned this will be thrown into doubt unless substantial progress is made this month.The backstop – which would ensure no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland without agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border – was agreed in principle in December, although the UK has rejected the EU’s legal interpretation of it.“If there is no progress on the backstop, we are in for an uncertain summer,” Mr Coveney said. “At this point we need written proposals on the Irish backstop consistent with what was agreed.

File photograph: Stephen CollinsCollins PhotosLabour Party leader Brendan Howlin has said the Brexit position of Britain’s government amounted to “a very British coup”.Mr Howlin said he believed the British government does not have the support of its parliament for its Brexit strategy.He also called for prime minister Theresa May to demonstrate her mandate for her position on the issue.“It is entirely unclear that the positions being pursued by the British government have the support from the British parliament. What evidence we have suggests not. It appears too that the British government thinks so too. Having been defeated 15 times in the House of Lords the British government is yet to bring the EU Withdrawal Bill to the House of Commons ,” Mr Howlin said.Mr Howlin, who is also Labour spokesman on foreign affairs and Northern Ireland, made the remarks in a statement issued on Saturday.His comments come amid ongoing ridicule of a proposal from Britain’s Brexit secretary David Davis to create a 16km buffer zone around the Border following Brexit. Mr Davis’s latest plan would give Northern Ireland joint UK and EU status so it could trade freely with both, as well as a buffer zone to eliminate the need for Border checkpoints with the Republic. The proposals were roundly dismissed by Irish Government figures, members of the British parliament and the DUP, which urged the Tories to stop coming up with “half-cooked ideas” on how to deal with the Border question. Pro-EU MPs have accused the British government of “making it up as they go along” when it comes to the issue.“The May government is refusing to advance its own Trade and Customs Bill in the House of Commons . . . because it fears defeat at the hands of Conservative rebels and Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats,” Mr Howlin said.“Meanwhile, the EU is obliged to engage with a British government whose extreme Brexit position draws no mandate either from the people in the referendum or Westminster.“If Ms May has a mandate for her position, let her prove it.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

File image: Leon NealAFPGetty ImagesThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has urged the British Conservative Party to stop coming up with “half-cooked ideas” on dealing with the Border and to provide clarity on its Brexit plan.Britain’s Brexit secretary David Davis was reported on Thursday to be creating a plan that would give Northern Ireland joint UK and European Union status so it could trade freely with both, as well as a buffer zone to eliminate the need for border checkpoints with Ireland.Mr Davis is drawing a proposed 16km-wide trade buffer zone along the Border that would be in effect for local traders, such as dairy farmers, after Britain leaves the bloc, The Sun newspaper reported.A 10-mile wide “special economic zone” would be created along the 310-mile border, within which local traders could operate under the Republic’s trade rules.The DUP, which props up British Prime Minister Theresa May’s government at Westminster, has made clear that it does not want Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the UK.The party’s East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said on Friday that none of the mooted proposals had been discussed with his party. He described them as “at best contradictory”.He said: “First of all, to suggest that Northern Ireland be tied to both EU and UK regulations, when one of the objectives of leaving the single market is to allow the UK to set its own regulations, raises the question which regulations apply to Northern Ireland if and when the UK and the EU regulations erge?“Secondly, who will make the judgement as to which regulations should apply? Will it be the EU or the UK Government? Will it be the UK courts or the European Court of Justice?”Mr Wilson said the purpose of the border buffer zone “appears to be even less clear”. He asked what would happen to trade from outside the buffer zone when it crossed into the zone and if checks would have to be carried out there.Mr Wilson said the British Government must make it clear that all of the borders that would exist as a consequence of Britain leaving the EU “whether that is between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, the Irish Republic and Great Britain, or Great Britain and Europe all present the same problems”.He concluded: “Instead of moving from one set of half-cooked ideas to the other it is now time for the Government to put down its foot and make it clear to EU negotiators that the Prime Minister stands by her commitment that no deal is better than a bad deal and if they want to avoid the consequences then they need to stop dismissing the perfectly feasible ideas that were put forward in August of last year.”Sinn Féin accused Mr Davis of trying to “hide a hard border in a buffer zone”.MEP Martina Anderson said: “Once again this shows the lack of knowledge of border areas and the concerns they face - David Davis obviously didn’t learn much on his flying visits.”Mr Davis’s Department for Exiting the EU did not deny that the proposal was under consideration.A Downing Street spokesman said: “The Prime Minister has been absolutely clear that we cannot and will not accept a customs border down the Irish Sea, and that we will preserve the integrity of the UK’s common market.” - Additional reporting PANegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland

He wasn’t injured. Then I think they also re­cognised it was Be­ne­dict and ran away.\u0026nbsp“He asked the rider how he was and when he said, ‘I’m OK’ Benedict just hugged him.”The police have since confirmed they were called to the scene at Marylebone High Street, just half a mile from Baker Street, in November.

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One was so long ago that engraving had to do the job of photography the other was recent enough that some people alive today will have heard about it from their parents. In one, a foreign ship came to grief in British waters in the other, a British vessel went down in foreign waters, and down she stayed.First to Texel, safe haven, population 13,500: the largest of the West Frisian Islands off the coast of the Netherlands in the Wadden Sea. Today it is a magnet for Dutch cyclists, walkers, swimmers and riders (the latter an important reminder that Texel is the only known place where an entire navy was defeated by men on horseback, which is another tale altogether).In June 1743, a 700 ton vessel, VOC Hollandia, set sail on her maiden voyage bound for Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, now known as Jakarta. In any study of trade between Europe and Asia throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company is pivotal, shipping everything from nutmegs and cinnamon to coffee and tobacco, porcelain to rubber. And that is what VOC stands for: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie.A brief history of democracy: Is it the \u0027will of the people\u0027?Yet on this prestigious occasion, Hollandia, being of brand new and bold design, an impressive 42 metres in length, was carrying a particularly special cargo: not only many VIP passengers but also 130,000 coins. Most were “pillar-dollars”, cut to represent smaller denominations, but among the haul were also highly valuable Mexican and Guatemalan silver coins.Hollandia’s captain must have been nervous therefore, as he headed for Brittany through rough seas. Perhaps he was aware too that just 36 years before, in 1707, at least 1,550 men had perished in the same waters, haplessly drifting towards the Scillies aboard four Royal Navy warships: the Firebrand, the Romney, the Association and the Eagle. (Indeed, square mile for square mile, the treacherous Scillies are probably responsible for more of the world’s estimated 159,000 shipwrecks than anywhere else.)Remember, these were the days before the invention of reliable navigation instruments still before the erection of most lighthouses.Texel is now a popular tourist venueSure enough, like those earlier ships, the Hollandia was blown off course, scarcely six weeks after setting sail, on a blustery 13 July. And it too came to grief off the Isles of Scilly, striking the notorious Gunner Rock, going down just off Annet, an uninhabited nature reserve just 54 acres in size, 20 miles from the Cornish coast.Nobody lived to tell the tale.Miraculously, in 1971 a London attorney called Rex Cowan discovered the Hollandia’s wreck, along with its bronze cannons and some of its treasure. Unusually, he was using a proton magnetometer, allowing him to test the Earth’s field of magnetic resonance, which in the process reveals every slight variation across that field – including ferrous objects embedded in land or sea.However, it is now time to turn to the anniversary of a sinking far further away and to consider the watery grave awaiting an equally emblematic vessel. This was a calamity that was far more preventable.Many boats have come a cropper in the waters around the Scilly Isles (iStock)State of the art flagship and battleship, the HMS Victoria – named in named in honour of the Queen’s impending Golden Jubilee in 1886 – was launched at a cost of £845 from Elswick on the Tyne. When she headed for the Mediterranean in June 1893 for training exercises, she had already endured one major mishap – a grounding at Platea, off the Greek coast, with Captain Maurice Archibald Bourke having permitted members of his crew to misplace the buoys that might have saved him from some very shallow waters.On that first cataclysmic day, 29 January 1892, no full tide – indeed nothing at all – would get the extraordinarily long (100 metres), extraordinarily heavy (11,200 tons) Victoria afloat again. Jettisoning 483 tons of coal, and calling for a tow from three other Royal Navy frigates, somehow the Victoria – its bottom damaged, three of its compartments seriously damaged – resumed its voyage on 4 February, limping into the new Hamilton Dock, Malta, for repairs. Bourke, despite being severely censured, retained his command.  HMS Victoria in dock, prior to completionAt the dawn of a second catastrophic day, 22 June 1893, Bourke and his contemporaries, among them Captain Jenkins on the Collingwood and Captain Markham on the Camperdown, were lined up like tin soldiers ready for an experimental manoeuvre – a very tight one at that. It was their misfortune to be in the hands of Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon, Commander of the British Mediterranean fleet: an obstinate, overbearing man with some very peculiar traits and strategies.Tryon was deliberately taciturn and unapproachable – the better, he thought, to assert the superiority of his rank. The better too to outdo “inferior” French and Italian navies also cruising the vital Mediterranean and the better to force his officers to think on their feet.Inexplicably – and at a time when signalling remained primitive, based as it was on a mixture of flags, semaphores and lamps – Tryon wanted the two columns of his fleet to turn, uniformly, a full 180 degrees, first towards each other then (so the theory went) retracing their prior course. His 11 Captains – with Tryon himself menacingly aboard the Victoria – were to do this whilst positioned a mere 1,100 or 1,200 metres from each other, even though a gap of 1,800-2,200 metres might have been considered a safe bare minimum.Markham hesitated. Surely Tryon had confused radii for diameters? Surely he had issued the sort of order likely to be revoked any minute? Perhaps Tryon really intended the convoy to turn 60 degrees to port, then 60 degrees to starboard, before resuming its original course?Tryon however, was getting impatient. Fearing humiliation – his colleagues also hesitant to defy their esteemed commander – Markham aboard the Camperdown conceded, swinging towards the fated Victoria, despite believing he cannot avoid hitting her.  Even so, the Victoria – built before the installation of automatic bulkhead doors – has many proven stabilisers. Perhaps Bourke is a more gifted captain than he has previously demonstrated?At the last, both lead vessels went straight into reverse thrust. But it was all too late.Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon was a difficult man insofar as his junior colleagues were concernedThe toughened steel ram of the Camperdown tore 9 feet into the side of the Victoria, a full 12 feet below its waterline. After two minutes the two vessels disengage but the Victoria lists, her many gun hatches and portholes taking in floods of swirling water.Three minutes later, her bow dips – but an unrelenting Tryon demands any rescue boats return to their respective ships. Now he commands the leaking Victoria to head straight for the shores of Tripoli, five miles distant. After all, the Victoria’s engines are still running, many men below deck unharmed.Maybe Tryon trusts that the “watertight” doors are still closed, so trapping many hands not already flushed into the ocean. Rapidly though, certainly by collision plus eight minutes, the whole of the Victoria’s bow is submerged, its stern far out of true, propellers turning in open air.At last, but way too late, Tryon yells: “Abandon ship! Everyone for himself!”  Five minutes on, the top deck goes under. Loosened boilers explode. Everything remotely portable bounces into the already hazardous surrounding ocean.Two men on board refuse to jump ship: Reverend SD Morris, the chaplain on duty in the sick bay, who folds his arms across his chest, closes his eyes and says a final prayer and Tryon himself, in time honoured tradition, going down on his watch, muttering: “this is entirely my doing, entirely my fault”.HMS Victoria disappears beneath the Mediterranean’s surfaceBourke – fitter and quicker than his superior – does, with great difficulty, make his escape. A distinguished fellow-escapee is the fevered John Jellicoe, one day himself to be promoted to commander-in-chief of the British Grand Fleet and dispatched to confront a detachment of the German navy off Jutland.Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, one of Tryon’s most vocal critics, also survives by clinging on to rigging.\u0027Made in China’ label helps archaeologists solve 800-year-old mysteryIn total, 358 of Victoria’s complement perished, coincidentally the same number as those believed to have been saved. Six bodies only were taken ashore, along with 173 men injured during the tumult. Jenkins on the Collingwood unarguably rescued more people than any other captain on duty – mainly due to his not recalling his lifeboats.The stricken Camperdown, despite taking 90 minutes to effect partial water resistance, partial stability, somehow managed to keep going, battered, but without loss of life.Back in England, reliable news was scarce. Only Markham’s telegram listing 22 surviving officers was to hand and so thousands of anxious friends and relatives milled round the Admiralty.Anger and sorrow rapidly give way to philanthropy. Within three weeks, a remarkable distress fund of £50,000 was raised for Victoria widows and orphans – the equivalent of more than £5m today.John Jellicoe survived HMS Victoria’s sinking and went on to become Commander-in-Chief of the British Grand FleetDebates raged about whether there should be a public inquiry into the disaster some argued that would hand too many secrets of British seamanship to her enemies. A court martial was opened – Bourke’s second – with reporters allowed to witness some of the proceedings. Bourke requested that any captain sistering the Victoria was exempted as a judge.In the dock, Bourke kept referring to navy ships as if they were on a highway, obeying “rules of the road”. But the very concept of obedience troubled the chief investigator, Sir Michael Culme-Seymour – “a safe pair of hands” – throughout his deliberations.It appeared to be common ground that Markham on the Camperdown should have followed his first instinct and aborted the manoeuvre. But then, had there not been a collision, Markham would have been hauled over the coals for insubordination.Tryon actually gave his orders in person ignoring them was extremely difficult, however foolish and foolhardy they were.HMS Camperdown was commissioned at Portsmouth in 1889Culme-Seymour himself had to walk a tightrope: avoiding any hint at a precedent for altering (let alone ignoring) instructions from above. Tryon’s mental health was queried. Perhaps he was suffering from a brain disease, dementia, when he sent the Victoria to its doom?In the end, Bourke came out best, his reputation undiminished. Markham, meanwhile, was censured almost as much as his flag captain, Charles Johnstone. Both could have acted differently at different stages in the unfolding catastrophe. Markham was stripped of his command, his pay halved, and relegated to minor duties. He died early, aged 65, in 1906.Crucially, Tryon’s philosophy of seamanship was abandoned, history not permitted to be kind to his memory. Of the engaged fleet formation only a repaired Camperdown was still being tossed by high seas in 1898.Like the Hollandia, the Victoria’s wreckage lay undiscovered for a long time. Not until 111 years and two months later, on 22 August 2004, was the ship found, by Austrian-Lebanese er Christian Francis, assisted by British explorer Mark Ellyatt. It was positioned almost vertically, 140 metres below their search vessel. They concluded that a full 30 metres of the Victoria’s bow had buried itself in the seabed.Our fascination with the ocean is ceaseless (PA)Three intriguing footnotes to the sinking of the Victoria continue to tantalise. First, it has long been the legend that, at the very moment of inevitable collision between the Victoria and the Camperdown, Mrs Tryon was hosting a party in her London mansion, when Commander Tryon himself, but ghostlike, descended the staircase to join festivities.Second, one of Tryon’s hobbies was collecting memorabilia connected to his hero, Horatio Nelson. In 2012, Ellyat temporarily retrieved Nelson’s sword from Tryon’s cabin but, unsure what to do with this precious artefact, he hid the discovery in a different part of the wreck where it abides till this day.Third, is the very title “Victoria” fated? After all, it was the MV Princess Victoria, a British Railways’ roll-on, roll-off ferry that sank on its passage from Larne to Stranraer, on 31 January 1953, costing 133 lives (at the start of the weekend of the great Lincolnshire floods, which left many people drowned across East Anglia and the Low Countries).How Chad’s killing fields have been turned into an elephants’ havenHow crowdfunding is enabling indie talent to create graphic novelsWhy women in South Africa are carrying the burden of HIVAnd barely six weeks after that terrible storm, a reordered SS Victoria also sank, this time striking rocks – just as the Hollandia did.Why, though, recognise the anniversary of any ship’s demise when there are no living survivors and nothing to add to any inquest? Well, the lure of the sea still captivates and enchants even the most landlocked of the general population.Despite all its dangers – because of all its dangers – the sea is where many of us are most alive.Isles of Scillyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And a decision will have to be made as to whether we accept it or not.”It adds: “It cannot be right that 650 MPs alone decide whether to accept the deal, without any say for Londoners or people across the country. That’s why we think it’s essential that there is a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, so that 65 million people can have their voices heard as well.”The letter sets out the need to stop Brexit from damaging London’s status as “a cultural capital, a sporting powerhouse” and “a hub for international business, civil society and media”.While it accepts that the 2016 referendum gave the government a mandate to negotiate a withdrawal agreement with Brussels, it says ministers do not have a mandate to “force a bad Brexit deal on our city.”It argues that London, “represents all the most positive elements of being global, outward-looking, welcoming and tolerant. These values form part of the fabric of London. A bad Brexit deal risks tearing that fabric apart.”Up to now Mr Corbyn has doggedly resisted the idea of a public vote on the final deal, saying that the country should “respect” the result of the referendum in June 2016.Ten of the MPs went further\u0026nbspand backed a call for an option in any referendum to be remaining in the EU on current terms.Labour HQ declined to comment on Friday, but the Labour membership, which twice backed Mr Corbyn to lead the party, is believed to be largely against Brexit.While the exact geographical breakdown of Labour’s membership is not public data, insiders say numbers are heavily weighted towards London and other urban centres.Mr Corbyn and the most senior members of his shadow cabinet, like John McDonnell, Diane Abbott, Emily Thornberry, Barry Gardiner and Sir Keir Starmer all hold seats in the capital, which overwhelmingly backed Remain in the referendum.It comes after 12 Welsh Labour MPs, including shadow ministerial aides Anna McMorrin and Tonia Antoniazzi, both defied the party line to sign a similar letter.Five MPs from Labour’s heartlands in the Northeast also signed a letter published by The Independent in May calling for backing the People’s Vote campaign, as did four\u0026nbspMerseyside\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspand the city’s mayor.Last month Janet Daby\u0026nbspdefeated rivals supported by the Corbyn-backing Momentum group and Unite to become Labour’s parliamentary candidate for the Lewisham East byelection next month, having stood on a ticket of fighting to keep the UK in the single market.Anti-Brexit left-wingers announced they will\u0026nbsptour\u0026nbspBritain this summer in a campaign to build opposition to leaving the EU – calling on Mr Corbyn to back Remain and negotiate a “new settlement” with Brussels.The internal struggle in the party could come to a head when the Commons votes on whether to keep the UK in the single market in coming weeks, with Mr Corbyn currently refusing to back the plan.Labour’s current position is that that Britain’s EU membership must end and that the country should leave the\u0026nbspsingle market\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspcustoms union\u0026nbspto negotiate new relationships to replace them.But the House of Lords, including more than 80 Labour peers who rebelled against Mr Corbyn’s will, passed an amendment to Theresa May’s EU Withdrawal Bill that would see the UK remain inside the single market if it also now gets approved by the Commons.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Organisers say Tibet’s involvement has been met with considerable oppositionWhen the Fifa World Cup kicks off less than two weeks from now, the top prize at stake is not really going to be the token £29m handed to the winner, but an unquantifiable sense of national pride.And although it may feel a million miles away from Russia’s 81,000-capacity Luzhniki Stadium, pride is also the most important factor at the rival World Football Cup which began this weekend across a number of little-known non-league grounds orbiting London.Sixteen “members” are taking part in the 10-day tournament run by Conifa, the Confederation of Independent Football Associations, offering a platform for oppressed regions and unrecognised breakaway states that, for one reason or another, have been rejected for membership by Fifa itself. The question is, can their pride be classified as “national”?Conifa has\u0026nbspbeen running the World Football Cup roughly once every two years since 2013, but this year’s tournament is comfortably the biggest.Thursday’s opening match day also boasted some high-profile names – former Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg officiated the first game, former Major League Soccer star James Riley captained a team from the North American “bioregion” Cascadia and there’s a team representing the Ndebele people of\u0026nbspZimbabwe that is coached by former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar.Yet the real stars of the show, and the ones who have proved most controversial, are a team from Tibet. Dispatched to the earthly confines of Enfield and Sutton with a blessing from the Dalai Lama himself, they have been ordered by His Holiness to conduct themselves with “compassion” and “uphold the honour and dignity of the Tibetan people”.That won’t mean pulling out of any 50-50 tackles, the team’s manager Passang Dorjee tells The Independent. But it does bring with it a sense of responsibility to provide “an example for the whole world to see” of what Tibet can achieve when it stands on its own.The Tibet team were\u0026nbsphanded a wildcard to appear at this year’s competition by the organisers, and face an uphill struggle to get out of Group B. They were beaten 3-0 on Thursday\u0026nbspat Enfield Town’s Queen Elizabeth II Stadium by the reigning 2016 champions Abkhazia, a Russia-backed disputed territory in northwestern Georgia. Two more challenges await over the course of the weekend in the form of Northern Cyprus – the Turkish part of the island – and Karpatalya, a Hungarian-speaking enclave of central Europe.But they are the definition of the plucky and popular underdog, boasting an impressive number of supporters and leading out the opening ceremony procession.None of them actually live in the Chinese-administered region that they are in London to represent – Dorjee explains that “because of the political situation, there was no hope at all that Tibetans could come out of Tibet to play in this kind of thing”. The Chinese, he says, are “very strict about who goes in and who comes out”, and those who did play would never be allowed to go back home.Their players come instead from the Tibetan diaspora, most from the mountainous regions of India, Nepal and Bhutan but also some from North America, Europe and two from the UK.While a good number attended the blessing by the Dalai Lama at\u0026nbsphis home in India, the first time the full squad met up and trained together was in London, a week before their first match in the cup.Just having Tibet at the World Football Cup is enough to ruffle feathers, the organisers say. Paul Watson, Conifa’s director, says they had several international brands lined up to provide sponsorship into the six figures until, one by one and,\u0026nbsphe suggests, at China’s behest,\u0026nbspthey asked for Tibet to be kicked out. Only Paddy Power, the bookmaker not alien to controversy itself, remained as the main sponsor.It made financing the competition “really difficult”, Watson told Sky Sports. “People are scared to sponsor an event like this because they’re afraid of offending China.”But, the team’s manager Dorjee stresses,\u0026nbspthe Tibetan football team was not calling for the region to have full independence from China, but rather to be granted more autonomy and have its people’s rights observed.Tibet are not the only participants to come up against opposition. The organisers claim the (Greek) Cypriot government wrote to every council hosting matches – even those where Northern Cyprus were not scheduled to play – telling them they should withdraw from the tournament.But for the players, even at this most unusual and geopolitically charged event, the sport rises above politics.Tenzin Nyendak is one of the two British members of the Tibet squad. The 30-year-old centre-half moved to the UK nine years ago from Bylakuppe, a town in southern India with a Tibetan diaspora second only to Dharamsala – where the Dalai Lama lives.He has never actually played for a league club in London, but as one of the stars of London Tibetan Football Club has travelled across Europe to compete against other teams of Tibetans in exile.Nyendak tells The Independent it is “a privilege to be part of the national team squad… I am really proud to represent Tibet globally.”He says that football is the closest thing Tibetans have to a national sport, and he believes the team will be backed “by all Tibetans, in and outside Tibet”. Unable to travel from London, he was disappointed to miss out on the pre-tournament audience with the Dalai Lama – who has said in the past that he enjoys watching football when he can.Yet in spite of all that, Nyendak would not be drawn on what his manager referred to as the “political situation”. “We take it as a sporting event, we don’t want to involve football with politics,” he says.“We came here to play. Playing football and winning the tournament are the only objectives we have.”Tibet’s chances of proceeding to the knockout stages of the cup, let alone winning it, will depend much on their result against Northern Cyprus, again in Enfield, on Saturday evening.Either way, it won’t matter too much to their manager, Dorjee.“We are just proud to get this golden opportunity to represent Tibet at Conifa,” he says. “When we hear our national anthem, and we can see our national flags flying in the ground, it makes us realise we have already achieved a lot.“Winning and losing is not important. The important thing is to say that we are here, we Tibetans can also play football, and to show that we have equality.”Tibet lost 3-1 to Northern Cyprus in Saturday\u0027s matchor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It says the programme is carried out in accordance with the International Convention for Regulation of Whaling.“Whales are already facing substantial threats including bycatch in fisheries and marine pollution,” Ms Wellbelove said. ”Significant conservation efforts are underway worldwide to address these issues, so the least Japan could do is put away the harpoons.“The continued killing of any whales is abhorrent to modern society, but these new figures make it even more shocking. We look forward to Australia and other pro-conservation countries sending the strongest possible message to Japan that it should stop its lethal whaling programme.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper said Mr Soder said afterwards that the Vatican’s attitude was supportive.“Söder did not talk to Francis about the so-called crucifixion, which came into force this Friday in Bavaria. However, subsequently the State Secretariat had expressed a ‘fundamental benevolence’ towards initiatives of a ‘Christian confession to the outside’ as well as the Bavarian care and family allowance,” the Frankfurter Allgemeine reported.The Secretariat of State is responsible for general church affairs.Bavaria is Germany’s second-most populous state, and three in four citizens are Christians. It has one of the highest densities of Catholics in Europe – half of all its people, while 19 per cent are Protestant and 4 per cent are Muslim.Authorities say the new law is about culture, not religion. The decree reads: A clearly visible cross must be placed in the entrance area of every service building to serve as a reminder of the historical and cultural influence of Bavaria.A poll across Germany showed just 29 per cent of citizens supported the move but in Bavaria, more than half did so – 56 per cent. Among supporters of Mr Soder\u0027s political opponents, the Alternativ fur Deutschland, more than three-quarters\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsp77 per cent – approved.However, several art colleges have rebelled, saying their campuses were erse institutions, leading authorities to reportedly backtrack on the obligation for museums, theatres and universities, and saying now that a crucifix is only recommended.A lack of specific instructions about sizes and placement means the crosses could be very small, so long as they are visible in the foyer.Since chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed the influx of migrants into Germany in 2015 and 2016, the role of Islam in German society has been much debated.Mr Söder and his party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), have been accused of using populist strategies to garner support ahead of state elections in October. The party’s absolute majority is under threat, with conservative voters shifting support to the right-wing AfD following the refugee crisis of 2015-2016.The Kreuzpflicht - or cross duty - is seen as Mr Söder’s answer to the arrival of the mostly Muslim refugees.\u0026nbspBut Cardinal Reinhard Marx, archbishop of Munich and president of the German Bishops\u0027 Conference, accused the premier of using it to foment ision, unrest and animosity. Thomas Sternberg, President of the Central Committee of German Catholics, said the crucifix should not be used for election purposes.\u0026nbspIn February, Bavaria banned full-face Islamic veils in schools, universities, polling stations and government offices.Earlier this week Denmark banned the wearing of face veils in public, after the government argued veils were contrary to Danish values.\u0026nbspor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men. But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime. And he was acquitted along with the others.But Scott maintains Thorpe wanted him dead and said he only felt safe when the politician died in 2014.His younger self has been played by actor Ben Wishaw in the new BBC drama starring Hugh Grant called Very English Scandal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000409234441.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"davina mccall hysterical presenting ae live ally ross","story":"Presenters must tilt their head and go all gooey whenever they mention this “National treasure”.Quiz show contestants are given a special ovation just for revealing: “I work in the NHS.”There are awards shows in its honour now on both BBC1 and ITV, whose version was attended, last week, by a glittering array of tax exiles giving eulogies that would make Kim Jong-un blush.Some of it is undoubtedly sincere. Some is also done to shut down anything other than the argument that says “It needs more money”, while other bits are there just because TV executives have noticed it’s the NHS’s 70th birthday and think they’d better do something to look caring.Like, for instance, ITV’s A\u0026ampE Live, “from the frontline”, at Leeds General Infirmary.A self-defeating three-day experiment which, on the one hand gleefully promised us all sorts of carnage: “It’s hotting up here.” But on the other was swift to assure viewers they were operating on a time delay in case patients refused filming consent, thereby ruling out most of the drunks and any possibility of a bloke being wheeled into reception with a Hoover attachment up his fundament.I’d avoid describing LGI as the most sedate-looking A\u0026ampE unit in Britain, though, because ITV had attempted to redress the noise balance by having it hosted by human Tannoy system Davina McCall, who lost little time in telling us: “I had to get hypnotised to do this job, can you believe it?”Yeah, I can, actually.“I saw my granny sever her toes with a lawnmower,” she went on to explain, “and it made me squeamish.” If you thought for one minute, however, it sedated her, you either overestimate the powers of hypnotherapy or you haven’t been watching Davina’s career closely enough.The woman was in full Street Mates mode from the moment she clocked a young couple in the waiting room. “Are you going out?” said Davina, without so much as checking their vital signs.“We were on a date . . . our first date.”“AH-MAY-ZING! THIS IS GREAT. And it’s something to talk about when you have children . . . ”Silence. “I took it too far, didn’t I?”You did rather, Davina, though I get the squeamishness thing and actually flinched when she then told us: “A 23-year-old man, Tommy, is being brought in by ambulance after being rear-ended at high speed.”You’d hope Tommy got some of Davina’s meds as well, ’cos a weird thing happened on Wednesday and Thursday’s broadcasts.She actually calmed down a bit. To the extent I finally noticed the staff, who turned out to be naturals in front of a camera, which really shouldn’t have been a surprise given TV’s insatiable appetite for this sort of show.Among other recent TV offerings, we have: A\u0026ampE Live, A\u0026ampE, 24 Hours In A\u0026ampE, The Real A\u0026ampE, Sun Sea \u0026amp A\u0026ampE, A\u0026ampE On The Road.And that’s just the ones with A\u0026ampE in the title.There’s a whole load more with the words ambulance and emergency, which you may also have watched but entirely forgotten.Why?’Cos an actual visit to A\u0026ampE is a real, vivid, frightening, frustrating, disturbing, impressive and unforgettable experience that can leave you weeping with gratitude for the NHS.TV, by contrast, generally offers a dumb, censored, antiseptic, grovelling, uncritical, cult-like, agenda-ridden version, with this sort of dialogue.Davina (to ambulanceman Gavin): “How important is it you get there early.”“The sooner we get there the more chance the patient has of surviving.”“And that’s so important, isn’t it?”Thank you, live TV. Where would we all be without you?Good Morning Britain’s Piers Morgan: “I leave a lot of phones in my bedroom, ’cos you never know when you’re going to get THE call when your manager says, ‘Got it. Prime-time America. You’re back on’.”And it’s go go go with My 600lb Life.NOTE: In order to avoid Britain’s Got Talent Live, I’m heading south of the border, down Mexico way. Column returns in a fortnight.BBC1’s version of the Jeremy Thorpe murder plot saga, A Very English Scandal, is nuts.It’s very entertaining as well, but it is nuts, with CGI badgers running around in episode one and a couple of Yucca plants shoved in some sand dunes to try and make us think North Devon is actually “California,” on Sunday night.The main issue, however, is that A Very English Scandal can’t quite decide if it’s a comedy or not. So it’s deadly serious whenever Thorpe’s commenting on Europe, immigration or gay rights, but pure Carry On when his ex-lover Norman Scott starts having it off in a caravan with the bird out of Torchwood.It’s more than saved, though, by the incredible storyline and performances of the brilliant Alex Jennings, who totally vanishes into the part of Thorpe’s sidekick, Peter Bessell, Patricia Hodge as Ursula Thorpe, and Ben Whishaw, who’s got the most difficult role of all as the insanely irritating Scott, but does it well enough to make me wish he’d been shot on Exmoor rather than his dog.In that sort of company, of course, it was also incredibly brave to give the lead role to Hugh Grant, who never quite convinces me he’s anyone other than Hugh Grant, yet I will say this for a performance that stands out from anything he’s ever done before.He’s wearing a hat.Courtesy of ITV’s Lee Dixon on England’s World Cup goalies: “You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a nervous one.”“You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a Neville Swan.”INCIDENTALLY, who claimed the following, last week: “People always get excited about cockchafers.”EASIEST gig on the soaps?EastEnders’ Big Mo, who’s just set herself up as Walford’s resident psychic and fortune teller.A job with my name on it, frankly, as I wouldn’t need a crystal ball, money or much encouragement to tell the locals: “This old craphole will be locked in an ever more depressing cycle of baby abductions, love triangles, disrupted weddings, head transplants and escaped animals from now until kingdom come. Get the hell out, while you still can.”Walford CID might also want to put me on a profiling retainer as well, given they’re the only people who haven’t noticed that every single street crime, including – surprise, surprise – last week’s stabbings of Keanu and Shakil, has been carried out by a white, working-class male with a bad stage school Cockney accent.I guess Big Mo’s probably safe in the position for the moment, though, as she seems to have foretold the re-appearance of Shane “Alfie” Richie in The Vic, earlier this month.However, at roughly the same time, she also predicted: “Jean (Slater) will get a job with teeth.”This Morning, “Earth Angel” Sarah Rebecca Vine: “I am a spiritual life coach and healer and, I feel, a messenger to wake people up.” Zzzzz.And First Time Mum, Ferne McCann: “The hypnotherapist session definitely calmed me down and emptied my mind.” Of what?The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “On the flag of South Sudan blue represents the waters of what major river?”Bradley Walsh: “What UK Prime Minister read geography at an all- women’s Oxford college?”Jackie: “Tony Blair.”Bradley Walsh: “In a hospital, the H\u0026ampN unit refers to the head and what other part of the body?”Jackie: “Nose.”And Ben Shephard: “In Australia and New Zealand a ‘long black’ is a variety of which hot beverage?”Teri: “Beer.”The BBC’s Friday night schedule offering us two left-wing panel shows (HIGNFY and New World Order), featuring ’s Mona Chalabi, when one was far too many.The A\u0026ampE Live caption writer responsible for the spelling of “interupt”.

An experience which really is as pointless and empty as Tight Fit performing The Lion Sleeps Tonight, without Steve Grant on lead vocals.Brilliant performances from Alex Jennings, Patricia Hodge and Ben Whishaw, as Peter Bessell, Jeremy Thorpe’s mum and Norman Scott, on A Very English Scandal.BBC1’s Motty: The Man Behind The Sheepskin, revealing an even odder character than I was expecting.

In the US — officially the world’s fattest nation — that figure is 18.5 per cent.UK stores now stock plus-size clothes for under-tens, with H\u0026ampM becoming the latest chain to sell a “generous fit” range for kids as young as eight.Obesity is predicted to double in the next 25 years — while tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has already been thrown at the problem.But a simple — and cheap — solution can already be found on the playgrounds and fields of around 6,000 primary schools where more than a million children take part in the Daily Mile.The exercise regime means that at some point in every school day, pupils leave their classroom, still in their uniform, to run, jog or walk for up to 15 minutes.Youngsters can set their own pace and talk to their friends while they go round.Most of the children complete a mile or more in the quarter of an hour.Teachers all over the country have reported how pupils return to the classroom invigorated and eager to learn after doing what is being called “jography”.Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May praised the Daily Mile and called on schools to take it up — but stopped short of saying it should be compulsory.Now, for all our kids’ sakes, The Sun is calling on Education Secretary Damian Hinds to make the Daily Mile mandatory in all primary schools.The idea began six years ago and has been growing steadily. But only now have scientists been able to prove it really does have an effect.Over the course of an academic year, a team of experts from Stirling University compared nearly 400 children, aged four to 11, from two primaries, with one group doing the Daily Mile and the other not.The Daily Mile kids were put through a series of tests to calculate whether they became fitter and whether they lost fat.IF you are a teacher or parent who would like to get your school doing the Daily Mile check out thedailymile or go to @_thedailymile or on Facebook. There is lots of information showing how easy it is to incorporate the Daily Mile and to support schools who want to get involved. You can also register your interest.The findings, which have just been released, show how they lost an average of four per cent body fat.They were also fitter and more active during the day, while time spent sitting around dropped by an average 18 per cent.Another investigation, conducted at an inner city school in London, found Daily Mile youngsters did much better than expected in SATS tests.Other tests have shown how children also feel less stressed and more confident.Retired head Elaine Wyllie, 62, came up with the idea of the Daily Mile almost by accident when pupils at her St Ninians school in Stirling wanted to get fitter.After just six weeks, not one of the 57 children in her first year was overweight.But to persuade the Government to introduce the Daily Mile into all Britain’s 20,000 primary schools, scientific proof was needed.After reading the latest results from Stirling University, Elaine said: “I knew this research would be the game-changer which would prove what I had believed all along — that the Daily Mile makes children fitter, happier, more active and a healthier weight.“I am delighted and relieved that we now have objective proof.”But education chiefs appear reluctant to make the Daily Mile compulsory for fear of upsetting head teachers, who might see it as an extra burden on their staff.However, Jim Cleaver, head of Westgate Community Primary in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, says: “The beauty of the Daily Mile is its simplicity.“It takes 15 minutes out of the day and for staff it is as easy as opening a door.”At Woodlands, a school for children with special needs in Leatherhead, Surrey, lead nurse Emma Packham has seen children lose weight as a result of the Daily Mile.She says: “We had five children who were clinically obese whose weight was just going up, up, up.“Since we started 18 months ago nobody in the target group has gained weight. Some have lost weight.No other factors in their lives have changed.”It is not just the children’s weight that is changing. Teachers are reporting that behaviour in classroom is improving. And many parents say their children sleep better at night.Former MP Andy Burnham, now the Mayor of Manchester, is a fan and wants his city to become the first where every primary school does the Daily Mile.Unlike some schemes, there would be no costs with introducing it into schools. All associated expenses are currently being paid by Britain’s richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, who has also used some of his £21billion fortune to advertise it during Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.Sports commentator Jake Humphrey, who runs the Daily Mile with youngsters at Trowse primary school in Norwich, says: “I honestly don’t think parents are aware of how unfit their children are.

Some Italians told me unelected bankers and institutions in Brussels were being put first. They have a point.The EU and Italy’s President now need to tread incredibly carefully. The 5-Star Movement is already mobilising voters through street protests. The League party is calling on them to vent their frustration at the banks and financial markets.Yesterday, one EU official suggested the financial markets would teach Italian voters a lesson by withdrawing investment from the country. This will only pour gasoline on the populist fire.So, what happens next? The populists will almost certainly sweep to another victory at fresh elections, possibly triggering a new financial crisis and creating another major headache in Brussels. One of the parties might also propose a referendum on Italy’s euro membership.It seems very likely this chaos is not going anywhere anytime soon and the EU will soon be presented with yet another crisis.The events in Italy have clear implications for the Brexit debate. The EU has struggled to make sense of why Leavers opted for Brexit, just as today they are struggling to make sense of the mood in Italy.Many Leavers voted for Brexit because they felt the EU was not able to manage its own affairs, and they will see Italy as further evidence of that.But also many Leavers were anxious that the European Union allows very little room for other political views and they will see that as well in the Italy crisis.While the president was acting in the remit of his constitutional office, the problem is that many Italians and Europeans feel this is an example of Europe’s inability to accept any opposition to the euro single currency.It seems difficult to see how this crisis can be resolved without a more openly Eurosceptic Italy — and without a populist government at the head of the eurozone’s third largest economy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I told him how much he was loved, how much he would be missed and how proud we all were of him, amongst lots of other things.I also made a number of promises to him. Ones that I will never break.And one of those promises I made was that no matter what happens, I would always care for and look after his gorgeous mummy for him.So I asked Connie if she would do me the honour of becoming my wife and sharing mine and our beautiful sons surname.

Me and the soon-to-be Mrs Gard will make sure of it.Mr Gard and Ms Yates, who are in their 30s and come from Bedfont, west London, had asked the High Court to rule that Charlie should be allowed to undergo a therapy trial in New York.Doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London said the therapy would not help and said life-support treatment should stop.Mr Justice Francis ruled in favour of Great Ormond Street after analysing the case at hearings in the Family Division of the High Court in London.Charlies parents failed to overturn the ruling in the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court.They also failed to persuade European Court of Human Rights judges to intervene.The couple raised more than £1.3million to pay for therapy in America and said they wanted to establish a foundation with the donations.Charlie suffered from a rare genetic condition, called mitochondrial depletion syndrome, which causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage.His parents say they want to raise awareness of the condition by launching their foundation.Our vision is to enhance the quality of life for mitochondrial sufferers through innovative research, family support, and raise much-needed awareness for this devastating condition, they said in a statement on the Charlie Gard Foundation website.Mitochondrial-related diseases kill more children than childhood cancers, and its our vision to change this statistic.Our aims are to deliver hope for a brighter future - and one day find that all-elusive cure - and ensure we provide mito sufferers with every opportunity to get the very best out of life.They also promised to be there for families at every stage of your journey and recognise that memory making and family time is of the utmost importance."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nintchdbpict000410186012.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"aureus school oxfordshire bans packed lunches halal gluten","story":"Aureus School in Didcot, Oxford, has sparked fury among parents for its strict stance on its food policy.But executive headteacher Hannah Wilson maintains she’s merely encouraging kids to eat healthy food amid concerns about obesity.She said pupils and staff dine together in the canteen, making lunchtimes a social affair.The teacher told the Oxford Mail : Food education closes the poverty gap and delicious, nutritious should be a universal entitlement.With all of the headlines about food banks and obesity, we are preparing our students for healthy lifestyles in the future.Students and staff get to choose from eating a hot halal meat meal, hot gluten-free vegetarian meal, a jacket potato, a salad, a pasta pot or a baguette.And the school insists that only water may be drunk on site because “hydrated brains learn better”.But a father, who asked not to be named, said the rules were “draconian”.He said: We are thinking of taking her out of the school - its getting silly and more like a dictatorship. Their views are quite extreme.Its about choice. Its supposed to be an inclusive school but they are only catering for one particular religion.The dad added that he had tried to get the policies changed since September but had been unsuccessful.The schools frequently-asked questions addresses the food policies and states: What we eat is a key influencer on our performance.When we eat well, we sleep well, when we sleep well, we perform well.We strive at Aureus to create good habits that will become lifelong routines.Sitting down to eat together once a day is an important part of our school culture and ethos.All staff sit and eat, but also bond and talk, with our students. These relationships are key in nurturing our school community.By ensuring that all students have access to a daily nutritious home-cooked family meal we ensure that all have this equality of opportunity.Reiterating the Halal kitchen policy, the document states this is to “celebrate the diversity of our country’s culture”.In 2013 a Government-backed report compiled by the founders of restaurant chain Leon encouraged more headteachers to consider banning packed lunches.It stated: We were approached by many free schools who wanted advice on setting up a first-class food service.Among other things, we always advised them to ban packed lunches from the start.The report noted the rising obesity rates with children and added: Many parents mistakenly imagine that a packed lunch is the healthiest option.In fact, it is far easier to get the necessary nutrients into a cooked meal – even one of mediocre quality.Only one per cent of packed lunches meet the nutritional standards that currently apply to school food."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nintchdbpict000407604800.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle doria ragland mum favourite royal wedding","story":"Aside from watching her daughter and Harry recite their vows, Doria Ragland said her highlight of the big day was meeting the Queen.Dressed in an Oscar de la Renta dress and coat, she was the only family member present to support Meghan at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle.A source told US Weekly: Doria is saying the biggest highlight of the wedding, of course after watching her daughter say ‘I do’ to the man she loves, was meeting the queen.It would have been extremely intimidating for anyone, but Meghan and Harry really did a marvellous job of preparing her (with) what to expect.The source added that Prince Harry told his new mother-in-law numerous stories about the Queen as a grandmother and what she (means)to him.Doria also met Prince William, Kate Middleton, Prince George and Princess Charlotte in the run-up to the wedding on May 19.The 61-year-old charmed her new in-laws -

Since then the number of people waiting more than four hours in A\u0026ampE is up 842 per cent. Then 9,022 people waited more than four hours – in March it was 76,054. An extra 1.4 million people are on NHS waiting lists compared to 2012. And the number of people waiting over two weeks for urgent cancer treatment has more than doubled from 53,738 in 2013 to 113,373 in 2018.  There are 7,000 fewer beds available in NHS hospitals now than in 2012 And bed occupancy at the end of last year was the highest recorded. Stats also show the waiting time measure for consultant-led treatment is at 22 weeks, and has been above the 18-week target since early 2016. Mr Madders said: “Nearly six years of Jeremy Hunt has taken the NHS to a place we haven’t seen since the last Tory Government nearly finished it.” Labour\u0027s view  By Justin Madders   Shadow Health Minister  Our NHS nears its 70th birthday in crisis – yet Jeremy Hunt today becomes its longest-serving Health Secretary ever. How has this master of incompetence kept his job for five years and 273 days of failure? Of successive unprecedented winter crises? Of an extra 1.4m people on the waiting lists? Of an 842 per cent rise in people waiting over four hours in A\u0026ampE? Or a staff shortfall of 100,000? Perhaps Theresa May is so weak she cannot afford any more ex-ministers on the backbenches. We are used to Tory ministers taking no responsibility for their shortcomings. From education, to transport, to law and order, they wreak havoc and misery without consequence on hardworking people. But it’s in health where failure is most pronounced.

The youngster, who got hooked after seeing adverts for betting websites at a football match, committed credit card fraud for a year. He blew \u0026pound60,000 in a week-long online betting binge which left his parents horrified. Today the lad – whose identity we are protecting – talks about his addiction as new Government figures reveal he is one of 25,000 children aged 11-16 who are hooked on gambling. The schoolboy started betting online after going with his \u0026shycompany director dad to Wembley, where he saw adverts for online bookies on screens and on boards around the pitch. He took pictures of his dad’s business credit cards on his smartphone and set up an \u0026shyaccount online under his parent’s identity. Within days he was hooked, getting a massive high from his wins – but placing bigger and bigger bets. He was staking as much as \u0026pound3,000 at a time and placing hundreds of bets a week. The boy, from Lancashire, said: “I had no idea that \u0026shygambling could be an addiction like smoking, drinking or drugs. It seemed like fun and I thought I would make money too. “It was just far too easy. I just had to put in dad’s name, \u0026shyaddress, date of birth and card details and checked a box saying I was 18 – it took literally seconds to register and start gambling.”  His spiralling losses were \u0026shydiscovered six months later when his father got a call from the bank questioning transactions and money missing from the account. By this time, the lad had \u0026shyalready accumulated losses in excess of \u0026pound20,000. Confronted by his parents, he instantly confessed. Following psychotherapy, his parents assumed their son had learned his lesson. But several months later he went on a week-long gambling binge \u0026shyusing the same card details, this time building up debts of a further \u0026pound60,000. Now the parents say they can \u0026shynever trust their son again as they are \u0026shycrippled by loans they were forced to take out to pay debts. Their son still only 15, said: “I am sorry for what I have done. I feel like I’ve ruined everything and our lives will never be the same again.”  He spoke out with the agreement of his parents who want to warn other families about the dangers of online gambling – at any age. He said: “I remember being at Wembley seeing all those adverts, hearing guys around me bragging how much money they’d won and figured I’d give it a go. It seemed fun and easy. “I knew dad’s business was doing well and thought he’d be less likely to spot that than \u0026shymoney coming out of a personal account.” His father’s groundworks firm had a turnover of over \u0026pound30,000 a month and dozens of contractors so his betting went unnoticed at first.  He said: “I started off placing small \u0026pound5 or \u0026pound10 bets on football matches and horses, and had a few wins, which was a massive buzz. It felt like free money. I only regretted not placing bigger bets on my wins, ignoring my losses, and started going bigger and bigger. “I was placing \u0026pound100 bets, and then a few weeks later I was regularly betting \u0026pound1,000 a day. “By then I was down by several thousand pounds, and the only way I could think of \u0026shygetting it back was by more betting. “I was spending around six hours a day betting or researching bets. I missed football training, I skipped homework. Betting was the only thing I could think about.” When his father got the call from the bank and checked the statements, he and his wife knew straight away what was going on. The 43-year-old company \u0026shydirector said: “We were just so angry, not just at him, but also at ourselves for having been naive and trusting. “We had been so \u0026shypreoccupied with our own lives we hadn’t noticed his school grades going down.” The boy started weekly one-to-one sessions with psychotherapist Steve Pope along with weekly group sessions with other addicts. But five months later he had a relapse. He found his dad’s wallet with a credit card and went on a week-long \u0026pound60,000 gambling binge. He said: “It was like this monster in my head calling me to go back.”  A week later his dad had \u0026shyanother call from the bank saying the huge amount had gone. The father said: “I seriously thought our business and our house would be lost. “We had to make a couple of redundancies. We couldn’t even tell those employees the real reason why this had happened. We felt simply terrible.” The father says they will be paying back the loan for the foreseeable future. He said: “We are lucky that we didn’t lose everything. “Now other children might start stealing or securing loans to pay for their \u0026shygambling \u0026shyaddiction. “It’s as bad as \u0026shybeing a heroin addict – the lack of trust, the secrecy, the deceit, but without the obvious signs of drug addiction.” Politicians are calling for \u0026shybetting companies to face the same advertising regulations as tobacco firms in a bid to stem the epidemic of child gamblers. Earlier this week a cross-party group of MPs wrote an open letter to Culture Secretary Matthew Hancock insisting on a gambling ad ban during live sporting events and before the watershed. They claim that an increasing number of gambling adverts are now being aimed at children. The number of 16-year-olds hooked on gambling has risen by a third in the last three years, according to Government regulator the Gambling Commission. Telltale signs of a child addict How to spot signs your child is a problem gambler  Unexplained absences from school or classes Sudden drop in grades or failure to complete assignments on time Change of personality or behaviour Exaggerated display of money or other material possessions Unusual interest in newspapers/magazines/sports scores Borrowing or stealing money Withdrawing from family and friends Uncharacteristically forgetting appointments or dates  Therapist warns of epidemic The psychotherapist treating the schoolboy has warned that gambling is now causing more problems than street drugs among children. Steve Pope said: “These kids get hooked and once they feel the buzz they can’t stop. It’s a silent epidemic and we’re all walking blindly into this without a clue as to the real scale of the problem. “Gambling is just as damaging as cigarettes, or even more so because it’s openly advertised everywhere in such a fun, exciting way, but the long-term consequences are very, very real and disastrous.” Steve added: “I’ve been working in addiction recovery for over 30 years, and I’m staggered at how many gambling addicts under the age of 20 are coming through my doors.” "},{"url":null,"title":"disgraced solicitor who preyed sick","story":"NewsDisgraced solicitor who preyed on sick miners uses compensation cash to buy £2.8m mansion in WAG capital of UKAndrew Nulty snapped up a six-bedroom home with a pool, tennis court and sauna in an area favoured by multi-millionaire footballers and their wives\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAlan Selby20:34, 2 JUN 2018Updated21:35, 2 JUN 2018NewsThe home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, which was purchased by Andrew Nulty\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA disgraced solicitor who preyed on sick miners has used compensation cash he skimmed off to buy a \u0026pound2.8million mansion in \u0026shyBritain’s WAG capital. Andrew Nulty snapped up a six-bedroom home with a pool, tennis court and sauna in an area favoured by multi-millionaire footballers and their wives. Stars who have lived in posh Wilmslow, Cheshire, include Wayne Rooney, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo. Mr Nulty, 49, was branded a “disgrace to the profession” and struck off for breaking rules to amass his fortune from mine workers’ compo claims. Last night miners said the house was an insult after thousands he targeted died from horrific diseases they caught after inhaling pit dust.  Chris Kitchen, general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, said: “It’s wrong Mr Nulty is still living the high life off his ill-gotten gains, especially seeing as most of his claims were for people who are probably no longer with us. “We still deal with a lot of people suffering with pneumoconiosis. It’s not a nice disease.” Mr Nulty took home \u0026pound13million in a single year by exploiting the Coal Health Compensation Scheme. His firm raised \u0026pound40million by processing at least 32,000 claims from pitmen and their families after the scheme. He advertised his services as free, but as well as a flat rate from the Government he took 15 per cent of some payouts in fees. This was paid back in 2005.  He committed no criminal offence but the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal struck him off for breaching Law Society rules on a number of charges – including failing to give adequate information to clients and taking a 15 per cent cut of any damages some received. At the time a spokesman said: “He preyed on sick men who were not used to dealing with the legal profession and shafted them. “It was a total dereliction of a solicitor’s obligations to his clients.” "},{"url":null,"title":"everyone knows who done it","story":"News\u0027Everyone knows who done it\u0027: Holidaymaker claims whole neighbourhood knows who vandalised car with \u0027No Parking\u0027 paintBenny Finkelstein\u0027s car was daubed with paint after he parked it in a residential street and flew off on holiday\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByCharlotte CoxTim Wyatt20:59, 2 JUN 2018NewsTwo cars were vandalised with the words NO PARKING in paint when they were parked up on Lownorth Road in Wythenshawe.

The words \u0027No parkin\u0027 were slathered over Benny Finkelstein\u0027s red Hyundai in white paint last month. One of the car\u0027s tyres was also slashed. The 34-year-old had parked his car on a residential street in Wythenshawe around the corner from Manchester\u0027s airport before jetting off for an 18-day holiday in Israel. The Manchester resident said he was shocked to discover the damage on his return because he had used the area for free parking many times before.     The local police force tweeted an image of the cars and branded the incident completely unacceptable but Finkelstein said the police don\u0027t care about what had happened.  I understand the frustration of citizens in this area but they can’t come and just do what they want to, he told the Manchester Evening News .  “Does that mean I can go and start painting people’s houses in that area and have no penalty? “It feels like there are no rules in this neighbourhood. I’ve no doubt everyone who lives there knows who did this. But there is nothing being done by the police.”  He added: “All the cars have private driveways, nobody has the right to decide if I can park on the street or not It was parked legally, I’ve done it many times before.” Benny says he spoke to a resident who told him of their frustration over unofficial meet and greet firms using their streets to ‘dump’ cars. He added: “She knew who had done it, I think everyone in this neighbourhood does but they won’t tell. “I’m pretty sure they are happy as it means they can get parking permits.” Benny says he paid \u0026pound100 for a car wash to remove the water-based paint but he’s yet to replace the tyre. The attack comes amid residents’ growing frustration over holidaymakers and airport staff parking their cars in communities around the hub.

Cops, their families and members of the public yesterday bombarded the firm\u0027s Facebook page with negative reviews in retaliation for an anti-police advertising campaign that accused officers of being paid to lie.   There was a huge backlash over the shocking posters that popped up in windows of Lush stores and appeared on the firm\u0027s website .  Lush argued it was simply shining a light on intrusive, abusive, political policing amid an ongoing public inquiry into undercover officers\u0027 secretive activities. But critics said the posters were a disgrace and an insult to hard-working, front-line officers. Police and their relatives got revenge by posting negative, one-star reviews on Lush\u0027s Facebook page, leaving the profile awash with scathing remarks. But some later claimed their reviews were deleted or their Facebook accounts suspended within hours of writing comments about Lush.  Lush however denies removing, blocking or deleting one-star reviews. One customer said: Last night I left a one-star review as a result of their recent campaign. I used to be a loyal customer, spent far too much of my hard-earned money in their stores. This morning, my Facebook account had been locked out following a report of suspicious activity. I had to change my password, verify comments I had made, and go through a lot of drama to get back into my account. My review of Lush UK has mysteriously disappeared.  Another asked: Are Lush just going to delete every one star review and negative feedback comment on Facebook, then block the person who leaves it, such as myself, my friends and police colleagues have been? One said: Dear Lush, why are you deleting and blocking anyone who has left you a 1 star review? Another accused Lush of falsely report(ing) peoples profiles as hacked so that you can delete their reviews and boost your ratings is disgraceful and totally unethical. A Lush spokesman said in response to criticism on Facebook: I can confirm that we are not removing or blocking any comments or deleting posts. This is not an anti-state/anti-police campaign. We are aware that the police forces of the UK are doing an increasingly difficult and dangerous job whilst having their funding slashed. We fully support them in having proper police numbers, correctly funded to fight crime, violence and to be there to serve the public at our times of need.  This campaign is not about the real police work done by those front line officers who support the public every day - it is about a controversial branch of political undercover policing that ran for many years before being exposed.  Our campaign is to highlight this small and secretive subset of undercover policing that undermines and threatens the very idea of democracy. There is an age old understanding that our government and public institutions are there to protect and preserve the rights and safety of the public.  In the case of these secretive undercover units, their work went well beyond the boundaries of acceptable police tactics and is now the subject of an ongoing public inquiry, which was instigated by Theresa May during her time as Home Secretary when the scale and scope of the breaches of protocols started to become clear.  This public inquiry needs help from the public to keep it on track and ensure that this one opportunity for full honesty and disclosure is not lost or squandered. All citizens should be concerned when human rights are abandoned by those in power. The police themselves have admitted in their public apology to seven of the females deceived into long-term relationships with police spies, that these actions were a violation of the women’s human rights, an abuse of police power and caused significant trauma”. In a recent court case the police admitted the actions amounted to inhumane and degrading treatment breaching Article 3 of the European Declaration of Human Rights. Those victims are now asking that the public inquiry demands that the undercover units release a full list of the undercover names used by their operatives, release a list of which campaign groups were targeted, and also that they release the information and data entries they hold on individuals whose lives and homes were infiltrated during these operations. Without this full disclosure there is no way of knowing the full extent of what happened during the dark years of this renegade secret policing operation - and that full disclosure might not happen unless the public demand it.

Dressed in a beautiful Oscar de la Renta dress and coat, she captured the nation\u0027s hearts as the only family member present to support Meghan on the special day. But there was another moment during the wedding weekend that reportedly became Doria\u0027s biggest highlight of the event.

It would have been extremely intimidating for anyone, but Meghan and Harry really did a marvellous job of preparing her [with] what to expect.  And Prince Harry told his new mother-in-law numerous stories about the Queen as a grandmother and what she [means] to him, the source added. People have also noticed that Doria and the Queen were both wearing shades of green on the big day.  When Doria arrived in the UK, she had a whirlwind 48 hours meeting members of Prince Harry\u0027s close family including Charles and Camilla and of course the Queen. She had afternoon tea with the Queen and Prince Philip at Windsor Castle, along with Meghan and Harry.  Doria also met Prince William, Kate Middleton, Prince George and Princess Charlotte in the run-up to the wedding. And she charmed her new in-laws during all the meet and greets.

The mother of James Bulger has picked up the keys to a brand new holiday lodge, creating a legacy to her son which will be reflected in the smiles of hundreds of struggling kids. James Bulger House will serve as a place of sanctuary for victims of crime and families who are disadvantaged or have lost loved ones. James was a month away from his third birthday when he was taken from a shopping centre by two ten-year-old boys on February 12, 1993. He was tortured, abused and murdered. He would have been 28 this year. Paying tribute to wellwishers who helped raise \u0026pound200,000 to make her vision come true, Denise said: “My James would be so proud.” It is the culmination of a project that began with the launch of the James Bulger Memorial Trust in 2008. Since then, Denise and husband Stuart have been letting hundreds of families stay in their static caravan on a holiday site near Blackpool. It was a way of putting some happiness into other children’s lives – but also a way to say thank you for the outpouring of love and support Denise has had ever since James’s murder. And seeing the difference that small gesture made to so many, they were keen to turn it into something more.  Denise said: “The support from everyone has been incredible. “Our dream was to be able to raise the money to upgrade the holiday home to a stunning lodge – and I’m excited that, with the donations and fundraising, we’ve managed to fulfil this.” The lodge at Ribby Hall, in Lytham St Annes, Lancs, was also designed to be fully wheelchair accessible, allowing the Trust to extend its mission to families unable to use the caravan. Denise added: “I can’t thank everyone enough, it’s been a very emotional 12 months. Being handed the keys this week has filled me with pride and love.” TV presenter Sir Trevor McDonald has backed the family – and helped with their fundraising efforts at a star-studded black tie ball in March. He has also made an ITV documentary to mark the 25th anniversary of James’s killing. Sir Trevor said: “I’m over the moon that Denise and Stuart have managed to reach their target and obtain their dream lodge in James’s memory. “They do so much great work with the James Bulger Memorial Trust – it’s really special they do so much for other people.” James’s killers Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were only ten years old when they became the country’s youngest murderers for 250 years. They took little James’s hand and led him away from a busy shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, while Denise was in a butcher’s shop. They walked him for two and half miles to a railway line, where they tortured, beat and sexually assaulted him. Venables and Thompson then lay him across railway tracks, hoping he would be hit by a train to make the murder look like an accident. His body was discovered two days later. In January this year, Denise released I Let Him Go, a book detailing her anguish since James was taken. Writing about the day of his murder, she said: “Getting my purse out to buy two pork chops for tea was the last thing I did before my world imploded for ever. I went into the butcher’s holding my little boy’s hand, making one final stop before heading home. “I left without James’s hand in mine. It was one of those moments where the world feels like it is turning in slow motion. I remember a voice in my head. ‘Not James. Not my beautiful boy.’ This couldn’t be happening to me, I didn’t ever let him out of my sight.”  In February Denise led calls for a public inquiry into James’s death, and the decision to release Venables and Thompson from prison. But despite a 200,000-strong petition it was rejected by justice chiefs, who ruled an inquiry was not necessary. Venables and Thompson were released after serving eight years in youth prisons. Both were given new identities to protect them from reprisals. Robert Thompson has not reoffended since and is believed to have settled down to a normal life with a long-term partner. But Jon Venables has faced a number of further court cases since his conviction, using up almost \u0026pound260,000 in legal aid. He has been repeatedly sent back to prison over child porn. His \u0026pound259,585 legal aid covered judicial reviews, bids for new identities and an appeal against his sentence. Denise, 50, was eight months pregnant with son Michael, now 24, during the 1993 trial of Venables and Thompson. She went on to have Thomas, 19, and Leon, 18, with her second husband, electrician Stuart Fergus, 42. She had divorced from James’s dad Ralph Bulger in 1995. But Denise says she spent years fearing her boys would be snatched.

The young royals are keen to raise awareness of charities and other causes close to their hearts in Meghan’s home town, according to sources. The former Suits actress worked in a soup kitchen on the infamous Skid Row when she was just 13. Now she and husband Harry hope to bring attention to the plight of the homeless. They will also champion the LGBT community.  An LA source said: “Harry and Meghan are coming here for sure very soon. There is nothing announced yet but it will be in the near future. They plan to be very hands-on with their charitable work and mission to make life better for those less fortunate.” British Consul General Michael Howells, hosting a Royal Wedding Afternoon Tea with the British-American Business Council, said: “Obviously there’s Kensington Palace guidance. “But we asked ourselves what are the things about these two which we want to tell the world and it’s very clear – their charitable contribution is going to be a really huge part of their lives.  “They have an amazing convening power and obviously they use that for a range of enormously good causes around the world. People are just fascinated by them, so first and foremost it just reminds them what the UK is and who we are and the things that we are doing. “That very glaring spotlight, even in a very bright place like Hollywood, will cut through and give us an opportunity to explain what modern Britain looks like. Mr Howells said Los Angeles and America had been captivated by Meghan’s rise from Hollywood actress and activist to British royalty.

A Sunday Mirror probe found “once-opened” instructions are inconsistent and unclear as to whether they are recommendations on food safety or quality. So consumers end up confused as to how long they have to use a product, potentially encouraging them to bin things which are still perfectly edible. Now experts are calling on supermarkets and manufacturers to come up with a standard labelling system to reduce waste. One consumer champion even questioned if retailers were confusing shoppers deliberately to make them spend more.  In one extreme example, Patak’s mango chutney tells consumers it will last for six months after opening. Yet a virtually identical jar of Sainsbury’s own brand advises it must be used within four weeks. Hellmann’s mayonnaise gives a shelf life of three months once opened but Asda’s version allows only four weeks. Sainsbury’s salad cream tells consumers it must be used within four weeks, whereas the Asda version allows for eight.  Morrisons’ own brand red pesto says it will last only a week but Sainsbury’s own version gives consumers 14 days. A pack of chicken breasts from Iceland can be used within 24 hours of opening. But a Tesco pack advises immediate use. A pack of beef mince from Morrisons states it must be frozen on day of purchase and used within a month. But the label on a Sainsbury’s pack says it can be frozen any time within the use-by date and has a freezer life of three months. Households throw away 10.2million tons of food worth \u0026pound15billion a year. Of this, five million tons are still edible, according to figures from the official advisory group the Waste and Resources Action Programme. Last week Tesco ditched best-before dates on 70 packed fruit and vegetable lines in a bid to cut waste. Consumer activist Helen Dewdney, from the site The Complaining Cow, said: “Of course people will throw things away when past these dates, which increases food waste. One has to question why supermarkets are doing this? Is it to actually encourage people to buy more?” The British Retail Consortium said: “Retailers and food businesses work with suppliers to ensure the quality and safety of their products. Use-by dates vary as products, recipes and supply chains vary.” KETCHUP: Fridge Dipping chips in cold ketchup may not be to your taste, but scientists say keeping it in the cupboard has health risks.

Forecasters say the hot weather will make a return after the lightning, thunder, torrential downpours and flash floods that have blighted recent days. The mercury is expected to rise throughout week before peaking in the middle of the month. Some meteorologists say the blazing weather could even last well into July. Temperatures as high as the mid 20s will be common place, with even 30 degrees possible on the hottest days. One expert warned it could be muggy and humid on occasional cloudy days, but this will largely give way to extreme heat.  James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, told the Express : We expect it to turn increasingly warmer through the first week of the month with many parts of the country basking in temperatures in the mid 20Cs. “It could be rather muggy and humid with some variable cloud cover, but when the sun does come out it will feel extremely hot as summer gets underway.” WeatherAction forecaster Piers Corbyn added: From the second week of the month onwards when we expect to see a return to heatwave conditions, very hot weather is expected over Europe and some of that is going to influence the UK.  “We expect this to continue through to mid-month after which it will continue to be vary warm with another heatwave situation expected at some point. Yellow weather warnings for rain are currently in effect for large parts of Scotland, the East of England, North East, North West, Yorkshire and Humber and the West Midlands. But the warnings expire at 8am tomorrow and improvements are then expected.

That was a major factor in coming here,” is how the left-back put it.And he was convinced that will be the case after a chat with United assistant boss Laurie Ellis.The pair know each other, having been team-mates at Raith Rovers during the 2013-14 campaign.“I knew Laurie pretty well from my time at Raith. We got speaking about the prospect (of joining United). Since then it has gone pretty quickly.“Coming to a club like Dundee United is really a pretty simple choice.”Ironically, with new Morton boss Ray McKinnon considering a move for his old work-mate Ellis, it could be the pair don’t end up working together again next season.If United can persuade their highly regarded coach to stay, McKinnon could team up with another of his former Tannadice backroom staff, Darren Taylor.Returning to Booth, after a year spent vainly scrapping to avoid the drop, the ex-Hibs, Arbroath and Brechin man is looking forward to a challenge at the right end of a table.“Last season was tough and we just couldn’t get away from that drop zone,” he added.“This will be a different type of pressure, being expected to win most weeks and one which I will relish.”Booth will battle for the left-back slot with youngster Jamie Robson, who himself last week signed up for another two years at Tannadice.Manager Csaba Laszlo is pleased to have that kind of competition in the squad and to get a man of Booth’s quality and experience.“I’m delighted to bring Callum to Dundee United,” he said.“He is an experienced left-back who has played in the Premiership. Callum will create competition on the left side of our defence and improves the squad.

This should recognise that isolation can be caused or exacerbated by poverty and measures should be in place to support people on a low income to participate fully in society.“It would be helpful to equip staff, who engage with the public across a wide range of services, with the training and information to enable them to help identify people who may benefit from support.”The government will

I’m a great believer that if you’re good enough, you’re old enough.“I broke into the side at 17, 18. Back then it was almost sink or swim.“You have to have the right mentality and drive about you to survive in the first-team environment because I demand a lot from the boys.“The ones we accelerated into the first team first of all need to be thrown in to understand what it’s like to train at that level and what is expected to hit that first-team pitch.“I’ll find out very quickly if they can cope. Clearly there is a physical aspect and I need to know that should I need it or think he is ready ability-wise, is he physically ready?“There are boys there coming through our Development team and all have been told that in the upcoming season, you have to come in here in pre-season and tell me I am pushing.“There is no barrier. It’s not like ‘you’re only 16 or 17 and you’ve not really cracked it yet’, there’s nothing like that.“Come in for the four weeks of pre-season and blow the webs off it.”There might be no barrier but the level required from these young players and what the manager expects from every player, no matter the age, is extremely high.And it won’t take long for the youngsters to find that out.A prime example is 19-year-old Scott, a prolific goalscorer in the Development League, who featured for the Dark Blues in the final three matches of the last campaign.He came on against Partick Thistle in the last game of the season, replacing Craig Wighton after an hour, but failed to impress his manager.Neil said: “I’ll not tell you what I told Cedwyn after the Partick game but it was pretty stark.“If he is coming into my first team I expect him to score goals, create chances, to run after centre-backs, close down full-backs – he doesn’t get let off because he’s 18 years old.“He’s coming in during the summer and he’s got a short space of time to get in my face and say ‘I’m better than what you’re going to bring in. If you’ve not got anybody in yet, gaffer, I’m your man’.“All the boys that have made an impact in the first team have a real chance but they need to come back and be better than what I’ve got.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b111dfa0d8de.jpg ","title":"playpark becomes first in dundee to go smoke free","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA playpark in Stobswell has become the designated first smoke-free play area in the city.New signs designed by Glebelands Primary School pupil Weronika Soltys have been unveiled at the playground in Baxter Park.The signs will now be placed across parks throughout the city, restricting smokers from lighting up in play areas.Anne Rendall, neighbourhood services depute convener, said: “By introducing smoke-free playparks in Dundee, we are able to create children’s play areas that are cleaner as there is less chance of cigarette ends being discarded.“I believe these voluntary smoke-free zones will help improve people’s health across the city.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b10f80c669bf-e1527838783208.jpg ","title":"ralph signs but striker desired","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have added left-back Nathan Ralph as their fourth signing of the summer – but a striker is still top of boss Neil McCann’s wishlist.The 25-year-old moves to the Scottish Premiership from the English National League after suffering relegation with Woking last season.And the Tele revealed way back in January that a move for the former Yeovil Town man was likely in the summer.Gaffer Neil, however, is still working on bringing a goalscorer to the club.He’s made no secret of the fact his team were short in the scoring department last season and adding somebody to put the ball in the net would help him achieve the top-six finish he craves for his side.The club have already made a move for Macauley Bonne.The Leyton Orient striker knocked in an impressive 22 goals in the National League last season and has drawn plenty of interest from English league clubs.The Dark Blues tried to get in there early. However, they look to have been priced out of that deal.On Thursday the club did announce a capture in the shape of Ralph on a two-year deal.Moving up from the English non-league, he said: “I know the level is better than what I have been playing at recently so I’m looking to test myself as much as possible.“I feel like I’m good enough to play at this level. I’m excited, looking forward to it.”He also revealed he’d been persuaded to make the move north by new team-mate Roarie Deacon, with both players clients of OYS Sports Management along with Glen Kamara.Ralph added: “I’ve heard a lot of good things about the club.“I spoke to a few people as well, the likes of Roarie Deacon who said it’s a good place to come, play good football and the manager will improve me.“That’s pretty much everything I was looking for.“I am energetic, I like to attack.“I’m a left-back but I like to get forward as well.“I would say I’m decent in the air.“I like to try create when I can, I like getting assists.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1120f1b851a.jpg ","title":"revealed dundonians favourite summer holiday destinations","story":"\t\t\t\t\tJersey is proving a holiday hit with Dundonians this summer, a city travel agent has revealed.Colin Ramsay, owner of Ramsay World Travel, said that the Channel Island has been proving particularly popular with young people.He said: “We have seen lots of people going to Jersey – and more and more young people.“It is tremendous for young people because there is a great night life, relaxing beaches and bars.“You can also head out to France for a day trip when you are there.”Revealing this year’s holiday hotspots, Colin said that despite the city enjoying a warm spell, people are still booking deals for breaks in the sun – with Turkey being a favoured destination.He said: “We have seen a 62% increase in bookings for Turkey in the last three months.“There is more stability in the region at the moment and everything has calmed down.

It will also look at the introduction of some of its funniest and most famous characters – Dennis and Gnasher, Rodger the Dodger, Minnie the Minx and, of course, The Bash Street Kids.Mike Stirling, head of Beano Studios, said: “The exhibition is amazingly detailed.“It means that real hardcore fans of the Beano and Bash Street Kids are likely to come more than once.“To me, it’s like reading the Beano – you read it the first time then go back and see a wee joke here or there that you maybe missed.“Those wee nuggets will be picked up the more detailed your visit to The McManus is.“The exhibition includes things from the archive that haven’t been seen for years, from the very first issues of the comic right up to the CGI from the Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed series from CBBC – so it’s really unique.”The Bash Street Kids, Beanotown’s most rowdy pupils, have featured in the publication since the 1950s.Mike said: “The Bash Street Kids strip started out life as ‘When the Bell Rings’ in 1954, and that was because the editor at the time encouraged staff to look out the window when the bell was rung at the High School of Dundee for inspiration for the zany antics of the children in the playground.“What the kids were doing ended up in the strip quite regularly and helped the design of the characters.“In 1956 they became the Bash Street Kids and began to focus on the group of kids in Class 2B that we still see today.“Since 1961, David Sutherland has drawn the strip. He ‘retired’ in 1998 but continues to draw it. He’s one of the few artists who still hand in a hard copy of their work – a true legend.“You can imagine how much of his work is included in the exhibition. We will be showing a special movie in which he stars, showing the strip being put together.“I think The McManus is the only place in the world suitable for this because the cartoons are really Dundonian in nature.“Many a time there has been someone walking up Reform Street who has been the inspiration for a character or scene in the Beano, so The McManus really is the only place to showcase this.“For 80 years the Beano has been regularly enjoyed by 27 million people in the UK, so there will be things that appeal to grand-parents and grandchildren, their own memories of the comic over the years as it has evolved.”Meanwhile, illustrator Nigel Parkinson has created an original comic strip starring The Bash Street Kids designing the new sign for The McMenace.The illustration shows them tangled in the “Waldella, Dundee” by artist David Batchelor, which is one of museum’s most popular exhibits.The exhibition runs until Sunday October 21 and entry is free of charge.For further information, visit beano.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Brendan Rodgers  Celtic remain miles away from European elite","story":"                          BRENDAN RODGERS has admitted Celtic are still some distance away from properly competing in the Champions League."},{"url":null,"title":"Times Past gallery of the week  Glasgow theatres","story":"                          Evocative Images from the Archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"25 years of Real Love  The Time Frequency founder Jon Campbell reveals the key to the band s success","story":"                          IT\u0026rsquoS the early 90s and East End songwriter Jon Campbell is sitting in his Dennistoun flat compiling the words to Real Love."},{"url":null,"title":" Seeing Peru party has made me determined to help Scotland reach the World Cup ","story":"                          THEY came in their tens of thousands hours before kick-off all decked out in the iconic white and red strips of their country."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7151092.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Radical council plan to give residents control over budget spending","story":"                          Communities in Glasgow will get control of \u0026pound1m of council cash in a pilot scheme to give people more control over decisions."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7866672.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Can you help  Scotland  39 s top dance school needs a new home","story":"                          SCOTLAND\u0027S dance school is desperately seeking a new home with the closure of the Citizen\u0027s Theatre."},{"url":null,"title":"The bare chest is back  Aidan Turner shirtless again in new Poldark","story":"                          AIDAN Turner will cause a stir among viewers when he returns for another series of Poldark \u0026ndash without his shirt on."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7867533.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Lily Allen to bring UK tour to Glasgow -

The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential. With the future of the British High Street in decline at the moment, we need to look at as many options to make it viable for all business and attract new brands into the city centre.\"Saturday 2 Jun 2018 10:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04105000/04105690.jpg","title":"East of Inverness plans include bid for 3000 new homes","story":"\u0026nbspA VISION for 3000 new homes, three schools and a 30-acre district park for Inverness will be formally unveiled later this week \u0026ndash amid fierce opposition.While public feedback has included optimism about improved transport potential, fears have been raised that a fresh focus on the swathe of farmland between Barn Church Road and the Inverness College UHI could \"undermine investment confidence\" in the nearby Stratton new town project which is already under way.The Inverness East development brief prepared by Highland Council planners will be considered for adoption by city councillors on Thursday.The blueprint \u0026ndash which does not estimate the overall cost \u0026ndash aims to ensure expansion is \"co-ordinated, offering a clear vision and the right facilities to support new communities\".A draft version was approved for consultation last November. Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted. The Stratton development has been approved and is in accordance with the local development plan.\"Saturday 2 Jun 2018 10:43

there will be based at Holm Primary.Education Scotland sought assurances that they could be accommodated without negatively impacting on their learning.The council says additional classroom space will be provided as and when required, acknowledging that \"additional classroom space will put pressure on dining and play space within the school.\"It adds: \"A local stakeholder group will be formed, including parent and other representatives, and its remit will include transition arrangements as well as the development of the new school building.\"The council will look to discuss with the local stakeholders group how the accommodation pressures at Holm Primary can be managed.\"This would include consideration of additional hard play space.\"Following approval of the housing development for

However, after playing the first game I was hungry for more and I want to cement a place now.“I have had a taste of it and it is now up to me to keep improving, developing and giving the manager a decision to make.”Such was the faith McLeish had in the Pittodrie centre-back he was handed a start on his debut in the 1-0 friendly loss to Costa Rica in March.McKenna impressed so much he retained that spot for the 1-0 defeat of Hungary in Budapest a few days later. The young Don produced a man of the match performance.Although still a relative Scotland rookie, McKenna was the second most experienced international in a starting defence in the 2-0 loss in Peru which included debut caps Jordan Archer, Stephen O’Donnell and Lewis Stevenson.Only captain Charlie Mulgrew, winning his 35th cap, had more experience.For McKenna, working under Pittodrie defensive legend McLeish has been invaluable in his career development.The Gothenburg Great’s advice? Play for Scotland the way he does for Aberdeen.McKenna said: “He (McLeish) has been brilliant for me, especially in training.“In the first camp he was giving me wee bits of advice and in this camp he showed me a video clip from it.“It wasn’t a mistake or anything, it was simply a back pass. He asked me why I did it and I said it had been my first game and I was being safe.“He said, ‘don’t be, do what you do at your club’ and has been telling me to be positive. He has that belief in me which is encouraging.”Aberdeen skipper Graeme Shinnie is set to earn his second cap in Mexico City having made his debut as a substitute against Peru.Scotland jetted out to Mexico last night as they had opted to remain in Lima, Peru, to train as the conditions were more favourable there.The temperature is set to be in the high 20s at the Azteca with the added difficulty of altitude at 7,200 feet above sea level.Both Mexico and Peru are using the Scots as part of their World Cup preparations.Yet again Scotland have failed to qualify. It is now two decades since the Scots last graced the finals of a major tournament, at the World Cup in France in 1998.McKenna is desperate for that barren run to end.He said: “We have to get Scotland to that place where everyone is at Hampden having a party before we go off to a major tournament.“It is something we want to do. The sheer love of football out in Peru is incredible“You could see how much it means to them to be going to the World Cup.“We went out to the coffee shops across from the hotel earlier in the week and were mobbed for photos.“People were stopping their cars to take photos of the bus on the way to training, it was incredible. The atmosphere was like that the whole week.”Along with Aberdeen skipper Shinnie, 26, another six players made their debuts against Peru – Archer, O’Donnell, Stevenson, Dylan McGeouch, Lewis Morgan and Chris Cadden.McKenna conceded a penalty in the 36th minute in Lima when he blocked a Jefferson Farfan shot following a mistake from keeper Archer.There was no culpability in the incident with McKenna who at least denied Farfan a certain goal.The resultant spot-kick was converted by Christian Cueva, with Farfan scoring the second early in the second-half in front of a sell-out crowd of 47,000.McKenna and Shinnie are set to grace the stadium that hosted the 1970 World Cup final where Brazil defeated Italy 4-1. It is also the venue where Diego Maradona scored a sublime solo goal in the 1986 World Cup quarter-final win over England.McKenna said: “The atmosphere was incredible and the Azteca is double the capacity from the Estadio Nacional.“It is their last game before they go to the World Cup so it will be even better. It is something all the boys have to look forward to and enjoy.“A positive result would be good but as it is a young squad it is important that we put on a good performance.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/IMG_2084-e1527853798398-780x564.jpg ","title":"beer of the week stone ipa","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStone Brewing, headquartered in California but brewing in Berlin, pops up regularly when chatting to bar staff about good beers.When I spotted their IPA on the shelf at Tesco (I had popped in for milk, honest) I thought I\u0026#8217d give this West Coast IPA a go.It fills the glass with a lovely antique gold, crystal-clear beer, topped with a pleasing white head.The nose is subtle, citrus lemon and a hint of Weetabix about it.It has great body and mouth feel with a juicy attack and those citrus notes are nicely sharp, then it\u0026#8217s washed away almost immediately with a huge hoppiness.

Bubbles delight children of all ages and show a whole spectrum of colours.“We hope that in celebrating the many positive aspects of autism we can show that autism and autistic people have a lot to offer – there is joy to be had in being autistic.“Our different way of thinking and experiencing the world is something to take pride in.“There is a lot of public awareness about autism, and we’d now like to raise public understanding, acceptance and appreciation of the condition.Marion is also looking to hand out leaflets with other people taking part in the event, called “The Awesomeness of Autism.”The leaflet will include quotes from people about why they like being autistic, to help promote positivity.Marion added: “Autism comes with strengths, and Autistic Pride Day is a great time to celebrate those.”Anyone who is interested in submitting quotes to be included in the leaflet is encouraged to do so, and is asked to email them to the group by the end of today.For more information, email autisticpride aberdeen@gmail or visit their Facebook page.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"business brings together volunteers for litter pick","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMore than 50 bags of rubbish were collected after Aberdeen residents teamed up with a local authority to clean up an award-winning park.Pupils from St Machar Academy, Seaton Park’s Volunteer Group, McDonald’s workers and Keep Scotland Beautiful came together to remove rubbish and unsightly debris from Seaton Park where more than 50 bags were rounded up.The team of 42 got together ahead of the green space’s upcoming Green Flag inspection, which is taking place this week, and sanded down park benches and weeded the garden.Keep Scotland Beautiful operation director Carole Noble said: “I am delighted that McDonald’s has agreed to support Clean Up Scotland’s campaign with such a huge event.“As a brand McDonald’s has been active in championing litter prevention activity for many years.“The support from McDonald’s crew members and customers will be invaluable in helping raise awareness of the litter that surrounds us.”The restaurant franchise has supported Keep Scotland Beautiful’s Clean Up Scotland litter campaign since 2007.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/5b1270b3558e8-120x180.jpg ","title":"charity walk on course for fun","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMore than 2,200 people are set to turn the Granite City tartan this weekend for Aberdeen’s biggest ever Kiltwalk.Following the huge success of this year’s first event in Glasgow, Aberdeen walkers will raise money for charities across the city and Aberdeenshire including Alfie’s Trust, Mental Health Aberdeen and Team Jak.The Kiltwalk – which will take place on the old Deeside Railway tomorrow – has a unique fundraising model because all funds raised by the walkers will be given a 40% top up by Sir Tom Hunter and The Hunter Foundation.The entrepreneur said: “When President Obama came to Scotland last year for The Hunter Foundation, we decided to distribute the proceeds from the dinner through Kiltwalk.“The model is simple – you walk for your chosen charity and we add 40% so that your chosen charity will receive £1.40 for every £1 raised.“It enabled our foundation to increase its reach to hundreds and now over a thousand charities, supporting them in what they care about.“Last year our 14,000 walkers raised £1.92 million for 780 charities and we added £757,000 taking the grand total to £2,678,529.”Sir Tom also reminded generous north-east people that it’s not too late to register and take part in this weekend’s festivities.He said: “There’s still time to sign-up. Why not come along and do the five mile Wee Wander on Sunday and take part in Kiltwalk?“I’m sure participants will come back next year and raise even more money for the causes people care about.“We will have around 2,200 walkers and we reckon they will raise £250,000 and it will be my privilege to add £100,000 for charities here in the north-east.”The philanthropist, who made his billions in property and sports goods, explained that it was the participants who make the charity walk so special.He said: “I always ask people taking part who they are walking for and why and their stories really inspire me.“It’s incredibly moving to hear why they’re doing Kiltwalk. And what I’ve discovered is that every single walker has their own story and they are all compelling and sometimes heartbreaking – it shows Scotland has heart.”Walkers will be taking on three different distances, the 5-mile Wee Wander, 14-mile Big Stroll or the Mighty Stride which involves a marathon-length distance of 26 miles.The new route of the Wee Wander will now see participants set off from Camphill Rudolph Steiner School in Bieldside, following the River Dee before ending up at the Kiltwalk Village at Duthie Park.Those hardy walkers taking on the Mighty Stride will begin their journey at Potarch Green, while Big Strollers will begin at Milton Park in Crathes.On finishing, participants will be able to enjoy entertainment in the Kiltwalk Village from the Aberdeen Jazz Orchestra, as well as a hot meal.There will also be the chance for one lucky fundraiser to win a new Vauxhall Corsa 1.4 SRi, donated by Arnold Clark.It’s not too late to register to take part in this year’s Kiltwalk.The Mighty Stride suits the energetic and active, covering a marathon 26 miles starting from Potarch at 9am.Those hoping for something a touch less strenuous can take on The Big Stroll which sets off at 11am with registration from 10am.Entry for adults and children is £31.65.The Wee Wander route is much more achievable at just under five miles. Entry for adults costs £12.66, £6.33 for children and the course is free for children aged under five.To register visit thekiltwalk/events/aberdeen-2018\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"drink fuelled driver struck barrier and oncoming car","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA drink-driver smashed into a roundabout and a car while she was more than three times the limit.Susan Bain or Craig, 51, appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court where she pled guilty to a charge of dangerous driving and of driving with 177 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.The legal limit is 50 milligram of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.The offences happened on January 8 on the A96 between the Oyne Fork, Inverurie, and Blackburn.The charge states Craig drove dangerously while intoxicated and collided with an oncoming vehicle, causing damage to it.It also states she failed to keep a proper lookout, struck a roundabout, lost control of her vehicle, caused it to travel backwards and struck a crash barrier.According to the document, the incident caused “extensive damage” to the vehicle and injury to Craig.Representing Craig, defence agent Ian Woodward-Nutt said the behaviour was “out of character” and asked for sentence to be deferred for reports.He added: “There’s no medical issues, but there is certainly a background issue which caused great difficulties to my client and formed the background to this out-of-character behaviour.”Fiscal depute Lixia Sun told the court Craig had no previous convictions.Sheriff Gary Aitken told Craig, whose address was given in court papers as Jesmond Circle, Bridge of Don, Aberdeen: “I’m going to defer sentence on you for the preparation of a criminal justice social work report.“It gives the court much more information and a clearer picture of how best to deal with what are significant offences.”Sheriff Aitken also disqualified her from driving in the interim period.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here. I mean, you couldn\u0026#8217t keep up that slightly rustic look. It\u0026#8217s a cracking place now. Just superb.\u0026#8217Johnny Noble sadly died in 2002, aged just 66.\u0026#8216He was an inspiring, lovely man, said Mr Lane. \u0026#8216No matter what disaster befell us no matter what cock-up happened, he was ever-optimistic and just kept us going.\u0026#8216We would have our business meetings in the billiard room at [Johnny\u0026#8217s home] Ardkinglas House, and there would be a bottle of something. That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in. Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them. In the end he\u0026#8217d sit down with them and you\u0026#8217d never see him again for the rest of the evening.\u0026#8216I don\u0026#8217t think we realised just how important he was for the business until he was gone.\u0026#8217Now living a quieter life in Cornwall with his Dexters, Mr Lane concluded: \u0026#8216My wife and I changed tack in life, really, and it keeps us busy.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

Was that a bird\u0026#8230or something else? Just what might we find beyond the paths?The reserve’s new art trail, though, dials up the magic a notch.Just by the entrance, Jane Walker’s straw deer of willow and scraps greet the viewer. Entitled ‘Looking for Noah’ they stand, incongruously with a licence plate wedged in antlers.The walk takes the visitor past thought-provoking sculptures, including Lesley Burr’s beautifully-painted birdcages that could house fairies, to an opening at The Mill with its own maze and poetry carved into rock.The Artmap Argyll group brings together artists of different specialities to make for an intrigung walk through the woods.A highlight for many will be Melanie Chimelewska’s limestone seal pup, lying gleefully on the shore, but Andy McClintock’s dancing mermaids undoubtedly captured a feeling of eerie magic, as though having stepped into a Grimm brothers\u0026#8217 fairytale. The wire and cloth faceless mermaids dance on the surface of a pond but hide, too, under a running waterfall, washing the seaweed stuck to their scaled tails.Andy McClintock said: ‘I imagine water sprites dancing in the lagoon and disporting themselves in waterfalls.’Within The Mill itself, paintings are hung showing the allure of algae.Artist Lottie Goodlet said: ‘As a snorkeller and swimmer in the Sound of Jura, I am fascinated by seaweed beneath me. I see it as secret and unexpected treasure \u0026#8211 underwater kelp forests and ocean meadows gracefully riding the ebb and flow of the tides.’The influences of nature brought into a new light makes for a mysterious experience that will stay with you far longer than the trail can last.The art trail at Taynish National Nature Reserve runs until Sunday September 30.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 21","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/05/18, 5:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Many thanks to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead kids get kitted out","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/05/18, 5:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Soccer Centre is delighted to have taken delivery of a quality rain jacket for each of the kids associated with the centre and Red Star YFC.That’s 120 rain jackets in total.As well as making sure the kids look smart and feel part of the club they will also help keep them dry and warm when the weather is a bit wet and windy.The rain jackets have been sponsored by Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) and the Soccer Centre would like to say a huge thank you to MAYDS for this sponsorship and ongoing support.Five teams from Lochgilphead travelled to the Oban Football Festival on a Saturday April 28.

Elsewhere in the sheep classes, the Suffolks have their highest number in 10 years with 110 entries (90 in 2017). The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017). Commercial sheep entries are also seeing increased interest with 104 entries, up from 85 in 2017.  The North of England Mule class was introduced to the Show in 2011 and sees its highest ever entries, with 69 in the class.The Young Handler competition has 56 entries, illustrating the continued interest from the next generation particularly in this the Year of Young People.An exciting development is the interest in the goat classes with a ten-year high of 39 entries and the Boer breed, increasing from 16 to 27.  Six goat young handlers will also compete for the title.1,665 entries have been received in the light horse section, with the HOYS qualifying Mountain and Moorland Under Saddle section again dominating with 197 entries, up from 192 in 2017.The Heavy Horse section continues to have a strong presence, with 392 entries.

He said: “I don’t know what the future holds yet, mainly because we didn’t know what league we were going to be in. “We haven’t even spoke about it yet — we are still focused on the celebrations, to be honest.”  “The fans have been incredible all season and have always turned out in big numbers. “Especially away to Alloa, the turnout was just amazing. “The support have been amazing with me and have taken a real shine to me. “I have played well for Ayr and the fans have obviously recognised that, and it’s good to play for those fans. “This is my highest scoring season, but I was gutted not to get 30. “Although if I had a chance to get 30 it would have been in the play-offs, so I was happy to stay at 29.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ayr uniteds ian mccall lawrence","story":"NewsAyr United\u0027s Ian McCall and Lawrence Shankland bag Ladbrokes awardsIt comes after Ayr United won the League One title, with an impressive 124 goals in all competitions.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet15:23, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland win the Ladbrokes League 1 Manager and Player of the Year awards (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland have bagged an awards double.

Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.  Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie. And the groomsmen wore Arran Mist tartan kilts with charcoal jackets and gold ties - exclusive to MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise! Our villa was right on the beach so it was perfect for watching the sunset.  Thistle \u0026amp Blink Photography from Kilmarnock captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to relive. Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie. Erin added: “We would like to say a huge thank you to our families, bridesmaids and groomsmen for their help in the planning and execution of our dream wedding- it couldn’t have gone better! “Thank you to everyone who shared in our special day, your generosity and well wishes have been overwhelming.

Community leaders in Stranraer, desperate to lick their own sand back in shape, want to use the South Ayrshire model of success. It follows Prestwick’s hard fought battle to convince council bosses to clean up their rubble-strewn shore. Norrie Smith, vice chair of Prestwick South Community Council, performed the role of special envoy on a trip down the coast. He said: “The guys down there were very keen to talk to us about how we went about things. “Their problem is slightly different in terms of what they need to clean up, but the premise is the same. “They’ve got a fantastic community asset, much like ours, and it’s just about returning it to its rightful state and making the most of it.”  While weeds and silt are dogging Stranraer’s shoreline, Prestwick is facing the ongoing battle of mounting rubble. Already, more than 500 tonnes has been removed from the beach since council diggers were sent in to level the sand. Norrie added: “We’re delighted that our example has been recognised elsewhere. “People in this town campaigned long and hard to get where we are now, and if we can help others by sharing best practice then great. “I’m all for collaboration, whether it’s in your own town or further afield, so linking up like this can only be a positive thing.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"win a summer shopping spree","story":"NewsWin a summer shopping spreeTo help you get fashion and beauty- ready for summer, Debenhams at Ayr Central are hosting a fabulous VIP shopping event on Thursday June 7.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post10:35, 30 MAY 2018Updated10:36, 30 MAY 2018NewsGet ready for summer and be in with a chance of winning a shopping spree\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWIN A SUMMER SHOPPING SPREE!

Wren Kitchens will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal. The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.
