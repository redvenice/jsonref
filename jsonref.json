The vast majority of people live in rural areas, where the expansion of settlements and agriculture is slowly thinning the forest edge by cattle and plough. Preserved as an act of faith for centuries, these forests are proof of the power of spiritual ideas to create sustainable landscapes. Seen from above, the forests are demarcated by the stark boundary between sacred and secular, church and field, work and rest. They are places detached from everyday life yet central to it, informing human work and relationships within society. Like other objects within Orthodox traditions, the forests direct the worshipper to look beyond what is visible. Entering them, the arid silence of subsistence farmland gives way to the forest’s cool, fragrant air, filled with a cacophony of living song. The sounds of insects, birds and monkeys rise with human voices into the canopy and up to the heavens. Generations come and go under the same ancient trees as their ancestors. The symbol of the tree is at the heart of the Christian story, from the tree of life standing in the Garden of Eden in Genesis to its redemptive role in Revelation, bridging the river of life and bearing fruit for the healing of nations. The story of Eden has been shared in Ethiopia for millennia – well before the Aksumite kingdom adopted Christianity around 325AD, and even before a tree came to symbolise the global faith. Today, in Ethiopia, each church forest is seen by its s as a miniature Garden of Eden. The religious significance of the forest is equalled by the importance of its ecological function. These sacred oases raise water tables, lower temperatures, block destructive winds and are home to yield-boosting pollinators essential to surrounding agriculture. The forests are, therefore, genetic repositories vital for the future survival of human life in Ethiopia. Priests who do not protect these natural resources are deemed to have failed in their mission, and since understanding the global importance of the forests they care for, the priests have become even more committed to the cause. The vast church forest network, covering an area the size of England and Wales, has the potential to offer a significant barrier to desertification in this region. For now the task is to strengthen what remains by the simplest solution possible: building conservation walls around the forests that keep grazing cattle out and allow vegetation to regrow. Only 20 churches, all supported by church forest experts Dr Meg Lowman and Dr Alemayehu Wassie Eshete, have walls, and only a few hundred out of the many thousands are viable habitats. All need protecting. Yet, as unique as they are, these forest churches are not merely a localised cultural novelty: Ethiopia’s grassroots and spiritually motivated conservation efforts sit within a global context of efforts to resolve our ecological crises. In the secular west, we can easily overlook spiritual viewpoints as we seek ways to restore and protect the environment, despite the roots of the modern environmental movement being spiritual. As these photographs show, spiritual beliefs still have the power to conserve and heal.

Both airlines have reported huge losses and laid off thousands of staff during 20 months of restricted travel.

He also said the NHS was in a “serious situation” and that Covid “is not over”. “There’s an awful lot of Covid still around,” he said. “At the moment we’re seeing admission rates running at something like 1,000 people per day and there’s currently over 1,000 people on mechanical ventilators in our hospitals. “And I just don’t think people realise the serious situation that there is out there in the National Health Service hospitals, with so many people on ventilators and over 9,000 people actually in the hospital currently with Covid-19. Covid isn’t done. It’s not over.”Asked about the prospect of a winter lockdown, PA Media quotes him telling Sky News:  Asked about the future of booster jabs, he said “I remember having these sorts of discussions about nine months ago when the vaccinations were starting to roll out, that it’s possible that this virus could become endemic, so circulate in the population every year in the way that flu does. “It’s possible that every year … we’re having to go out and get our Covid jabs in the same way a lot of people are currently getting their flu jabs.” Dr Tildesley said the booster programme was “going in the right direction but there clearly is work to do for the people over 50, for vulnerable adults”. He added: “Immunity will be starting to wane from the second jab so it is really important that that acceleration continues and hopefully we get as many people protected as possible as we move into the colder months.”Writing in the Daily , Hancock, who resigned as health secretary in June after it emerged he had breached Covid-19 social distancing restrictions with Gina Coladangelo, an adviser with whom he was having an affair, warned ministers against delaying mandatory jabs for nurses and doctors. Hancock’s comments come as the chief executive of NHS England said the country faced “a difficult winter”, with hospital Covid admissions 14 times higher than they were this time last year. It has been reported that the government is expected to say the law will not be changed to require Covid jabs for the NHS’s 1.45 million staff in England until spring 2022. The law has already been changed to make Covid jabs mandatory for care workers in England, with the requirement to come into effect on Thursday.

Differing rules over coronavirus vaccines threaten to hold up family reunions. Some inoculated Mexicans will not be able to enter the US immediately if they received vaccines in Mexico that have not been approved by the World Health Organization such as China’s CanSino and Russia’s Sputnik V. “I never imagined that because I got the CanSino vaccine I wouldn’t be able to cross,” lamented Donato Suarez, a driver at a private university in Tijuana who had hoped to visit relatives in the United States he has not seen for nearly two years. “We even had plans to do something when the border reopened,” he added, noting around 300 people where he works are in the same predicament. “We’ll have to wait.” The Doherty Institute has released modelling which examines what would happen to infection numbers in a school outbreak under various scenarios. It finds that incursions into schools would be “inevitable” during rising cases of community transmission, and notes that returning students to in-person learning and keeping schools open safely has been identified as a national priority. The findings, provided to national cabinet on Friday, recommend surveillance testing to allow for early detection of positive Covid cases in schools, which would reduce the likelihood of an outbreak, and suggests that in the event of a positive case, close contacts should not have to quarantine. “We compared a seven-day quarantine of classroom contacts to a strategy called a ‘test to stay’ … where for seven days, if there’s a case in a school, their classroom contacts need to have a daily rapid antigen test before attending school, and they can continue attending school provided they keep testing negative,” Dr Nick Scott, who oversaw the schools modelling for the Doherty Institute, said on Monday.

Access to indoor dining and other indoor events will be limited to those who are fully vaccinated or can show proof of recovery. The new rules are the toughest state-wide restrictions in Germany against non-inoculated people. Only children as well as those who cannot receive jabs for medical reasons will be exempt.“Issues of injustice or ethics are so high in the world, because some countries haven’t gotten a lot of first shots,” he said.

"},{"url":null,"title":"and the worst company in ireland for customer experience in 2021 is","story":"Entertainment, delivery and telecoms companies are among the worst performers in the CXi report. Photograph: iStockIt’s hard to know if the companies that sit on this page’s bold step each week aren’t listening to what people say about them or just don’t give a rashers but one depressing thing a recent customer service report card makes clear is: it is worse they are getting and not better.The CXi Report has been released by the CX Company every autumn since 2015 and by its reckoning, the level of customer experience people get from the top 150 or so companies doing business in Ireland has declined by 10 per cent over the last six years.While many companies’ customer experience (CX) scores benefitted from something of a Covid bounce last year, as they worked harder to make things better in terrible times, the pandemic has dragged on and this year it is more a case of a Covid hangover.The overall CX score fell 4.4 per cent compared with the 2020 figure, making it the biggest year-on-year decline recorded since the survey began. It also means Ireland’s CX score is now at a seven-year low, having recorded a cumulative fall of 10.8 per cent since 2015. And it’s not like things were any good in 2015.Pharmacies and coffee companies have had a strong performance through Covid and make up seven of the top 10 companies, while supermarkets have also done well.However, the entertainment, delivery and telecoms sectors are among the worst performers in the survey, which was carried out by Amárach Research on behalf of the CX Company and based on a cross-section of Irish consumers who were asked for feedback on their experiences with 151 companies across 11 sectors.The identity of the company that featured on the bottom of the pile this year will not come as a surprise to many readers of this page, and the firms who finished just ahead of them won’t exactly shock people out of their socks either.Drum roll please. The worst company for customer experience in Ireland in 2021 was . . . Eir. It replaced Ryanair at the bottom of the heap, although there is no reason for Ryanair to get out the bunting, as it finished third-last just ahead of Facebook which was ranked as the second-worst company in Ireland.All told, almost one in two – or 44 per cent – of Eir’s customers said the company had failed to meet their expectations over the last year, while 25 per cent said the same about Ryanair.The Department of Social Protection and Irish Water were both on 24 per cent, while Sky also fared badly with 23 per cent of its customers saying it had failed to meet their expectations.The Passport Service, the National Lottery, Adverts.ie and Abrakebabra were among the other companies who did badly in their customers’ eyes, recording big falls in the annual chart.At the other end of the table, the credit unions finished on top of the pile for the seventh year in a row, making it the only brand to have maintained a constant presence in the top 10 since the survey began.Customer service proved to be no game for Smyths Toys which moved up 30 places to claim second, thanks – at least in part – to what CX Ireland describes as a “highly efficient pick, pack and ship operation which they created in record time”.Hickeys, McCabes, Lloyds, McCauleys and Boots all made the top 10, proof of the important role pharmacies played in keeping customers well – especially vulnerable patients – and in helping to battle the virus through the vaccination programme.Supermarkets continue to perform well – this year they are represented in the top 10 by Aldi, which replaced Lidl – indicating the important role they have played in the past year.Some of the biggest jumpers in the 2021 league table included Energia, Lifestyle Sports, Free Now and An Post Money.Two of the new entrants are coffee companies, Nespresso and Butlers Chocolates, who both devised novel ways of serving customers who still wanted to treat themselves.The chairman of The CX Company, Michael Killeen, described Eir’s treatment of its customers as appalling. “The telecom sector has been one of the poorest performers in our survey over the last seven years,” he says. “While Eir is the standout offender and seems more focused on making money for its owners rather than doing what’s right for their customers, its competitors Sky and Virgin would also recognise more work needs to be done to deliver greater customer experiences.”He noted that “entertainment and travel obviously faced huge challenges this year and this goes a long way to explaining their poor performance”.He added: “Logistics and delivery is a new sector this year and one where companies are struggling to keep up with increased demand. The other key issue for companies such as Fastway, UPS, Parcel Motel, DHL and An Post is managing the resolution of issues when they arise.“The financial sector hasn’t had a great Covid and its response to the current high levels of attempted fraud has been underwhelming to say the least. The public sector is another which could do better – the Department of Social Protection and even the HSE failing to meet customer expectations.”Post-Covid: ‘Goodwill is fading fast and customers have a lot less tolerance’ Cathy Summers of CX Ireland is the author of the report and she described, with a degree of understatement, the low score as “a concern”.She accepted that since early 2020 companies had been battling the effects of Covid, but said they now needed to “refocus their efforts on enhancing the customer journey and overall experience”.Summers suggested: “Post-Covid indecision and fatigue appear to be taking a toll on companies and their approach to CX. As a result, customers are losing out. Whereas these very customers were quite forgiving during Covid as organisations struggled to adapt to new processes and procedures, that goodwill is fading fast and customers have a lot less tolerance now. Especially if there are long delays answering or communicating with the organisation.”She added: “During Covid many companies invested in digital solutions to interact with customers as a necessity due to lockdowns. While these can work well and yield savings, sometimes, they can be more focused on the short-term needs of the company rather than the needs of the customer. In our report, we are seeing a real hunger from customers to get back to personal one-on-one interactions. They want empathy and reassurance sometimes they just want to talk to a fellow human being.”How the rankings work Summers also explained how the rankings work. People who take part are asked to rank the companies they have had dealings with out of 10, with any score over eight deemed to be an excellent customer service experience.In 2015 the average across all the companies assessed was 7.06, while this year it stands at 6.32. There are very few brands who got more than eight.She said the top ranking of the credit unions was a “phenomenal achievement”, even though their score did fall slightly this year when compared with 2020. They were still significantly ahead of the chasing pack and pointed to “a gap of 75 per cent between their score and the bottom brand score”.She said Smyths employees “went out of their way to help customers”, and suggested that often it was the little things staff did that made all the difference. “It might be a small thing but it made a big difference, and those experiences are driven by people, humans. I think one of the overall themes of this year’s report was that digital is important and customers want to do things digitally but, you know, they’re very much a transaction. There’s no emotional connection there – and that’s what you need to create that experience.”Summers said: “Doing the right thing is what customer experience is all about. It is about being able to empower employees to make those decisions to pick up the phone and ask somebody if they’re actually having problems, to take that common sense approach, you know, like imagining if it was your brother, mother, granny or whoever, what would you do to help them out?”She said too many companies trained their frontline employees “on processes and systems, and they don’t actually remember that their employees are people as well and there’s a really strong link between employee experience and customer experience – because if your employees aren’t having a good experience, you can’t expect them to give one to customers. A lot of it for me comes down to how much the employers trust the employees to actually, you know, do the right thing, use their common sense. And obviously, yes, they need support in terms of education, training, but being able to be empowered to do the right thing. And also know that if they do make a mistake, you know, it’s not the end of the world.”She pointed out that last year was a bad year for the Passport Service and the National Lottery. “It’s an interesting one,” she said, “because we also measure where companies have exceeded or failed to meet customer expectations, and the passport service actually score really highly on both counts. And I think, you know, they do a fantastic job but I think they struggled because of not being able to have the office open to provide that backup for people, particularly where they had emergencies.”And were people disappointed by the National Lottery because they didn’t win the Lotto? Or was that just Pricewatch? “Maybe it was because a lot of people couldn’t get in to actually play it in physical stores so they had to go online and that caused a challenge for them. I think that probably had quite a lot to do with it.”It should be noted that the Lotto app is very easy to use once you are set up and get the hang of it, so were people getting frustrated because they were struggling with the unfamiliar and then blaming the company? “Yes, absolutely,” she said. “Having to do things online if you’re not used to it or you’ve got a certain way that you like to do things and you have to change your behaviours and your habits and you feel like you’re being forced to do that, you know, can have a negative impact on how people view their experience – because customers do want to do certain things in certain ways with certain companies.”She said Ryanair improved its scores in 2021 compared with a terrible 2020 when it clocked up the lowest score in the history of the survey last year.“I think for some industries, particularly like travel, also the telecom sector, they had real struggles. It’s about equating the importance that some of these companies play in our lives. So, being able to travel obviously was a key one. We were restricted. But how that was handled, when it was opened up, was key.”When it comes to the telecoms companies, Summers said: “We are so dependent on being connected. And if we aren’t connected or there’s a problem, it’s a major, major issue. You go to the supermarket and you can’t get any milk – it’s not a big deal. You can just go somewhere else.”And how does a company address bad ratings? “It’s really being able to understand where the pain points are for customers. So what are the things that are causing the most frustrations, the most issues? So looking at each transaction or interaction that a customer has and where are the pain points for them?“I think a lot of companies have gone down the digital route and sometimes the technology isn’t fit for purpose. And they’ve done it to save money – so they’ve done it for their own needs, rather than the customer needs. And then what can happen is that the customers can’t use the technology or have queries and that generates more calls into the company as well.“And it’s really about being able to understand their customers. Think about them as human beings, understand what they need and be able to invest in improving the customer experience rather than just trying to save money.”"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Of some 240 known wetland species, almost 70 have been listed for Red List protectionStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"contracts of covid 19 contact tracers extended for six months","story":"The resurgence of Covid-19 has forced the HSE to reverse direction just six weeks after the National Public Health Emergency Team  was considering proposals to wind down routine contact tracing from the end of October. Photograph: Getty The contracts of hundreds of contact tracers who track Covid-19 infections are being extended to next April, in a sign of the increasing unpredictability of the coronavirus pandemic’s trajectory.Private recruitment business CPL, which the Health Service Executive (HSE) uses to employ contact tracers, told the Covid-19 tracing teams they will be required for another six months after an “extremely busy” six-week period of “significant and sustained increases in case numbers”.The company informed contact tracers late last week that the HSE needs to maintain its existing contact tracing capability well into 2022 so it can “deal with issues, both predicted and unforeseen” over the next three to six months. About 900 people currently work in contact tracing.Contracts are being extended to April 30th. Staff were told they may asked to support public health teams on complex contact tracing investigations and, if contact tracing activity declines over the six months, to carry out “other suitable duties for a temporary period”.The resurgence of Covid-19, with cases rising above 3,000 new infections a day in a fourth wave, has forced the HSE to reverse direction just six weeks after the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) was considering proposals to wind down routine contact tracing from the end of October.‘At full stretch’The Department of Health reported a further 3,428 Covid-19 cases on Sunday, putting the seven-day average – a measure that evens out daily fluctuations – at 3,399, up 51 per cent in a week.The HSE said last week its test-and-trace system was operating “at full stretch” and that if cases continued to rise through the winter it would “present a challenge”.In further measures to tackle the spread of the virus, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said he expected rapid antigen testing to be used in primary schools before Christmas.He said he would like to see “urgent and rapid sanctions” for outlets in the hospitality sector which were not checking Covid-19 vaccine certificates.There is a growing ide emerging between the Government and public health advisers on whether to extend vaccine boosters to the wider population as a way of suppressing the virus.Booster effectivenessA Government insider pointed to overwhelming international evidence showing the effectiveness of booster doses in countries such as Israel, both to protect people from disease due to waning immunity from the initial jabs and to prevent transmission.Nphet has questioned whether it is appropriate to “re-medicate” the entire population with a booster dose as a substitute for basic public health measures to prevent the spread of the virus, but has left the matter open to the Government, saying it was a “very big policy decision”.The public health team sees booster doses, currently being administered to people aged 60 and over and those with weakened immune systems, as a means to protect against severe disease, believing there is no one “magic solution” to prevent the virus spreading.While figures in the Government acknowledge the National Immunisation Advisory Committee’s responsibilities to consider the effect of a wider booster programme, they believe there is a compelling argument for third doses for younger age groups to reduce disease and transmission.“The trajectory seems to be boosters for younger age groups. It is almost inevitable that they will include younger age groups. It is just a question of when,” said one Government source.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"supplier at centre of mica storm describes devastating effect on his family","story":"Protesters outside the Donegal County Council offices in Letterkenny last May.

Photograph: Jim Lo ScalzoEPAIn Shakespeare, when characters want to fulfil their desires, they escape to what’s been called the Green World. And that’s what Democrats promised voters: that they could leave behind the vitriol and aggravation of Donald Trump’s America and escape to an Arden that was cool, calm and reassuring.Democrats violated that pledge. On the way to that verdant forest, we got led into a circular firing squad. Tight margins in Congress do not bring out the best in pols.“We promised to change the rancour and ision,” said one top Democrat. “So we offered something else: ision and rancour.”Many who were sick of Trump chaos and ineptitude are now sick of Biden chaos and ineptitude. Scranton Joe was supposed to be the sensible, steady one. After all, as Democrats are keenly aware, Trump lost the 2020 race as much as Biden won it. Only 44,000 votes in Arizona, Wisconsin and Georgia saved Biden from an Electoral College tie.And for a long time now, people have been watching the spectacle of Democrats grinding away at the sausage and fighting for their piece of the pie (to make a metaphoric meal). And it has not been a pretty picture.There’s some truth in what James Carville told Judy Woodruff: “What went wrong is this stupid wokeness. Don’t just look at Virginia and New Jersey. Look at Long Island, look at Buffalo, look at Minneapolis, even look at Seattle, Wash. I mean, this defund the police lunacy, this take Abraham Lincoln’s name off of schools.”There’s also some truth in what representative Abigail Spanberger, a moderate in a tough re-election battle, told the New York Times’s Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns about the president: “Nobody elected him to be FDR they elected him to be normal and stop the chaos.”Biden has pursued his two bills with Captain Ahab-like zeal he pines to be FDR and eclipse Barack Obama, who pushed him aside for Hillary Clinton. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi hail the bills as transformational. But what are you transforming into?The election cratering showed that such overweening efforts are putting off many voters who are still struggling just to get by as they move beyond the degradation wrought by Trump and Covid.While the Democrats wallow in a family food fight, Americans are still stressed and exhausted from the whole Covid ordeal, confronting high gas prices and stymied from getting the appliances and Christmas toys they want.“I used to advise mayors, you can be as visionary as you want, but just make sure you take the garbage out and fill the potholes,” said David Axelrod, who oversaw messaging for Obama.Republicans have not lost their talent for coming up with boogeymen to scare white voters, and thanks to a dumb comment by Terry McAuliffe in a debate, they have succeeded in turning parents’ rights in schools into a wedge issue.Some in the GOP see Glenn Youngkin as a template for moving beyond Trump. The members of my family who voted for Trump are eager to see their party move back to a more palatable and recognisable form of conservatism. We’ll see.So far, tiptoeing around Jabba the Trump has had limited utility. Despite everything, he still has great sway in the Republican Party. And if the supreme court were to outlaw abortion and approve open carry on guns, that could scramble the equation all over again, sending moderate suburbanites back into the arms of Democrats.Most important, Democrats have to come up with a vocabulary and a vision to elucidate how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework and Build Back Better will benefit people. BIF sounds like Willy Loman’s son, and must we ask, to BBB or not to BBB? Yammering about the budget reconciliation process is not going to cut it. Tonally and emotionally, Democratic pols seem at odds with the electorate.At the end of the day, Democrats are going to get some good stuff for Americans, but voters may not realise that because of the big hash the Democrats made with the bills. Asked on Friday if the Democrats could not get out of their own way, Pelosi smiled dryly and replied, “Welcome to my world. This is the Democratic Party.”She sanguinely referred to the damaging internecine warring as “exuberance”. Right now, the bills seem like a Washington abstraction, and it feels as if Biden has been lost in a maze forever, grappling with the minotaurs of Joe Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema and progressives.It’s analogous to Afghanistan. Biden did the right thing pulling us out of the quicksand, but people are mostly going to remember the catastrophic visuals of the botched exit. There is a feeling, many Democrats say, that things are a little out of control – the Afghanistan departure, supply chains, crime, violence, Biden not being able to pass what he wants to pass or even pressing for the votes when he went to the Hill before he left for Europe.The administration lost control of the virus story it didn’t seem to have it together on mask or no mask, school or no school, vaccine mandates or no. Friday’s strong jobs report and a rollout for the children’s vaccine gives Democrats a breather, but many are still wondering if Biden is up to the job. He will need to become a much better salesman than Biff Loman’s dad. – This article originally appeared in The New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"hot air greenwash truth behind cop26 pledges coal cash trees","story":"The pledges have flown thick and fast every day the Government and other authorities are making one bold announcement after another on the success of talks determining the future of the planet. But halfway through Cop26 in Glasgow, the reality may not be living up to the hype.An analysis by The Daily  suggests a large gap between official communique and the stark truth.The UK made a breakthrough announcement last Thursday that 190 countries and organisations were now committed to phasing out the use of coal. In an official release, Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business and Energy secretary, declared that “spearheaded by the UK’s Cop26 presidency… the end of coal is in sight”.Critics were quick to accuse the Government of overselling the deal. Although the announcement sounded impressive, the number of countries signed up totalled just 45 and did not include the US, China, India or Russia. Wales was cheekily included as an extra nation alongside the United Kingdom. The Government had also added to the pledge 120 entities who had already signed up to a separate Powering Past Coal Alliance agreed as long ago as 2017.Even of the 190 entities that the Government was including, it emerged that only 23 were countries with new commitments and six of those had not fully committed. Ten of the countries that were signed up to the pledge don’t actually use the fossil fuel in their power stations.The wording of the pledge also appeared to be watered down with a commitment to end coal power for developed nations by 2030 and by 2040 for developing nations. Crucially, a caveat was added “or as soon as possible thereafter”.For example, Indonesia, a major coal user, agreed to phase out coal “into the 2040s” but only on condition of receiving financial support. Poland declared itself a developing nation to fit in with its own deadline of 2049.In Cop26’s first major deal, Boris Johnson announced that 110 countries – “more leaders than ever before” in the prime minister’s words – had made the “landmark” commitment to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. The pledge includes £14bn of public and private funds to encourage success.This all sounded like quite the breakthrough until experts pointed out it was hardly a “landmark” at all. A similar pledge was made in 2014 at the New York Declaration on Forests and five years on was declared a failure. That declaration, endorsed at the 2014 UN climate summit in New York was endorsed by 150 governments, companies and other organisations. The deal pledged to halve deforestation by 2020 and end it by 2030. But an official report in 2019 said the New York declaration had been a failure and that deforestation had “actually accelerated” in the intervening years.There may be improvements this time round with Brazil – which includes vast swathes of the Amazon rainforest – and Russia among the signatories in Glasgow. Prof Simon Lewis, an expert on climate and forests at University College London, said the political commitment was “good news” but warned the world has been here before in reference to the 2014 agreement which failed to slow deforestation at all.More than 450 firms with assets totalling $130 trillion announced their commitment last Wednesday to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. They signed up to the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). Trumpeted by Mark Carney as a “watershed” moment, the former governor of the Bank of England declared: “Right here right now is where private finance draws the line.” Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, agreed. “This is a historic wall of capital for the net zero transition around the world,” said Mr Sunak.The announcement might have been “watershed” but the figure was “eye watering”, prompting the Financial Times to question the $130 trillion figure, pointing out that “the market capitalisation of the world’s stock markets is only about $120tn” in the first place.Any lay person might have thought this vast sum was being invested to make the world go green. But it did not even include a promise that would prevent financial firms from making investments in fossil fuels.The University of Oxford’s Oxford Sustainable Finance Group said it would not be possible to deliver on climate pledges without “halting the financing of new fossil fuel infrastructure” and the GFANZ did not promise that. One campaign group – Corporate Europe Observatory – said that Cop26 “looks set to become the biggest finance greenwash in history”.Critics pointed out that $100 billion promised to developing countries as long ago as 2009 to battle climate change in 2020 to 2025 will not be delivered until 2023 at the earliest. In other words, it’s all very well talking up a hypothetical $130 trillion, when $100 billion of real money still hasn’t been raised.Led by president Joe Biden and Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, more than 100 nations pledged to reduce global methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. The influential International Energy Agency (IEA) said that with all the commitments being made at Cop26, the world was now on course to limit any temperature rise to 1.8C by the end of the century. This was heralded as a triumph for Cop26 because, pre-conference, the IEA was predicting a temperature rise above pre-industrial levels of 2.1C by the year 2100.The Global Methane Pledge comes with caveats. Major emitters like Russia, China and India have not signed up and the commitments are all voluntary.The IEA announcement comes with its own pinch of salt. The United Nations points out that even with these national plans in place, all greenhouse gas emissions will rise by 13.7 per cent by 2030. In fact to keep to 1.5C, emissions need to fall in the next decade by 45 per cent.Even the IEA is sceptical. Dr Fatih Birol, its executive director, said its updated analysis showed that the targets would need to be “met in full and on time” to hold the global temperature rise to 1.8C. But he added: “we still fall well short of what is needed to keep the door open to 1.5C.”More from NewsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson to skip sleaze debate but will \u0026#39watch Commons from office\u0026#39 Rescue mission to save man trapped in Welsh cave for two daysBoosters will see Covid \u0026#39fade into the background\u0026#39, Oxford scientist saysBritish mother\u0026#39s missing three-year-old found dead in Portugal near body of father in suspected murder-suicidePoliceman wounded after being stabbed in \u0026#39terrorist\u0026#39 attack in southern FranceMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"policings macho culture must end restore public trust says chief","story":"The macho culture of policing will be brought to an end to restore public trust, the police chief responsible for standards in the profession has said.Writing for The , Chief Constable Andy Marsh, who heads the body overseeing training and codes of behaviour, said policing needed a cultural overhaul to root out misogyny and sexism, end officers covering up for each other  and restore trust in the profession.He said police could no longer blame a few bad apples for the loss of trust and instead said his College of Policing aimed to make it an inhospitable profession for any new recruits or officers who brushed off macho behaviour or toxic comments as banter.He said meeting the Government\u0027s target of 20,000 extra officers would require 50,000 new recruits – equivalent to 40 per cent of workforce – and offered a once in a generation chance to rebuild policing\u0027s reputation with an enhanced input on ethics and integrity at the start of careers.The college, with the National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council (NPCC), has already drawn up compulsory ethics courses to warn new recruits against abuse of office in their dealings with the public and make clear that they face disciplinary action and ejection from the force if they do so.The Government\u0027s police recruitment campaign is a once in a generation opportunity to shape the future of the service, wrote Mr Marsh. For example, there is enhanced input on ethics and integrity – and, for the first time, training in vulnerability and crime committed online or digitally – at the start of their careers.These elements are at the heart of many of the recent cases that have undermined public confidence.The moves follow the murder, rape and kidnap of Sarah Everard by Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, which led to a torrent of misconduct claims against police.They include claims that three serving police officers shared misogynistic and racist messages on a WhatsApp group with Couzens, 48, who was known as the rapist in his previous force.Mr Marsh said: I recently heard someone use the phrase \u0027if you can\u0027t trust the police, then who can you trust?\u0027. This might be a summary of the public\u0027s attitude towards the police right now, implying a concerning loss of trust.In recent months, we have seen cases where officers have been convicted of unconscionable acts, while inappropriate behaviour has been overlooked. It simply isn\u0027t enough to say that this is a case of a few \u0027bad apples\u0027.The British public is attuned to what happens in policing and does not accept this as a few isolated incidents, but rather sees a service that needs a cultural overhaul to root out misconduct.Macho behaviour in stations and toxic comments made and brushed off as \u0027banter\u0027 need to end. The public will not tolerate situations where officers protect each other from wrongdoing, and professionals in policing need to feel empowered to challenge behaviour.The College of Policing is responsible for setting standards for the police in England and Wales. Our aim will be to make policing inhospitable for officers and staff who undermine the service\u0027s mission, betray our code of ethics or do not deserve to serve the public.Mr Marsh said it was also vital that British police remained one of the most scrutinised in the world through local politicians, inspectors and Government oversight because openness is an antidote to mistrust.More from NewsRescue mission to save man trapped in Welsh cave for two daysPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson to skip sleaze debate but will \u0026#39watch Commons from office\u0026#39 Boosters will see Covid \u0026#39fade into the background\u0026#39, Oxford scientist saysBritish mother\u0026#39s missing three-year-old found dead in Portugal near body of father in suspected murder-suicidePoliceman wounded after being stabbed in \u0026#39terrorist\u0026#39 attack in southern FranceMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"putins chef wanted fbi denies links paramilitary forces online","story":"The Russian businessman dubbed “Putin\u0027s chef who is wanted in the US for alleged electoral fraud has broken cover to insist he is a “pacifist with “no connection whatsoever” to Moscow-backed mercenary groups.In the first ever interview given to the Western press, Yevgeny Prigozhin sought to set the record straight and rebut allegations that he is the financial backer of Russian troll farms and paramilitary forces.Mr Prigozhin, 60, said the West “cannot seem to grasp” what motivates Russia, but that his country and Britain cannot move closer diplomatically as Washington would see it as “driving a wedge” between the allies.Speaking exclusively to The , the notoriously media-averse businessman spoke of the diplomatic relationship between Russia and the West and said it was currently not possible to rebuild trust with Britain.Known as Putin’s chef due to his lucrative catering contracts with the Kremlin, Mr Prigozhin said he had been to events with President Putin on several occasions, but has “no relationship whatsoever” with him and has “no insights” into the Russian leader’s thoughts.He denied in the strongest terms any link between himself and Russian paramilitary forces, specifically the shadowy Wagner Group, thought to be active in Ukraine, Syria and across Africa, as revealed by The  in April.“Relations between the citizens of the United Kingdom and Russia, in my view, are quite friendly and warm,” Mr Prigozhin said.“However, I think relations between countries are always difficult to characterise because they depend heavily on each country\u0027s political position and the political landscape at a particular moment.“As far as I can tell, the UK and Russia do not have an independent state-to-state relationship, except in a purely formal, diplomatic sense. UK policy towards Russia always follows US foreign policy towards Russia. The US has defined its relationship with Russia, and also China, as one of “great power competition”.“So the relationship between the UK and Russia is this: the US and Russia are great powers in competition with each other, and the UK has volunteered to help the US in that competition.”Mr Prigozhin grew up in Vladimir Putin’s home city of Leningrad.In 2001, he personally served Mr Putin and visiting Prime Minister of Japan, Yoshirō Mori, at his restaurant. He subsequently won numerous catering contracts with the Kremlin, including for Mr Putin’s birthday celebrations in 2003.He said he hopes relations between the UK and Russia “do not get any worse” but wondered “how would it be possible for Russia to “rebuild trust” with the UK as long as the US defines Russia as its great-power competitor”?“My personal view is that it makes no sense even to try, as any attempt by Russia to improve relations with the UK will be interpreted by the US as Russia driving a wedge between the US and its ally.“If and when Russia and the United States find an accommodation to coexist and trade peacefully, the UK will inevitably follow suit.”The recent Aukus submarine deal between the US, UK and Australia was an example of Britain’s subservient relationship with Washington, he said.“France withdrew its ambassadors from Washington and Canberra in protest, but did not take any action against London, because there was no point in it. The British joined the deal because the Americans asked them to join,” he said.Mr Prigozhin has been linked to the Leningrad-based Internet Research Agency (IRA), widely seen by Western security officials as a troll farm and source of disinformation.In April this year, the FBI sanctioned Mr Prigozhin, saying the IRA was responsible “for interfering in the 2016 presidential election”.The FBI offered a reward of $250,000 for information leading to the arrest of Mr Prigozhin.The FBI Wanted poster states: “Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin is wanted by the FBI for his alleged involvement in a conspiracy to defraud the United States by impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the Federal Election Commission, the United States Department of Justice, and the United States Department of State.”US authorities allege Mr Prigozhin has “evolved from simply providing financial support to his global disinformation network to also writing content to denigrate the US electoral process”.Mr Prigozhin strongly denies the allegations and told The : “I have never served in the Russian government and, it bears repeating, I am not closely acquainted with President Putin”.Relations with Russia are at their lowest point since the Cold War, due mainly to the 2014 annexation of Crimea and sponsorship of separatists in eastern Ukraine.The West accuses Russia of interference in domestic political issues, such as the 2016 US Presidential election and the Brexit vote, and of assassinations of political opponents.Alexander Litvinenko was murdered in 2006 in the UK after drinking tea laced with polonium-210, a lethal radioactive substance. A non-judicial public hearing in 2014-15 said it was highly likely Russia was responsible.In March 2018, a former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with the nerve agent novichok, which had been smeared on the front door handle of Mr Skripal\u0027s Salisbury home.Mr Skripal, his daughter and Nick Bailey, a police officer that entered the house, were taken severely ill. All survived, but a local woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after exposure to the nerve agent.Britain said Russian military intelligence officers Alexander Mishkin and Anatoliy Chepiga, of Unit 29155 of the GRU, were responsible for the attack. London expelled 23 Russian intelligence officers working in the UK under diplomatic cover in response.Mr Prigozhin said the West fundamentally does not understand Russia.“The Russian state exists to protect the interests of the people of the Russian Federation and Russian people.“The Russian Federation is not trying to spread democracy, authoritarianism, Communism, Sharia law, or any other ideology.“This is something that people in the West cannot seem to grasp.“If you want to understand what Russia will do in a particular situation, ask yourself what is in the interests of the Russian people, in a real, material sense: sovereignty, prosperity, independence and security.”Addressing the allegation that he is the financial backer for the Wagner Group, Mr Prigozhin said the last news he heard of the Russian paramilitary outfit was an article in Foreign Policy magazine saying it does not exist.However, he questioned why he had been linked to the Wagner Group.“I “have been linked” by whom?” he asked.“By the US government? By the Russian opposition press which receives US funding? By academics who receive US grants? By a UN “Panel of Experts” in which the Deputy Spokesperson of the US State Department is a member?“I do not know why I have become a minor character in America\u0027s geopolitical fairytales.“Perhaps you will also ask me why the US government thought the kids they droned a few weeks ago in Afghanistan were terrorists. I have no idea.

Hospitality industry representatives said clubs across Scotland were exploiting the loophole so they could ignore vaccine passport rules.“SNP ministers should be embarrassed that they designed such a mess of a scheme,” Murdo Fraser, the Scottish Conservative spokesman for Covid recovery, said. “The vaccine passports guidance is so shambolic that places which are clearly not nightclubs are being billed as nightclubs, and places that are clearly nightclubs are managing to use loopholes to claim they’re not.”Nightclubs said they have seen revenues plummet since the vaccine passport scheme fully came into force on Oct 18.

Last winter, social distancing and limited mixing meant that flu cases were much lower than normal, but dangerous viruses spread quickly when people are all crowded together indoors.So this winter it’s important to boost your immunity with both the Covid booster and flu vaccineyou’re eligible. YOUR VACCINE QUESTIONS ANSWERED Who needs a Covid- vaccination booster All those most likely to become seriously ill from Covid- and those who care for them. But first you need to have had your initial two vaccine doses. The booster will be offered to people aged -plus, those with a health condition that puts them at high risk from Covid, people who live and work in care homes, and frontline and social care workers.If I’m eligible, when can I book my Covid booster The NHS will let eligible people know how to get their booster, which they can have from six months after their second dose. People with certain health conditions may be offered it earlier. Thousands of locations across the country offer a Covid- booster, to give people choice and convenient access. If you are eligible, you will be able to book an appointment at a vaccination centre, designated pharmacy or GP-led service using the NHS Covid- national booking service, or you can go to a walk-in service by using the NHS Grab a Jab walk-in site finder. This is alongside many GP-led services and hospitals inviting people to be vaccinated through their services. I’ve tested positive for Covid-, but can I still get a booster Yes, but you should wait  days before bookingyou’ve had a positive Covid test, starting from the date you had the test.Can I get a flu jab at the same time as my Covid booster You’re likely to be offered them at separate appointments, butyou are offered both, it’s safe to have them at the same time.Who is eligible for the free flu vaccine from the NHS  For a full list of those who can get a free flu vaccination see nhs.uk flujab, but they include people aged -plus, those with certain health conditions, pregnant women and frontline health or social care workers. What about kids  Most primary school pupils and those in secondary school years seven to  will be offered the flu vaccination as a nasal spray. Parents or s will need to give consent for this. Children aged between two and threewill be offered a nasal spray by their GP practice. Those aged six months to two years with a long-term health condition that makes them at higher risk from flu will be offered a vaccine injection.Where can I get a flu vaccine Your GP surgery, a pharmacy offering the service, from your midweyou’re pregnant, or at a hospital appointment. School-age children will be offered the vaccine at school. Those that haven’t started school yet or have a long-term health condition can receive the vaccine from their GP.I never get flu – why do I need a vaccine The flu virus kills almost , people and hospitalises tens of thousands more in England in an average year. It’s more important than ever to get your flu jab this year because more people are likely to get it because we didn’t build up natural immunity during the Covid pandemic. If you get flu and Covid at the same time, you’re more likely to be seriously ill. Also, getting vaccinated against flu and Covid- will provide protection for you and those around you for both these serious illnesses.So why didn’t we see much flu in last winter There are several likely factors, including the measures put in place to stop the spread of Covid-. Last winter also saw record levels of flu vaccine uptake.Will we be more vulnerable to flu this year Dferent strains of flu circulate each year. There may be more strains this year as there were so few flu cases last season. Thus there is less immunity against last year’s strains, and they could continue circulating this year along with the new strains.How effective is the flu vaccine It helps protect against the main types of flu virus. While there’s still a chance you might get flu, it’s likely to be milder. The flu vaccine will also stop you from spreading flu to others.I’m pregnant – is it safe to get the Covid and flu jabs Yes – both are safe for pregnant women, and it’s important to have botheligible. There are more risks for you and your pregnancyyou contract Covid- without the vaccine, and the flu vaccine will also help protect your unborn baby. If you catch flu when pregnant, you’re at risk from complications such as bronchitis and it could cause your baby to be born prematurely, have a low birthweight and may even lead to stillbirth. If you’re pregnant you can get a free flu vaccine from your GP, pharmacist or through your maternity service. Are there any side effects Serious side effects are very rare. The nasal vaccine might lead to a runny or blocked nose, headache, tiredness and some loss of appetite. The injection might give you a sore arm at the site of the injection, a low-grade fever and aching muscles for a day or two after the vaccination.“The NHS Covid- vaccine programme, the largest and most successful in NHS history, has protected millions of people and saved around , lives.“Flu and Covid- both cost lives and the increased threat from the two deadly viruses this winter makes it even more important for people to continue sticking to good habits like washing their hands regularly. “Anyone eligible should have their flu vaccine as soon as possible, and their Covid- booster once it has been at least six months since their second vaccine. The vaccines are safe, effective and the best thing you can do to protect yourself and your loved ones this winter.”"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus booster jabs could given","story":"Coronavirus booster jabs could be given out annually to combat any new iantsNadhim Zahawi, who is now education secretary, revealed the plan as the number of people in the UK given a booster shot of a Covid vaccine passed  millionOver  million people have already been given a Covid booster vaccine in the UK Image: Derby ByWilliam WalkerNews Reporter:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsBooster jabs could be given out every year under a new programme to tackle new Covid iants, a minister has said.

The latest attempted coup by the tinpot tyrant, Britain’s Trump stopped from turning the country into a sordid banana republic by widespread revulsion, is thankfully a turning point for a permanently tarnished leader with a record - approval rating. Labour and a freshly angry Keir Starmer are rejuvenated, onfrom Covid isolation, by a Tory toxic crisis that presents a golden opposition opportunity to nail jaundiced Johnson as a shameless charlatan exploiting and letting down the voters who put him into Downing Street. Government contempt for people and Parliament is the rottenness of one-party rule, a PM taking folk for granted unintentionally constructing a persuasive case for radical change at the ballot box.

The Black Cab drivers have been given MRI scans while remembering the quickest routes through London in a bid to find out how their brains store the information. Previous research has shown that London taxi drivers have a larger hippocampus - the region of the brain which looks after learning and memory - than the general population, and it continues to grow the longer they are on the job. The hippocampus is known to shrink in people who have Alzheimer’s so it is thought the latest work will lead to a breakthrough in detecting dementia earlier so patients can receive treatment sooner.  Scientists hope the latest work will lead to the development of diagnostics for detecting dementia earlier so patients can receive treatment sooner. They will share the results with the charity Alzheimer’s Research UK Since  London cab drivers have been required to complete “the knowledge” which involves memorising , landmarks and , streets and is said to be the most challenging memory test in the world. Professor Hugo Spiers, inset, from University College London, who is carrying out the study, called Taxi Brains alongside PhD students, said: “London cabbies have unique brains.

The couple live together in Cha, west London, reports MyLondon.Originally from Sao Paulo, Julianow has more than , followers, and her videos have been watched by over  million people. Sheaposs prolic, posting new content twice a week, alongside working as a singer-songwriter. Eileen, hailing from New Jersey, is retired.  She has a YouTube channel of her own, but, given the demand, the couple decided to start creating more content together on Juliaaposs account. In their videos, they rate each otheraposs outfits, film their travels together and, above all, share the intimacies of their relationship with their followers, from the big momentsto the small . The videos are tagged: Lesbian Age Gap Couple. I think weaposre just lucky that weaposve had this unique opportunity to fall in love and we havenapost been limited by our ages, says Eileen. What comes across [in our videos] is not that weaposre dferent in age, but that weaposre two people who really love each other. They add that they are at a stage in their relationship where they donapost even think about the age gap anymore. Weaposre very used to it, and we donapost even think about it, says Julia.  But there are a few things that are dferent - I mean, I wonapost take Eileen hiking with me. And she knows dferent music and things from a dferent time. Eileen agrees, saying: Weaposre lucky to have met somewhere in this magic middle. She concedes that there are definitely dferences, like having dferent cultural frames of reference. Eileen may have the benefit of experience, but she says their relationship has challenged her views on gender and pushed her feminism to become more intersectional. Iaposve learned from [Julia] things that werenapost part of my experience, she explains. Their friends, they say, are a mix of ages - some closer to Eileen, some to Julia, and plenty in between. They werenapost surprised when Eileen and Julia introduced their new partners. As Eileen puts it: My friends are open-minded. Nobody was too bothered about it...Iaposve never had any kickback, have you  No, Julia responds. My friends have always been very supportive, but Iaposve been with an older woman before, so they were kind of used to it anyway.  She adds: Weaposve never had any problems in public... people stare a little bit, but it could be our hair. It was Eileen who made the first move on Tinder, swiping right and initiating an intense message conversation, before finally asking Julia out on a date. Julia says: We were supposed to go out for dinner, but Eileen was having a problem with her knee, so she askedI wanted to come over to her place. Instead, they ordered pizza and drank wine. Julia says: We got on straight away. We just clicked...Eileen made me feel so comfortable. Eileen may have made the first move, but it was Julia who popped the big question, pulling Eileen up on stage with her at a gig in London to get down on one knee YouTube too.Love is love, Julia says simply, summarising what she wants viewers to take from her channel. As long as youaposre not harming anyone and youaposre just doing your best, you shouldnapost be judged for that. Everybody should focus on being themselves and being kind to one another, instead of judging.

The new climate friendly E fuel could lead to worse problems for drivers because it is less energy dense, meaning motorists will have to use more to cover similar distances. The fuel, that was introduced in September, has won admirers because it contains a higher percentage of renewable fuel - bioethanol. This means it is better for the environment due to the lower levels of carbon emissions. But motoring YouTube channel Number  has warned that E may have far worse problems that could affect all petrol car users. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here The issue, they say, with it being less energy dense means that motorists may have to top up more often, leading to additional costs. In the video, the presenter says: “I need to talk to you about something pretty shocking Iaposve just found out about E fuel. “And it has absolutely nothing to do with the fact it might damage old classics. “No, there is a far worse problem with using E. “It affects every single car on the road which uses petrol whether it is one of the oldest or the very newest car that’s out.” He added: “E causes an increase in fuel consumption for any car thataposs using it. Ethanol is less energy-dense than unleaded fuel.  “So that means that because it has this lower energy density you have to use more and therefore your fuel consumption in your car will go up. “You’re not going to lose any power because your caraposs computer will alter the air-fuel balance to make up for that loss of energy density. “But your fuel consumption will go up. I really couldnapost believe it.” The Department for Transportaposs Introducing E petrol study confirmed drivers would experience lower fuel economy under the new E grade. They confirmed fuel economy may drop by up to two per cent using the new compound. But they said this was ultimately down to the “driving style” of motorists.  The revelation came after concerns were raised by a quarter of private iniduals in relation to fuel economy in the consultation. Drivers questioned about the changes warned this could “mitigate emissions benefits” and could have a “cost impact”. The DfT said: “We have considered the impact on fuel economy and decreasing MPG, which is due to the lower energy density of ethanol compared with fossil petrol when developing our proposals. “Analysis based on average caloric values of the two products suggests fuel economy could reduce by between one and two per cent. “However, the impact will y based on driving style and refinements in fuel blending by suppliers.” According to the RAC, the US Energy Information Administrationclaims the energy content of ethanol is around  per cent lower than unleaded. This means vehicle fuel economy may reduce by around three per cent when using the new fuel. A number of drivers have reported suffering from fuel efficiency problems when using the new fuel. Some Express readers have even complained of receiving up to mpg less since the changes.

Thereaposs often little chance to cook from scratch, especially during the week. Itaposs also a good way of limiting our food waste at a time when weaposre all trying to do our bit for the environment and keep costs down. But itaposs surprising just how much the prices of products can dfer from store to store.To find out how supermarkets compare, the Manchester Evening News visited six stores to buy the same five items.These were Birds Eye potato waffles, Richmond skinless sausages, Birds Eye chicken dippers, Birds Eye omega  fish fingers and Mars ice creams. While some had offers on that would have reduced prices by buying in bulk, we stuck to one of each item for a fairer comparison. We also didnapost take advantage of Tescoaposs Clubcard prices, which would have reduced the bill there.  The pack sizes were mostly exactly the same - with just a larger pack of ice creams in Farmfoods, which weaposve accounted for, and a smaller pack of fish fingers in Iceland, which was balanced out by the larger pack of sausages. We were shocked to discover that overall Tesco came in at the most expensive, at £. for all five items, while Sainsburyaposs - where prices used to be at the higher end - was the cheapest at £.. Thataposs almost a % dference and was helped by the current offer on Mars ice creams, reduced from £ to £. While easier said than doneyour budget is tight or you have little freezer space at home, what our shopping trip did prove was just how much consumers can save by buying in bulk.  At Iceland it was much cheaper to buy two of many of its products - two packs of the skinless sausages for £, saving £. and two packs of Mars ice creams for £, saving £. The same ice cream offer was available at Asda and Morrisons too. And at Iceland a current offer on the -pack of chicken nuggets meant we also got a free pack of  Fab ice lollies worth £. Farmfoods had similar bulk offers, with two boxes of the waffles for £ and the larger box of ice creams bringing the price down too. Had we made use of the Clubcard at Tesco, we could have got the fish fingers for £ instead of £, bringing the overall bill to £. and making it the joint second cheapest along with Asda.

Christian Brueckner fell silent when friends spoke about the vanished toddler, Nakscije Mtari claims - but later admitted being nearby at the time. Ms Mtari also said that the convicted paedophile, now , hit her when she discovered child pornography showing young blonde girls being abused on his phone.In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, she said that Madeleineaposs disappearance had been raised by pals in  at a party in their home in Braunschweig, Germany.But Brueckner made no answer when it was discussed, Ms Mtari said.  When she asked him about it later, she said he told her: “I know about Maddie, I was near the hotel at the time. I was living in the area at the time. I am not going to say anything more. The three-year-old vanished from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in May . Ms Mtari - who has told German police about the conversation - said she was terried of her former partner, who she described as controlling. The relationship, which began when she was , came to an end when he launched a brutal attack on her when she discovered child pornography on his phone and laptop. She said: I asked him about the videos and pictures and that’s when he punched me. Ms Mtari, now , said she fell down the stairs and was unconscious for around  minutes after the attack, which she and her mother reported to the police. Police discovered nearly  photos of children being abused and  videos, including images showing Brueckner abusing the daughter of a previous girlfriend. In  he was jailed for  months for the assault. German authorities identied Christian Brueckner as a prime suspect in Maddieaposs case last year and said they had concrete evidence the missing girl was dead. Investigators are now said to be  per cent convinced the convicted sex offender is the man responsible. But the -year-old has taunted German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who claims to have enough evidence to charge the rapist, saying he is bluffing. Sources close to Brueckner told The Sun Online : B and his legal team remain sure Wolters and his investigators don’t have a shred of evidence to convict him on or charge him over.Their position has always been clear:there is evidence, show it. But the police never have. That’s why they are convinced these comments are a bluff designed to get B to crack behind bars and confess to someone. That will never happen. B believes Wolters is simply a celebrity cop looking to make headlines.” Brueckner is currently serving a seven-year sentence for raping an American tourist in Portugal in  and the prosecution team are taking time to gather as much evidence as possible before bringing allegations to court.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Madeleine MccannCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Saiqa Parveen, , who refused the jab while pregnant, died after Dua was saved by a ­caesarean. Today Saiqa’s brother begs mums-to-be: “For God’s sake, get the vaccine.The heartbroken family of the unvaccinated mum who died from Covid without getting to meet her newborn daughter have begged all pregnant women to get jabbed, Birmingham Live reports.Saiqa died in intensive care after catching the virus while carrying her fth child and before she went into hospital. Last night her distraught family told the Birmingham Live of their pain as they implored other expectant mums to get vaccinated. Releasing a picture of Saiqa fighting for le in hospital – and the beautul baby she never got to hold – brother Qayoum Mughal, , urged: “For God’s sake, get the vaccine.”Saiqa, from Birmingham, was eight months into her pregnancy when she fell ill in mid-September. She was offered a Covid shot in summer but insisted she wanted to wait until her baby was born. As her condition worsened, Saiqa was placed in intensive care and underwent an emergency caesarean section at full term on September . She died this week – leaving behind her husband Majid Ghafur, , and daughters Noor, , Imaan, , Hibbah, eight, and Ayesha, six – and without ever meeting newborn Dua Maryam. Qayoum revealed how Saiqa’s daughters made a heartbreaking final online FaceTime call just an hour before their mum died on November . He told the Sunday Mercury: “They said, ‘Get up mummy, we are waiting, we are missing you, we love you, why are you leaving us behind  Just get up’. They were praying and in tears.” One in five of the most critically ill Covid patients are unvaccinated pregnant women, NHS figures show.Since July, % of patients on special lung-bypass machines were expectant mums who had not had their first jab. Qayoum, a dad of four, said: “I strongly ask all people please get their vaccination, otherwise you will have a bad situation like we are facing. “Get the vaccine and avoid this sort of tragedy. The family is completely broken. There is such a big sadness.” Saiqa had no underlying health conditions and her pregnancy had been routine until she tested positive for Covid on September . Two days later she developed breathing problems and was taken by ambulance to Birmingham’s Heartlands Hospital. She was discharged six days later only to be admitted to Good Hope Hospital on September  with breathing dficulties. Qayoum said: “She was on oxygen and on September  she called my we at pm and said she had signed documents saying thather condition worsened, the doctors could operate to take the baby out. “My we said she sounded very tired and only spoke for a few minutes. That was the last conversation with any of us. “The next morning her husband phoned us and told us that she was on a ventilator and they were preparing to operate. At pm, the doctor called her husband and told him they had delivered a baby girl. “We did not see her because she was on a ventilator in intensive care. She never saw her daughter.”By now Saiqa was also battling le threatening sepsis, a hole in both her lungs, as well as pneumonia and other infections.Qayoum said: “They allowed her husband to see her on October  and the doctor said she was very ill. “The doctor was telling him to talk to her. She was sedated but could hear. “He was talking to her, telling her that her eldest daughter is asking you to get up and ‘where is her birthday gt’ and she is missing mum. As soon as he said this, there was one long tear coming from her eye. That was the first and last reaction we had from her on the ventilator.”  Saiqa died just before pm on Monday. Her death certicate records respiratory failure and Covid- pneumonitis as the cause. Qayoum, who has had Covid himself, said: “Her daughters ask, ‘When’s mummy coming back ’ Saiqa was the most caring person, she couldn’t live without her family. She was a lady of principle. “She cared for everybody and her mother is still alive. She was very hard working and a helpful lady.” He added: “Her husband is crying but he’s got to be strong for his daughters.” The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation says all pregnant women should be offered a Covid jab after studies proved it is safe. Previously it was offered only to pregnant women in frontline health and care or to the extremely clinically vulnerable. More than , mums-to-be have had a first dose and around , a second. Data from over , Covid vaccinations in pregnancy in England and Scotland, and a further , in the US, show there has been no subsequent harm to the foetus or baby. England’s chief midwery officer Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent said: “The Covid- jab can keep you, your baby and your loved ones out of hospital.”For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON NHSHospitalsPregnancyGiving birthNewborn babyCoronavirusSunday PeopleCoronavirus vaccine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The swimmer had been swept out to sea at Little Fistral beach in Cornwall and was spotted thanks to her bright pink swim cap. She was holding a pink float which also helped her to be easily spotted by someone on shore who called  on Saturday at .pm. Newquay and Padstow coastguard rescue teams were deployed along with both Newquay RNLI leboats and the coastguard helicopter from Newquay. The dramatic rescue was caught on camera by the coastguard. In the clip, the woman can be seen being pulled out of the water by a team member before they help her into the helicopter.  Matt Rogers, Team Leader with HM Coastguard said: This swimmer had done a considerable amount to give herself a chance of being rescuedthings went wrong. She not only had a float that was a bright pink colour but was wearing a hat of the same colour too. It meant our caller could help give us information that enabled the swimmer to be rescued quickly. Itaposs a reminder of how quickly things can go wrong even for the most experienced and why you should do all you can to help us help youthe worst happens.  Newquay RNLI later posted: Newquayaposs RNLI leboat volunteers were paged for an immediate launch at .pm on Saturdayafter a  call was received, reporting a swimmer in dficulties at Little Fistral. The RNLI crew responded from the harbour and launched the charityaposs D class inshore leboat from Towan Beach in bright conditions and a moderate south-westerly breeze.  The leboat crew were quickly on scene at Little Fistral, where the woman was rescued from the sea by the crew of the Coastguard search and rescue helicopter and checked over by the Coastguard winch paramedic, before being landed safely on the beach. Colleagues from Newquay and Padstow Coastguard Rescue Teams were also alerted and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency have since praised the woman for giving herself the best chance of rescue by using a highly visible pink tow float and wearing a bright cap, which meant the  caller was able to provide accurate information on her position as emergency crews responded.According to the RNLI,you find yourself in trouble in the water, you can help yourself get back to safety by learning to float. Floating minimises your risk of gasping uncontrollably and breathing in water, which can quickly lead to downing. Here’s how to do it.  Fight your instinct to thrash around First, keep calm and try not to panic. Your instinct will be to swim hard – don’t.  Lean back Lean back, extending your arms and legs, to keep your mouth and nose out of the water and your airway clear.  Gentle movements If you need to, gently move your arms and legs in a sculling motion to help you float.  Catch your breath Float until you can control your breathing. Do this for - seconds or until you feel calm.  Now think about how to get out Only now can you think about the next steps. If you can, swim to safety. If someone is nearby, raise a hand and call for help. Remember,you find yourself in trouble in the water – Float to Live. Read more here. The RNLI volunteers ed at .pm and recovered the leboat onto Towan Beach shortly after low tide . Please be aware, as of last weekend there are no longer RNLI leguards on duty at our local beaches, until spring next year. In an emergency at the coast, call  and ask for the Coastguard andyouaposre calling for someone , stay on scene until you are met by emergency services.

Then he dumped her for another nurse – all behind the back of his trusting we. Fuller, , would go on to abuse scores of bodies in two hospital mortuaries. But his mistress only learned of his grotesque offences when he faced court last week. She told the Sunday Mirror today: “To think I’m associated with someone who did something so terrible is awful. I’m very lucky he didn’t kill me.”  As MPs called for an inquiry into Fuller’s hospital access, the woman, whose identity we are protecting, also revealed:She lived in a studio flat just around the corner from his two victims in the Bedsit Murders. Fuller charmed her and seemed the “perfect gentleman”. They met at a hospital social club, he drank Archers and lemonade and once took her to a Beverley Craven pop concert. Fuller always appeared to be ice cool and “would never get angry”.The woman believed Fuller to be an “ordinary, quiet man” – yet he was an arrogant lothario who had affairs with at least two female colleagues during three marriages. She started dating Fuller in  when he was with second we. Three years earlier he had sexually assaulted and killed Wendy Knell, , and Caroline Pierce, , in Tunbridge Wells, Kent.  The woman, now happily married, said: “I was quite aware of the Bedsit Murders and I was very nervous about them. The murders were in my mind and a lot of young women’s minds. “Little did I know I was actually dating the person responsible. In the back of my mind I do still think, ‘Why was I spared ’ “I was in the right criteria in that I lived in the roads near where the girls worked, I had a bedsit and I was in my s.”  Fuller admitted his guilt last week, four days into a murder trial. It was then revealed in court that he had defiled up to  bodies in hospital morgues. His female victims ranged in age from nine to . The revelations have shaken Fuller’s ex to the core. She told the Sunday Mirror: “He was a perfect gentleman with me. I didn’t see a bad side to him at all.  “There was nothing to lead me to believe he’s the person we’ve now found him out to be now. “He never showed any perversion in bed. He was totally ordinary and normal. There was nothing at all. I still can’t believe that he could be capable and part of me still doesn’t want to believe it, but equally I want him to pay for what he’s done. “I didn’t know anything about the mortuary offences until it came out in court. I was really shocked. The police said to me, ‘Be prepared for a nasty shock’, but I wasn’t expecting anything as horric as this. I just thought it was going to be that there were other women like me, or multiple women that he was dating all at the same time. It’s been a traumatic time.”  She went on: “I was  when I began seeing him and I was with him for just over two years. “I was a district nurse and some of us used to go up to the canteen in Kent and Sussex Hospital . I was at a loose end and trying to make new friends, so I started going to the social club. I remember thinking he was quite odd for a man because he drank Archers and lemonade. “He wasn’t a beer man. He was quite a quiet man, but he was quite friendly. He just seemed like a perfectly ordinary person.”  She remembers Fuller being in a cycling club and doing the -mile London to Brighton ride. One of the club routes went directly past the dyke where he dumped murdered Caroline. Of their dates, she said: “The first outing was to the Folkestone Air Show. We once went to a Beverley Craven concert in London and he would visit me at my flat, but most of it was at the social club at the hospital. “He wasn’t the type of bloke to take me out for dinner or offer to take me anywhere particularly, but he was always pleasant and friendly. He would never get angry. It was hard to know what was going on in his head.  “He was an electrician at Kent  Sussex Hospital at the time. Sometimes when he was on call, rather than stay in his house at Broomhill Bank School, he’d stay in the nurses’ home. “I knew he was unhappy with his we. But our relationship ended because he didn’t want what I wanted and he didn’t want to be with me any more. I had to accept that he didn’t want me and he wanted someone . “I remember him saying to me that he had met another staff nurse and he was going to start seeing her.”  The woman called police last December after news of Fuller’s arrest. She explained: “When I saw his name I thought, ‘Well, Fuller is a common surname’. I looked at my phone hours later and there was a photo of him. I recognised him from the fact his eye was turning in. I was really shocked.” Fuller’s arrest came after a DNA breakthrough. A search of his home uncovered hard drives revealing prolic sexual offending of a kind no British court has seen before. Between  and , he had filmed and photographed himself sexually abusing the bodies of dozens of women and girls at the Kent and Sussex Hospital and nearby Tunbridge Wells Hospital. Fuller admitted two counts of murder at Maidstone Crown Court. He previously admitted  sexual offences, including  counts relating to  identiable mortuary victims. MPs have called for a public inquiry. And the daughter of one victim said: “It kills me to think of David Fuller’s hands on Mum in the mortuary.” Meanwhile, his shaken ex is having counselling. She added: “What he did is up there with the Moors Murderers, the Wests and Shipman. If I could eradicate it all, I would. I keep thinking, ‘Why was I so naive and stupid to get involved with someone like him ’” aposFailure to learn lessons of Savileapos - Comment, by Mark Williams-Thomas, the ex-cop who exposed Jimmy Savile The dead deserve as much dignity as the living, but David Fuller denied victims any respect whatsoever. He got away with murder for  years. Evading capture, he convinced himself he was untouchable. And, like all sex offenders, he then sought out vulnerable victims – dead women and children – to fulfil his warped sexual desires. But it is only by luck and the arrogance of Fuller that the police uncovered sexual offending as far back as  at two Kent hospitals because he kept “trophies” of his attacks and records of his abuse. In , I exposed Jimmy Savile – the DJ and TV star who sexually assaulted patients for decades across the NHS. It led to  hospitals undertaking urgent reviews.But it is clear now that lessons were not learned and, yet again, the most vulnerable in our society have been failed. In  Fuller had a criminal records check which revealed he had hidden a string of burglary convictions. Yet he stayed in post. Fuller should have been sacked immediately. So why wasn’t he  Crimes of necrophilia are extremely rare and carry a maximum jail term of just two years. Post-Savile, a review highlighted the need to reduce access to mortuaries, yet this was clearly not the case at two Kent hospitals.  When Fuller murdered Wendy and Caroline he took trophies – something he repeated will all his future victims. That brings with it considerable risk because it’s a forensic link to the victim and compelling evidence. So why take such a risk  I have no doubt Fuller kept trophies so he could relive his attacks and watch footage again, enabling him to get perverse sexual gratication. I’ve no doubt Fuller has abused many more women and young people. His offending will be far wider than hospital mortuaries.

Thataposs because according to a former royal chef she has an unusual technique for eating the fruit so she doesnapost look like a gobbling monkey. Unlike the rest of us, Her Majesty refuses to peel and then eat it, instead, she peels it with a kne and fork. According to Darren McGrady, who once worked in the royal kitchens, the Queen would cut the top and bottom off, then slice the skin away -ways. She then chopped it up into small pieces before eating them with a fork.  Being strict about the way she eats bananas isnapost the Queenaposs only food quirk. She will never eat or serve, garlic - even on formal occasions. Although she has good reasons behind this - itaposs because the royal family have to meet and greet so many people so never wants the smell of garlic on her breath. Shellfish is also a no go area as itaposs one of the foods most likely to cause food poisoning. However, it was recently reported the Queen has given up one of her nightly habits when it comes to food and drink.

Sheaposs now believed to be foregoing her nightly cocktail on the advice of doctors so she is as healthy as possible. It was said that the Queen, , enjoyed a martini most evenings although she is rarely seen drinking in public and isnapost a big drinker. But it is now thought Her Majesty is shunning alcohol altogether - except for at special occasions. Her decision to give up booze is not linked to any health issues and a palace source said: It is a recent and personal decision by the Queen. Meanwhile, a family friend told Vanity Fairaposs royal correspondent Katie Nicholl: The Queen has been told to give up her evening drink which is usually a martini. It’s not really a big deal for her, she is not a big drinker but it seems a trle unfair that at this stage in her le she’s having to give up one of very few pleasures.” Comment MORE ON The QueenRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The monarch delivered a video message to world leaders and governments at a reception at the climate change summit in Glasgow. In her speech she said there is always room for hope despite huge challenges of the climate emergency. She called on world leaders to recognise “that the time for words has now moved to the time for action”. There was also a touching tribute to her late husband Prince Philip and she spoke of her great pride of her son Charles and grandson William taking on the baton to campaign for the planet. Valentine Low, royal correspondent for The Times, said in a piece on Saturday that the speech sheds light on the current dynamics working within the Royal Family.He said: The passage in which she said how proud she was of the work done by the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge may not have received the attention that it deserved.  Her remarks may also reflect a greater closeness between the three of them. A royal insider also told the publication that the three leading royals are all in alignment on the problems The Firm has faced in recent years. In her speech last week she told how she had been inspired by young people and their enthusiasm to campaign on the issue. She said she had drawn great comfort and inspiration from the relentless enthusiasm of people of all ages – especially the young – in calling for everyone to play their part.She also used her address to pay tribute to her late husband Prince Philip and his decades-long efforts on raising the profile of climate change, quoting from a speech he gave in .Comment MORE ON The QueenPrince WilliamPrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Laura Evans, and Ed Knight, both , set themselves a challenge of making a Caddy Maxi van into a liveable space. The couple from Kingston-upon-Thames, London, deliberately purchased a small van to show others that home on wheels doesn’t always have to be big. The ‘adventure van’ was once used for workers of an energy and home services provider but now it is kitted out with a kitchen and bed. The couple used repurposed materials such as wood and even made a skyline roof by inserting a square window. Laura, who is a shop assistant, said: “It took four months for us to rip everything out, insulate and convert it into a mini camper. “We wanted to challenge ourselves and be creative as the pandemic put a halt on our international travel plans. “The van was in excess of £,. “And it cost £, on the mechanical work and materials such as reclaimed wood for the , the bed frame and small cupboards.“We tried to cut costs as much as we can by purchasing stuff from Facebook marketplace such as Moroccan tiles for the kitchen.“But we bought the oven brand new to ensure it worked.” All appliances such as the oven with a hob, fridge with freezer, tap with an electric pump, LED lighting, l fresh water and full solar system including a leisure battery were brand new.  But the stone sink was purchased from Facebook marketplace but was too big. Laura adds: The solution was to apossinkapos our basin into the unit and let the countertop form around. We love this finish and we believe it looks better thanwe had just simply placed it on top. Just like the kitchen doors, we used Scottish Elm for our countertops but kept the live edges and Eddy cleverly used a jigsaw to cut a waney edge to follow the curvy doors at the end of each unit.  Eddy made solid Elm shaker doors in the kitchen with close weave Rattan  which is a natural cane woven material. It is a biodegradable material which looks amazing. From the outside, the blue vehicle looks like any other Volkswagen van but inside it is a shabby chic space. With a wooden ceiling and laminate flooring, the van boasts enough room for two people but one cannot stand due to the low ceiling.  Ed said: “This is an adventure van - used for sleeping and eating. Itaposs perfect for curling up in bed and watching a movie but it is built as an adventure van so not one for spending days inside. “We loved seeing people’s reaction when we have opened the door in a public place. “They always had to double-take - especiallythey see us with a meal as you would never think there is a working kitchen in it.  “We wanted to show others that you don’t need a massive van to make a home. “We still have our home comforts such as fluffy pillows and a comfy mattress but you can’t stand up.” Ed, who is a joiner, insulated the van and did most of the handy work whilst Laura focused on bargain hunting and interior. The couple spent eight hours per day over eight weeks transforming the van into a living space.  They went on to travel around Cornwall and Isle of Skye, Scotland, before selling it. Ed said: “Laura did the finishing touches too such as most of the painting, oiling and sanding. It is much better to buy an ex-service van because it has been looking after and the mileage is good. “With clever designs, you can do it cheaper - making it better in the long run. “Laura lost her job in events as a result of the pandemic in December . “She began working part-time so this gave her something more to focus on. “We spent a total of £, and made some profit when selling it on.

The professor warned that it increased the risk of premature delivery as well as risk to the child. His call came as the family of a woman who died last week before getting the chance to hold her new-born daughter made their own plea for people to get the jab. Prof Finn told the BBC : So pregnant women wherever you are in your pregnancy, come forward, get vaccinated and protect yourself and your baby as soon as you can.There are no described risks and very large numbers of pregnant women have now received these vaccines without any report of lost pregnancies or damage or injury to the foetus. So far no evidence at all of any risks of the vaccine, but lots of evidence of real risk of the infection. Saiqa Parveen, , from Birmingham, was taken to hospital in September after contracting Covid-, the broadcaster reported, and her daughter was delivered by emergency caesarean section when she was eight months pregnant.  She died on November  before getting a chance to hold her new-born child. Her brother, Qayoum Mughal, said: I pray to everybody, please, get the vaccine. Save yourselves and your loved ones. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists , previously said it was vital pregnant women received both vaccines as well as the third dose booster vaccinethey are eligible for it. Chief scientic adviser for the Department of Health and Social Care, Professor Lucy Chappell, told BBC News: Of women, over % unvaccinated with Covid- in hospital. Never too late in pregnancy to get vaccinated or have conversation with midwe or GP or obstetrician and we can reduce number of people in hospital and intensive care. Overwhelming data on safety on vaccines is very positive.

She said he was scanning the area intensely while walking towards Lorraine’s passenger seat. Lorraine said: “At this point I started to get really panicky and I just froze. “I couldn’t really do anything, I just froze.” The man continued to slowly approach Lorraine but it was at this point that three-year-old Toby saw him getting ‘too close’ and began to react to his ‘strange’ presence. Lorraine said: “Toby started barking and going mad at him and then straight away the man jumped and ran straight back into his car and drove away very quickly. “I’m just really happy I had my protector with me. He’s naturally a protective breed and because of our bond he will always protect me.”  Lorraine said the incident freaked her out as she has never been in a situation like that before and despite being trained in kickboxing she didnapost know how to react.Writing about the incident on a community Facebook page, Lorraine said: “If I had been on my own, this might have been a dferent story - luckily my German shepherd is protective of me.“Iaposve been at this beach before and never had anything like this happen and there is always people camping the night there so never usually though anything strange about people being parked up there. “Hopefully this post will make people aware there are some weirdos about and to be extra careful, so glad I have a German shepherd to protect me.” The man was said to be wearing a black tracksuit and and black crew neck t-shirt. He had a shaved head with blonde hair, was of a slim build and approximately ft  in height from what Lorraine could make out. Lorraine says she is still shaken up after the incident and in future she will continue to walk Toby with her husband like she would usually do.

Describing the horrendous incident a witness said that one of the eight who died passed away in his arms after the deadly stampede in Houston, Texas. The tragedy happened during a performance by rapper Travis Scott at a music festival he launched. More than a dozen people were rushed to hospital and at least eight people died in the crush at Astroworld Fest on Friday. A -year-old was among those hurt, officials said. Festivalgoers have gone on to describe the chaos as people surged to the front, with footage showing fans dancing on ambulances trying to reach those hurt. Speaking to CNN witness Selena Beltran said she saw the crowd act like animals at the event.She said she struggled to breathe as the crowd tightened and saw people trampling over unconscious people on the ground. She said: I fell backwards and it felt like it was the end for me. To think thataposs how Iaposll die, I was so scared. I did not know what to do.  It was all happening so fast, but so slow and I couldnapost react. I just screamed.I was shocked to see people act so inconsiderate and feral. It was insane to see so many just run others over like wild animals.People did not care, they still tried to squeeze through just to get to the front without thinking of the consequences and who it would affect.  She said looking around she thought aposthere was little humanity in that crowdapos and said she saw bodies of people she had performed CPR on being taken away by medics. Another man who was at the concert, Billy Nasser, said he saw people unable to breathe and call out for help. He told the outlet: I picked some kid up and his eyes rolled to the back of his head, so I checked his pulse. I knew he was dead. I checked the people around me. And I just had to leave him there, there was nothing I could do. I had to keep going. Kids were dropping left and right. An ICU nurse who went to the show, Madeline Eskins, said she had never seen anything like it.  TK Tellez, , said that people were trying to get help but nobody heard and called the incident horrying, adding: People were screaming for their lives, and they couldnapost get out. Nobody could move a muscle. Scott was onstage performing a set which included a guest appearance from rapper Drake when the fatal crush occurred.Officials said a crowd began to rush towards the stage at about .pm local time and revellers began passing out because they couldnapost breathe, KHOU reported.Anxious fans tried to get the attention of crew members by climbing onto a camera tower, video shows. Within  minutes, overwhelmed officials had declared a mass casualty incident because there were so many victims.  Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pena said hundreds of people were treated at the scene for injuries. The crowd began to compress toward the front of the stage, and people began to panic, he said. Mr Pena said there were around , people in the crowd when it happened. The remainder of the festival has been cancelled. In a statement Astroworld said: Our hearts are with the Astroworld Festival family tonight. We are focused on supporting local officials however we can.

Of course, administering eyelash extensions is a very particular skill, and being so close to the eye, thereaposs a lot that can go wrong in the wrong hands. So, you can understand just how horried one lash technician was, when she had a client come in to have a set of botched lashes removed, after an unqualied beautician stuck them on using hair bonding glue. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.TikTok user IPS Beauty @ipsbeautytook to the app to share a clip of the botched lashes, insisting it should be illegal for any client to be left with their lashes in such a poor state.A client came in for a removal today, I was horried, the technician wrote on the clip. Extensions applied with hair bonding glue and zero isolation. This should be ILLEGAL! The beautician went on to explain how her client had been left with very few of her own lashes after trying to remove the extensions at home resulted in her pulling most of her lashes out. Ouch. Look at how sparse her natural lashes are. She came to me like this so the other lashes were probably ripped out, she wrote. Understandably, the beauticianaposs followers were also left horried over the lashes, with many accusing the person who did the botched job as a aposfakeapos. What is wrong with all these FAKE lash techs! If you can’t do it properly don’t do it, one follower commented, while another added: Iaposm still f**king learning and I can do better.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Brandon Anderson, who helps professional cleaners find clients, recently showed off a video of someone doing just this to a filthy carpet. However, viewers who saw the clip on TikTok were horried by the sheer amount of dirt involved - as they initially just assumed that the carpet was a chic dark grey colour. But as the expert went at the fabric with a steam cleaner, the carpet can be seen to completely transform back to its original shade. And it wasnapost meant to be grey at all - it was in fact beige. The carpet had so much dirt and grime in it that it had darkened over time due to lack of care. Thousands of people have watched the clip, mesmerised by the cleaning process.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. One person replied: But HOW ! Another said: This is why I HATE carpet. I donapost believe it, proclaimed a third. Someone  wrote: GROSS.  My eyes went from wide to wider, admitted a dferent user. A sixth person added: Throw away the whole house. Others thought that it was nasty and shared comments with the vomiting emoji. This comes after a dferent TikTok user had a similar experience with the laminate flooring in their new home. Posting under the name @dandycleans she uploaded a clip on to the social media  showing her scrubbing a section of her floor and as she wipes, it becomes lighter and lighter. The video was captioned: When I moved in I just thought the floor was dark. The floor initially did appear to be dark, but her hard work soon reveals the regular laminate flooring underneath. More than , people watched her clean, with over , liking it. However, some people werenapost quite so impressed, with a few wonderingsheaposd actually cleaned the floor or just removed the stain. But @dandycleans was quick to insist that it was laminate flooring and it really was just THAT dirty. Have you ever made a gross discovery like this  Let us know in the comments below.

Sometimes it can go great, but sadly, thataposs not always the case, and many daters have experienced being catfished, or arguably worse their date not showing up at all. One woman has revealed how she thought her date had done a runner halfway through their date, after he disappeared for  whole minutes after conveniently aposforgetting his wallet.aposTikTok user Ashleigh @hai_im_ashleigh_had been speaking to her date aposPaulapos for several months before they were able to finally meet up, due to conflicting schedules, but when he heard she was hanging out at a shopping centre near where he lived, he offered to come over and meet her.  Since Ashleigh was with a friend, Paul offered to treat them both to dinner and she admits he seemed to be a very nice guy. We met him at a LongHorn steakhouse - he shakes her hand and hugs me, she explained in a TikTok clip.

And me and my friend just decide to leave and go grab some McDonaldaposs because I wasnapost really in the mood to get a steak dinner at that point. But, as they were leaving the restaurant, the pair noticed Paulaposs car parked up nearby, so Ashleighaposs friend decided to march up to the vehicle and confront him.

I was going to a wedding, and Iaposm super, super pale - I am really freckly and white. So, I just asked the girlshe would do it twice, so much darker, Derrie explained. At first, the mum didnapost notice much of a dference to her complexion and it wasnapost until she woke up the following day that she realised sheaposd made a huge mistake. Derrie said: You have to leave it on for eight hours and then wash it off after, and it was just getting darker and darker and darker.

The -year-old woman was out enjoying a meal with her family in a restaurant which was catered to families and young children, when a child aged around nine started yelling, running up and down the aisles and doing cartwheels. It was annoying but we just ignored him and carried on with our meal. His mother was sat at their table talking to the adults she was with and completing ignoring her son apart from occasionally telling him to come and finish his food, the woman wrote on Redditaposs Am I The A**hole forum.We were sat in a booth and I had my stuff on the bench next to me, including a hat. One of the many times he ran past our table, he stopped, picked up my hat and put it on. Just as the boy went to run off with the hat, the woman sharply told him, give that back right now, and he obliged, with an embarrassed look on his face. The woman went on to tell him it is extremely rude to take other peopleaposs things without asking, donapost do that again. The child then glanced over at his mum and caught her attention, prompting her to come over and see what was going on.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. His mum heard part of what I was saying as she came up to us and angrily told me to leave her son alone I explained that he had taken my things and I was telling him not to, she explained. She told me I shouldnapost stick my nose in and that as heaposs aposjust a kidapos and that I should have just let him play with the hat, or asked for it back nicely without scolding him. The woman then turned to Reddit to question whether she was justied in aposscoldingapos the child, and she was met with overwhelming support. I have four kids and I would be absolutely appalledthey acted this way in public, one Reddit user commented, while another added: Kid needs to learn some manners somehow and it seems like his mum isn’t going to be the one teaching him how to act properly in public. Kids shouldn’t be allowed to run around inside a restaurant for any reason, let alone do cartwheels, a third wrote. They could knock someone’s food over, hurt themselves or someone who’s just trying to do their job or enjoy a meal out.

Impact from the asteroid could be devastating, but thankfully, it dose not pose a threat to the planet. The asteroid will fly by the planet at a distance of . million kilometres - a distance greater than  times of that between the Earth and the moon.  Nereus is  metres long, which makes it larger than % of asteroids, but tiny compared to large asteroids, according to Space Reference. The asteroid orbits the sun every  days though it is predicted not to come close to the Earth again until March ,  and then November . Its closest approach will not happen for another  years in February . Discovered in  by US astronomer Eleanor F. Helin, Nereus is a member of the Apollo group of asteroids which are known for crossing the path of the Earth as it orbits the Sun. Scientists have considered missions to the asteroid, but plans have fallen through each time.  NASA proposed sending the Robotic Asteroid Shoemaker Rendezvousprobe and Japan assessed sending the robotic spacecraft Hayabusa to Nereus, but both ultimately chose other targets.

proportion of the Scottish population who have received the first and second dose of either the Oxford AstraZaneca or the Pfizer BioNTech vaccination so far.Data on the number of people vaccinated was initially provided in a weekly report from Public Health Scotland, however there was immense pressure to keep the public more regularly informed so on January  the statistics began to be provided each day.The chart below shows the daily numbers of first and second doses provided.The chart below shows the cumulative number of people who have received each dose since the vaccination programme began on December .It#s also helpful to look at this data as a proportion of the Scottish population so you can see how the percentage of people vaccinated grows over time.The chart below shows the progress for each UK country.On January , Public Health Scotland provided this data broken down by vaccine type which is shown in the chart below.The map below shows the available data on the regional rollout of the vaccination programme.January  saw the release of data by local authority area for the first time, which is shown in the map below.Regional data was originally available on a weekly basis but moved to a daily upload on February . The chart below contains data on the daily number of doses provided and the population covered. Use the drop down box to select your area and the buttons to move between daily vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations and the percentage of the population who have received first doses.Similarly to the regional data, data by demographics were originally provided in the weekly PHS report # however on February  they moved to a daily publication schedule.The chart below shows the daily number of people who have had first doses in each age range as well as the percentage of that population covered.There is limited data available on vaccinations in pregnancy, however we do have monthly data on the number of people vaccinated by pregnancy trimester.Coronavirus in Scotland # track the spread with these charts\" title\"#Coronavirus in Scotland # track the spread with these charts# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news specials coronavirus-in-scotland-track-the-spread-in-these-charts-and-maps embed # secretanuYMBbtv\" data-secret\"anuYMBbtv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Coronavirus in Scotland – here are the key demographics\" title\"#Coronavirus in Scotland – here are the key demographics# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news specials coronavirus-in-scotland-here-are-the-key-demographics embed # secretbLHWrhpUp\" data-secret\"bLHWrhpUp\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Let us knowthere is something  you think we should be tracking by emailing lkelly@dctmedia"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures october 22 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThis week we feature a series of photographs by Ardrishaig resident James Bowe.Taken on Friday October  during an early morning walk to Cairnbaan, James captured the scene as the sun rose on a beautul day after a spell of rain.

We created two or three good chances but in the second half we conceded early from a mistake and then ran out of steam but overall I was happy with the performance.ldquoWe had four players making their debut, Andrew Mackay, Ben Viola and Lewis Grahame who all signed from Penicuik and Ben Brady, who had just been released by St Mirren played as a trialist.ldquoBenpicked up an injury the second-half and had to go off. Hersquos had issues with his ankle all season and went over on it. He didnrsquot train on Monday night, so wersquoll see how he is for Saturday.ldquoWe have another three players lined up that we like the look of but whether they will be signed and available for Saturday, I donrsquot know right now. Hopefully one or two may be able to play.ldquoSaturday will be a massive game for the club. The Edinburgh Uni and Gretna games probably came a bit too early for us.\"It would have been betterwersquod had three or four weeks with the players first, but it is what it is. I watched Gretnarsquos Scottish Cup game against Berwick Rangers and have received some reports on them but they have a new manager so their style of play may have changed..removeldquoBut Irsquove been delighted with the response of the players so far. There has been a good reaction and there was a real enthusiasm in training.

Along with the leboat, the warship HMS Eastbourne, Fishery Protection vessel Vigilant and the US Navy ship Victoria began combing the area between the south of Arran and Kintyre.They were joined later in the search by a Dakota aircraft from Prestwick.An RAF patrol vessel stood by at Campbeltown.Campbeltown leboat reported the discovery of a large piece of timber. It was, however, too heavy to lt aboard and it was not thought to be part of possible wreckage.Then, after six hours, the search was called off. The plane and boats had covered an extensive area of sea.Coastguards using mobile equipment searched along the shores of Arran and Kintyre.Nothing was seen.Police in Campbeltown began investigations into the matter shortly after the leboat put to sea their enquiries are continuing.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAuchencorvie United, one of the teams that came into being in the rural area as a result of the formation of sports clubs among agricultural workers, made their first appearance in local competitive football last Saturday afternoon.Drumlemble supplied the opposition and had a comparatively easy victory by four goals to nil.Auchencorvie had several players of some promise but, as a whole, the team was sadly wanting in science and judgement and the lesson of their first experience should impress on them the fact that mere lusty vigour is not sufficient to win on the football field.In the first half, Drumlemble did not press their undoubted superiority unduly, being content with a one-goal lead at the interval. James Munro was the scorer.In the second half they added three more to the total, D Thomson having two and A Kerr one.At the opening concert of the winter session of the Scottish Clans# Association of London Mr Charles Kelly, a well-known Campbeltown vocalist, sang with much success.His pieces were The March of the Cameron Men, The Lea Rigg, I Passed By Your Window and Until.In all these numbers he

goal last Saturday after an th-minute strike resigned the Kintyre Park side to a narrow defeat away to St Peter#s.Playing at Renfrew FC#s impressive New Western Park, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils started the match brightly, despite another y injury list which saw several established first-team players ruled out and others unavailable due to work commitments.The Pupils took the lead before the -minute mark when John McCallum, playing at right wing in a --- formation, reacted quickest to Craig Lamont#s long throw-in, which bounced up on the dry synthetic surface, to guide a deft looping header beyond the reach of the St Peter#s keeper.The Kintyre side had efforts from left winger Scott Souden and lone striker Sean Grady go wide of the target – the latter#s promising effort deflected wide of goal – while McCallum was released by Grady and rounded the hosts# keeper only for his cutback to be cleared for a corner, away from the feet of the waiting Souden.At the other end, the Pupils had a new-look combination in defence, with full backs Craig Lamont and Michael McKinlay, and Ross Souden in central defence partnered by -year-old debutant Antonio Akoulli, studying in Scotland and hailing from Thessaloniki, Greece.The four had to be alert to the efforts of St Peter#s wingers Menzies and Lewis on either flank, and did so very well for the opening  minutes until a lapse in concentration saw Scott Lewis – signed from fellow WoSFL side Benburb FC for a transfer fee – ghost along the edge of the box and slot home a fine finish across keeper Alasdair Ferguson with his weaker left foot, into the young keeper’s bottom left-hand corner to make it -.Impressively, the Pupils rebounded from this setback and scored with  minutes played when Liam Renton, playing as an attacking midfielder, latched onto a ball from Scott Souden just inside the hosts# box, and turned his marker sharply before guiding a left-footed shot beyond the keeper#s grasp.All the while, the Pupils# deep-lying midfield pairing – a real contrast of experience levels between skipper Keith Mitchell, and Conner Brown beside him making his club debut – continued to break up play and keep the Feathers Inn-sponsored side moving forward.Despite this, there was a further scare in the visitors# penalty area when St Peter#s hit the bar from a powerful volleyed shot on the stroke of half time, but the Pupils# lead remained intact.Into the second half, though, the Pupils were pegged back in the opening few minutes of proceedings, a clever turn and precise shot beyond the grasp of Ferguson providing a fine equaliser.Admirably from a Pupils point of view, there was no onslaught from the ision#s third-placed team, also boasting a loan signing from Greenock FC, another semi-professional side, in their midfield ranks, and smatterings of semi-pro experience across their starting .However, what followed instead was a gradual build-up of pressure which the Pupils had to work increasingly hard to contain, the home side#s willing forwards continuing to probe for openings in the visitors# defence.The hard-working pair of Matthew Lang and Calum Houston were introduced in attack for the Pupils with  minutes remaining, with fresh legs required as the embattled visitors# energy levels began to wane.But even the dismissal of Lewis for the hosts, hitting out at Renton in reaction to a robust tackle from the latter, which earned the Pupils man a booking, couldn#t deny the Paisley side a late, late winner, a long ball going undefended in the Pupils ranks, and slotted home in the box by a St Peter#s midfielder to give them all three points, and in turn deny the Pupils a probably deserved draw.The Pupils# management team conveyed thanks to the travelling players for their efforts, even in defeat, and will surely take consolation from giving experience to young talent in the side, with four club debuts made in the space of week – after -year-old Andrew Renton#s appearance against Rossvale on cup duty – and within that clutch, a potentially very useful defensive addition.Tomorrow , the Pupils are at home to Glenvale FC, from Paisley, again on league duty, with kick off at pm.For more information, visit @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 29 2021","story":"More must be done to prevent the continued spate of

Photographs from the early days up to  are from the collections of the late Robert Grieves and from John Sinclair, two indefatigable photographers whose material is of national Scottish importance. This week#s article is the conclusion.West Coast#s business portfolio now extends well beyond Kintyre.In , it bought the Glasgow Citybus concern which operates on the north side of the Clyde.Two years on, it also picked up a city tour business which is now operated under the City Sightseeing franchise in Glasgow.It also operates the inter-rail station shuttle in the city.An interesting ersication in  was what became a fast passenger ferry link from Campbeltown to Ballycastle while a few years further on, Fairline Coaches, based near the company#s Glasgow Citybus depot in Whiteinch, Glasgow, was absorbed into West Coast.The company also won the contract to operate Citylink#s new Glasgow-Edinburgh Airport service and additionally, partnered Fort William-based Shiel Buses on Citylink#s Glasgow-Fort William and Skye services.Perhaps the biggest and most signicant recent extension of West Coast#s business came with the creation of Borders Buses.

Firstly, I wish to acknowledge and applaud the drive and foresight of the Craig family in building the business from its original heartland in the southernmost area of Argyll.Public transport is full of challenges whether air, sea, rail or road and, as in every field of business le, there are never any guarantees of success.Once any business reaches a successful position, it often requires even more effort to maintain it there, let alone continue to grow it in size and influence.The presence of Covid since  has, of course, created major dficulties for every business virtually across the board.Finally, a word of praise for the staff and especially for those who are engaged on the vital long-distance links, particularly the Campbeltown, Oban and Skye services.These routes are not only amongst the most weather prone in Scotland, they operate almost exclusively over ordinary trunk roads, iniably convoluted in nature and of borderline width for the safe transit of long vehicles.A driver myself, though never on any of these routes, I#m familiar with all these roads and have some perception of the extreme challenges drivers frequently face.To them, and to all the company#s staff and management, I, and I#m sure many readers who are users of the services West Coast Motors provide across Argyll and in other parts of Scotland, offer grateful thanks."},{"url":null,"title":"muddy good rugby festival at taynuilt","story":"More than  players from Campbeltown, Lochgilphead, Oban, Fort William, Mull and Taynuilt took part with some fantastic rugby on display across all the age groups from the Micro P-Ps to the P s.Conditions were damp under foot given the amount of rain that has been falling lately.

Irsquove discovered that kids are eventually glad when they have been taken off excessive use of screens.The trick is to have something engaging to replace it with, as well as to model it myself. Thatrsquos the thing, itrsquos so easy to be a hypocrite to tell my kids itrsquos the end of screen time, while using my phone or writing on my laptop.ldquoBut you are still on a screen, dad! was the rebuke from my astute eight-year-old daughter recently. And she was right, so the rules have to apply to me and my we too.We are slowly getting there. We have no screens before bedtime now, instead a family storytelling session. The hardest part has been establishing the routine with so much to do. But now the kids look forward to it and help make the living room cosy in preparation.And I feel the benefits too. It helps me close down that ruminator in my head, which constantly reminds me of how much I have to do, emails I need to reply to, deadlines I need to meet. Instead I become focused on the moment, on the fact Irsquom sharing the attention of my loved ones and we are all telling stories.I know this now does sound overly romantic, but the thing is nothing can compare to these moments of connection, such as the magic of listening to my wee boy tell another spontaneous chapter of his tale of the haunted pizzeria, or listening to my girls weave a story rooted in their experiences of the day or a favoured fable from their earlier childhood. And Irsquove discovered my we Kate is a good storyteller when given the opportunity.Maybe it felt awkward at first, that we were doing it because I thought we should be rather than because we all wanted to. But that awkwardness soon gave way to excited expectation and genuine enjoyment of the experience. And the darkness helps, itrsquos a blanket which adds atmosphere and allows us to use fairy lights and candles, so in that sense the cold and dark of this time of year is a huge advantage: itrsquos the season for cosy storytelling.The flicker of screens still shine more regularly than the storytelling candles in our house. But the balance is slowly changing. Hallowersquoen helped, it seemed such a natural time for storytelling. And I think I can say we have now established our storytelling sessions as a regular family tradition. When it happens, it feels like ancient magic has entered our house.I run storytelling sessions with parents and many share the challenges I recognise in my own family. All families are dferent, of course, and no child is the same. Buta family storytelling tradition can be established, everyone feels the benefits. Evenonly every now and then, they will be times of real connection that everyone will remember.Soyou fancy trying it and would like my short guide with some reflections and tips, drop me an email. Or maybe you have tips and experiences yoursquod like to share recently, a parent told me that bath time was storytelling time in her house, as she sat on the toilet telling favoured tales to her young children!

There have been countless books about Orwell, one of the most esteemed of last centuryrsquos British writers, but the American memoirist, Rebecca Solnit, has taken this under-emphasised aspect of his le to spin a new angle on his personality, work and outlook. It is a timely and original reappraisal, adding an extra dimension to a figure renowned for his political acuity who, it emerges, was equally interested in flowers.As with her previous works, Solnit is part of the story. She writes that Homage to Catalonia, Orwellrsquos account of his involvement in the Spanish Civil War, shaped her book Savage Dreams: ldquoHe had been one of my principal literary influences, but I had not gotten to know more about him than what he revealed in the books and whatever set of assumptions was ambient. Thatrsquos a sentence Orwell would have been incapable of writing.Following serious illness, and under instructions from her doctor to rest, Solnit left Calornia to visit Orwellrsquos cottage in the Hertfordshire village of Wallington. This was where he and his first we Eileen OrsquoShaughnessy began married le in . When Solnit visited, a few of the roses he planted were still flourishing.In this rustic setting Orwell experimented with flowers and vegetables, hens and goats, while also turning the front room into a village shop. The reality of this romantic bolthole was far from dreamy. Guests found the place so cold, even in June, that weekends were an endurance test. In one of his domestic essays, Orwell commented on the pleasures of May, which included ldquonot wearing underclothes. Many who visited might have been grateful for his cast-offs.Solnit has strong opinions on the signicance of gardening and husbandry in Orwellrsquos le: ldquoA garden offers the opposite of the disembodied uncertainties of writing hellip In an age of lies and illusions, the garden is one way to ground yourself in the realm of the processes of growth and the passage of time, the rules of physics, meteorology, hydrology, and biology, and the realms of the senses. Among much , Orwellrsquos Roses is an exercise ndash not entirely successful ndash in fathoming why people grow attached to the land.Barnhill on Jura, where George Orwell wrote and also gardenedWeaving Orwellrsquos biography sketchily throughout, Solnit is more at ease in the realm of ideas than of gardens. Here, she feels on shaky ground. She does not think like a gardener, nor seem to appreciate its meaning for those who immerse themselves in their own patch of the great outdoors. In Wallington, and later on his sprawling acres on Jura, Orwell kept a detailed diary, noting the progress of his vegetables and fruit trees, how the daffodils were flowering, the number of eggs he had collected, how the goats were faring, and so on. Solnit seems puzzled by this, especially when he asked his we or sister to keep up the diary when he was absent: ldquoItrsquos not clear why he kept these detailed records hellip.Yet this is often what gardeners do, noting what works, when best to plant, or prune, or harvest. Not every diary Orwell kept, not every line he wrote, had a profound political or intellectual purpose. The enormous importance of gardening, to him, might be best summed up in a line from his essay on Mahatma Gandhi: ldquoOur job is to make le worth living on this earth, which is the only earth we have. The soil, and the wildle it nurtured, were for him a source of tangible joy and contentment.Solnitrsquos version of Orwellrsquos le is not intended as a full-scale biography. Instead, its aspirations lie in the author letting her mind roam freely on the connections between Orwellrsquos love of nature and its beauty and his political ideas, between the meaning of cultivating the land in our time, as well as his. In some ways the link is simple and obvious. In Why I Write, one of his best-known and most frequently quoted essays, he wrote: ldquoI could not do the work of writing a book, or even a long magazine article,it were not also an aesthetic experience.At one point Solnit describes Orwellrsquos essay, A Good Word for the Vicar of Bray, as ldquoa triumph of meandering. Orwellrsquos Roses is equally discursive, leaping from Orwell to the Mexican photographer of roses Tina Modotti, or Stalinrsquos insistence on growing lemons out of season in icy Moscow. Some of her literary digressions cover well-trodden ground, such as the erotic photography of Robert Mapplethorpe. Most of them suggest a butterfly-catcher swiping the air, hoping to net something memorable.The urge to wring as much meaning as possible from her material might explain rather too many laboured passages, such as her description of Orwellrsquos declining health: ldquoYou could say that the tuberculosis bacteria had made a garden of his lungs and were flourishing there, feeding on him as though the soft tissue of his lungs was fertile topsoil.Compared to the clarity and elegance of her last book, Recollections of My Non-Existence, Orwellrsquos Roses is heavy-footed, quixotic and uneven. Yet despite its flaws it has one great strength. Recognising the importance of gardening to Orwellrsquos soul and imagination prompted Solnit toto his novels with fresh eyes. The result was to discover hidden depths: ldquoIf you dig into Orwellrsquos work, you find a lot of sentences about flowers and pleasures and the natural world hellip These sentences are less ringing, less prophetic than the political analysis, but they are not unrelated to it, and they have their own poetics, their own power, and their own politics.Orwell never lost sight of what gardening can achieve, compared to writing, politics, or almost any other endeavour. Often, he was prophetic. As COP turns minds to the future, few of his ideas appear more prescient than his injunction on how best to make a mark: ldquothe planting of a tree, specially one of the long-living hardwood trees, is a gt which you can make to posterity at almost no cost and with almost no trouble, andthe tree takes root it will far outlive the visible effect of any of your other actions, good or evil."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13174037.jpg?type=article-full","title":"review-thx-onyx-portable-digital-analogue-audio-converter","story":"A portable digital to analogue audio converter .Good points During development of smartphones and computers, manufacturers have a lot to pack in and certain aspects, such as audio quality components like DACs, often take a back seat or are omitted entirely.These devices take digital files and present them to analogue audio output equipment allowing our ears to pick up the sound waves.The Onyx is a dedicated DAC adapter offering more power than the converters built into smartphones and laptops.

It seems that the whole tide of opinion in Scotland is to participate in political union, either in the UK or the EU, and the word \"independence\" is code for rejecting the UK rather than any realistic national objective.A great danger in confusing state with nation is that when people denigrate the absence of political statehood they appear to denigrate the Scottish nation, for example by claiming that Scotland as a nation can no longer maintain its former educational primacy, operate al ferry services, deal with illegal drug consumption, provide a national health service, maintain a national banking system or deliver a credible legal system all because of malign external influence and despite all of these having been taken for granted before we became obsessed with our national status.If we can focus on the Scottish nation rather than squabble over an illusory state of independence which no one really wants then we will be better able to deal with all of the above issues and more besides.Michael Sheridan, Glasgow.THE HUGE POWER IMBALANCEBRIAN Wilsonwrites that ldquoenergy policy offers the classic example of why inter-dependence within a small island makes a lot more sense than rolling back centuries of history. However, it is not so simple as claiming that ldquothere is an overwhelming argument in favour of co-operation on such matters, no matter how superficially true it might be.What kind of co-operation is it between two parties where one is much more powerful than the other  The UK Parliamentrsquos own website tells us: ldquoParliamentary sovereignty is a principle of the UK constitution. It makes Parliament the supreme legal authority in the UK, which can create or end any law.\"If Westminster ldquocan create or end any law,Holyrood is recalcitrant, Westminster can resolve the situation by legislating, as it did with the EU Continuity Bill.Inter-dependence is rather dferent, in that in many respects it is a statement of fact. For instance, the states negotiating at COP cannot resolve climate issues on their own and must negotiate to try to secure a settlement they all agree with. We know already, for instance, that India is not prepared to commit to carbon neutrality till , rather than the  target which other states and the UN want. Only as an analogy,this were Holyrood and Westminster, the latter could legislate to require our carbon neutrality by whatever date it decided appropriate.Thus, it is not enough to point to inter-dependence, but we need to explore the power relationship between the parties to understand how it is managed. At COP, pressure will be applied to Indiato fall into line, but nominally they are not only states, but sovereign states with the power to walk awaythe agreement on offer is overly contrary to their interests. Scotlandrsquos current constitutional position means we cannot resist the intentions of Westminster.Concealment behind warm words such as ldquointer-dependence and ldquoco-operation, cannot be allowed to conceal this substantial and signicant power dference, and the consequences thereof. Mr Wilsonrsquos approach is at best inadequate and naiumlve.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.A FAILURE OF DEMOCRACYTOM Gordon is correct to point out the obvious: Scotland has no power, autonomy or leverage within the UK . Holyrood has a pro-independence majority but its electoral mandate is not recognised in the same way as lesser electoral mandates in other parts of the UK. This should not be a cause for unionist celebration, but is actually a failure of democracy, which can only lead us, blindfold, to an uncertain future.The next steps are fairly predictable. The SNP leadership will have to pursue its goal of a referendum or lose credibility vetoed by the Tories SNP MPs pulled out of Westminster. It is what happens next that is the problem, as the UK has been through this before in Ireland. When minorities are constitutionally impotent because rules are not applied unormly, and the ballot box cannot bring change, that should be a concern for us all, and journalists should be asking pertinent questions to those who exercise power.GR Weir, Ochiltree.A LIFELINE TO THE VULNERABLETHE recently published Social Security Scotland report for   clearly indicated that the morals and ethos of the service have been achieved: fairness, dignity and respect. Most service usersreported having had a positive experience, with % reporting they had been treated with kindness.Social Security Scotland is administering  benefits, seven of which are brand new, supporting those with complex needs, disabilities, carers, and the game-changing attack on child poverty with the new Scottish Child Payment, the only place in the UK to introduce such a benefit. This payment of pound per week for each eligible child will be doubled in the letime of this parliament, a clear demonstration of the determination of the Scottish Government to tackle child poverty head on. Perhaps a copy of this report could be sent to Rishi Sunak amidst the recent and most damaging cut to welfare since the Second World War, and just for good practice a copy to the Department of Work and Pensions.Social security is something no one wants to claim, however should the need arrive, the service must provide and be the safety net it is designed to be. This encouraging report from Social Security Scotland has come about in the midst of a global pandemic, when demand for the service has been stretched, when Social Security Scotland staff were working remotely from home in many cases, indicating we have much to thank them for. They have been a leline to so many of the most vulnerable in our society.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk.CLASS DIVISION HARMS OUR PROSPECTSDOUG Maughancriticised the nature of the British political class and stated that we need \"fewer Oxford elitists and many more practical, numerate doers\". I say \"Amen\" to that. His remarks reminded me of the observation of Corelli Barnett, the historian, when he said that the ruling class in this country was made up of \"essay writers rather than problem solvers hellip an elite aloof from the ferocious struggle for survival going on in the worldrsquos marketplace more at home in a club or senior common room than a factory\".The continued existence of an educational system that is ided by class has been deeply harmful to the prospects of creating a country properly geared to meet the many challenges, economic and otherwise, constantly posed in the modern world.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.RECYCLED FRUSTRATIONI PREFACE my remarks by stating I am fully supportive of the rights of workers to withdraw their labour and to go on strike. Now my beef.Having recently moved into a new home, my visits to the Glasgow City Council Dawsholm Recycling Facility have been frequent and despite facing the Spanish Inquisition on entry , this elderly, obviously somewhat incapacitated recycler has been allowed unaided to dispose of permitted items in the appropriate receptacles the system worked.Late last week, it was dferent:  or so pickets were symbolically arranged in front of the main locked gates the entrance to the public part of the site was locked but unguarded. The net result of this was that disgruntled members of the general public, rather than ing home with a car-load of rubbish, simply dumped it in the street against the gates.First, I fail to see how a demonstration by striking workers in a cul-de-sac has any point or achieves anything. Secondly, why is a publicly-owned facility which normally appears towith little obvious input from council staff closed, one assumes by strikers ndash or is it closed by the management on grounds of \"health and safety\"  Could an admin guy not ask the pointless residency question  Thirdly, why are the only people suffering the consequences of the strike the general public and specically in the case of Dawsholm those iniduals attempting to help rather than hinder keeping the city litter-free David J Crawford, Glasgow."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13179152.jpg?type=article-full","title":"patrick-thistles-zak-rudden-outmuscles-kilmarnock-stunning-display","story":"Instead of seeking out one opponent for special punishment, the Thistle forward opted to take on the entire Kilmarnock back four.In stunning first-half display, the -year-oldembarrassed Killiersquos two centre-backs with impudent flicks, one of which led the opening, and winning, goal at Rugby Park within three minutes.

A victory against Scotland will be crucial in the context of the next World Cup.Scotland and South Africa will meet in the Pool B fixture on  September  in Marseilles. The Boks havenrsquot lost to Scotland since , and have never lost to them at a World Cup tournament.Unless Scotland complete an upset this Saturday, the Boks will go into that World Cup meeting as favourites.Not that Nienaber and company will underestimate Scotland at Murrayfield. It wasnrsquot long ago when several Scotland players represented the British  Irish Lions in South Africa.Finn Russell caused problems for the Boks when he came off the bench in the third Test in Cape Town. While the Boks boast the best defensive system in the world, there is a healthy appreciation in the South African camp for what the Scots can do on attack.With all of this in mind, it wouldnrsquot surprise to see Nienaber picking his strongest available side for the mission to Murrayfield.The Boks are already without a host of injured players ndash World Cup-winners Faf de Klerk, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Cheslin Kolbe, and Frans Malherbe ndash and it remains to be seen whether Srsquobu Nkosi, who missed the Wales clash due to visa problems, will feature. Because of these absences, they have been forced to field second- or third-choice players and to experiment with new combinations.Even without several of their stars, the Boks made a powerful statement to claim a - win against Wales ndash their first in Cardf since . While it took some time to adapt to the wet conditions at the Principality Stadium, the South Africans dominated for much of the contest in areas like the scrum and maul. Had they been more accurate, they may have won by a greater margin.ldquoThere were plenty of opportunities, but the accuracy was lacking, Nienaber said afterwards.ldquoOur discipline was poor in the first half, and we did well to recty that in the second. We didnrsquot use enough of our chances when we entered their , but I felt that our conversion rate improved later in the game.ldquoIt was good to get this win under the belt, but we have a lot to work on before the next game.Trevor Nyakane was the only injury concern in the wake of the victory against Wales. If the tighthead prop fails to recover, one would expect the versatile Thomas du Toit to come into the match .Nienaber may be tempted to rotate his halfbacks this Saturday. Herschel Jantjies struggled to adapt to the wet conditions at the Principality Stadium last week, while Cobus Reinach delivered a more assured performance when he entered the fray after  minutes.Handreacute Pollard has been an outstanding servant for the Boks, and remains the teamrsquos first-choice flyhalf and vice-captain. That said, Nienaber has to give Pollards understudy, Elton Jantjies, a start at some point on this tour.The selection of the back three should be particularly interesting. Wales peppered the likes of Jesse Kriel with high balls last week. Kriel, a specialist outside centre, was asked to plug a gap on the right wing in the absence of Kolbe and Nkosi, and did so with mixed success.Damian Willemse was forced to leave the field for an HIA in the th minute, and didnrsquot . In his absence, double-World Cup winner Frans Steyn produced an influential performance. Afterwards, the -year-old utility back admitted that he was playing every Test asit was his last.If Willemse is cleared, one would expect him to receive another opportunity. This is an important selection with a view to , as the ageing Steyn as well as Willie le Roux ndash who was rested against Wales ndash are unlikely to push on to the next World Cup. The Boks also have an exciting young prospect in Aphelele Fassi, who will be unleashed at some point on this tour.It took more than a half of rugby for the Boks to adapt to the conditions as well as the refereersquos interpretations last week. This fact may encourage Nienaber to make relatively few changes ahead of the game against Scotland .

It is understood that at least one class within every year group except P is affected by the spread.The two authorities confirmed, this Thursday evening, that any decision to shut the school would be a collective one — but it has not yet reached that point. The only caveat to this is in the eventuality that staff numbers are so depleted, the council has no option but to close Papdale, or reduce teaching hours.As of early this afternoon, only two members of staff have been confirmed to have the virus.In a statement this evening, OIC#s executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, said: “The school remains open, and the situation is being managed and monitored with the advice and guidance of NHS Orkney Public Health.“Our aim is to keep the school open as long as possible to provide learning for those pupils who are well.

Parents with children attending the school have been urged to undertake twice-weekly lateral flow testing on both themselves and their little ones.Of the  pupils at the school,  pupils were absent on Thursday from the school — a drop from  on Wednesday. According to OIC, the reason many of these pupils remained at home was due to the COVID- situation —  whether for the purpose self-isolating, or because they are symptomatic and awaiting a PCR test. A small number of parents have also chosen not to send their child children to school.Warn and inform letters have now been sent to the parents and carers of children in all affected classes within P, P, P, P, P and P, in line with Scottish Government and Public Health guidance.In addition, Papdale#s head teacher, Wendy Bowen, has written to all parents to reassure that all necessary mitigating steps are being taken.Across Orkney, a total of  new positive cases have been reported in today#s daily figures.According to NHS Orkney, these cases are a mixture of household contacts, travel and working environment contacts amongst others. The health authority has has said that this continued rise in cases is not unexpected.NHS Orkney consultant of public health, Sara Lewis said: “We are continuing to see cases riseand this is another day of high case numbers for Orkney, but we want to reassure the community that we are managing these cases.#Although, we do ask that you continue to follow the guidance in place, ensuring good ventilationindoors, washing hands, wearing face coverings and keeping a safe distance from those out with your household,possible.

This change will take effect from Monday, November  until at least Wednesday, November .Infection among both pupils and staff at the school have mounted in recent days. As of this evening  pupils have been confirmed as COVID-positive, along with five members of staff. A further four members of staff have recorded positive lateral flow test results.As a result, the nursery has been forced to close entirely, while four primary classes will remain home.The classes to close from Monday to Wednesday are: PM, PE. Classes PE and PM are to close on Monday only at this time. Online learning will be offered to affected pupils.According to a statement released by OIC, this evening, the situation will remain under daily review andthe position changes, parents and staff will be updated.The remainder of classes at Papdale Primary School will be open on Monday as usual.James Wylie, OIC’s executive director of education, leisure and housing said: “Staff have been working tirelessly over the last week to try and ensure Papdale Primary and Nursery were able to remain open in full, however, this has now reached the point where it is simply no longer possible. There are several factors for this including staff reporting positive PCR test results, being contact traced by Public Health, and the supply teaching staff list having been exhausted.“We realise that this may cause childcare issues for working parents and that is partly why we will keep the closures to an absolute minimum and monitor and manage the situation on a daily basis, ensuring that the settings are able to reopen once it is safe to do so with the appropriate staffing levels in place. It is also vital that we keep our educational facilities open whenever possible for the learning of our children, who have already missed out on so much these past  months of the pandemic.“I, again, take this opportunity to thank our staff, parents and pupils for the way in which we all continue to manage these situations, which are challenging for everyone. We must all continue to do our bit to try and stem the transmission of the virus, which is undoubtedly here for some time to come. This is now about learning to manage how we live, work and learn with COVID-. Please continue to follow the guidance, which is outlined by our colleagues at NHS Orkney below.”According to NHS Orkney, around one in three people with COVID- don’t show any symptoms.The health authority believes it is more important than ever to take your two free COVID lateral flow tests every week and record your results, evenyou are fully vaccinated and don#t have symptoms.Lateral flow test kits can be collected from community pharmacies and local test sites or ordered online at nhsinform.scot testing.  You can access the direct link to order LFD tests here: https:www.gov.uk order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flowRecording both positive and negative results allows NHS Orkney Public Health to track the presence of the virus in our communities.Find out more at nhsinform.scot testingIf you, or anyone in your household is displaying symptoms of COVID, or you have a positive lateral flow testyou must self-isolate immediately and book a PCR test in Orkney by calling  .A reminder of the ways we stay safe and protect ourselves and others against COVID are:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

According to authorities, many stayed hone due to a iety of COVID-related reasons, such as self-isolation or because they were symptomatic and awaiting a PCR test.A small number of parents have also chosen not to send their child children to school.James Wylie, OIC’s executive director of education, leisure and housing said: “Following advice from our colleagues at NHS Orkney Public Health during an inter-disciplinary meeting today, Friday, the joint decision was made to an agreed set of enhanced mitigating measures at Papdale Primary School.“The situation is being managed and monitored with the advice and guidance of Public Health for which we are very grateful.“It is important for schools to remain open while it is deemed safe by all to do so. We will continue to work with our colleagues at Public Health evaluating the numbers and should it reach a point whereby it is felt necessary for a partial or full closure, then that decision will be made collectively.“I, again, thank everyone for continuing to answer our plea for children who are well and not displaying any COVID symptoms to still attend at school as this is vital for their education and social well-being.”Targeted “warn and inform letters” have been sent to parents of children in the affected classes. Papdale head teacher, Wendy Bowen, has also written to all parents to reassure that all necessary mitigating steps are being taken.Meanwhile NHS Orkney are continuing to report double figure numbers of cases across the county on a daily basis.According to the health authority, these cases are a mixture of household contacts, travel and working environment contacts amongst others. As was mentioned last week, they were expecting to see numbers of cases continue to be high in coming days.NHS Orkney consultant of public health, Sara Lewis said: “Papdale Primary School remains open, but we have agreed an enhanced set of measures not only to reassure parents, pupils, staff and the wider community, but also to ensure we are doing all we can to keep on top of the situation. Schools do remain an area of typically low transmission and a safe place for children.“We ask that you continue to follow the guidance in place, ensuring good ventilationindoors, washing hands, wearing face coverings and keeping a safe distance from those out with your household,possible.”If you develop COVID symptoms, however mild, oryou have a positive lateral flow test, you must immediately self-isolate with your household and book a PCR test.

Enforcement of these rules is often lax.Rules on whether schoolchildren must wear masks in class y from state to state.Free rapid tests for all were scrapped nearly a month ago in an effort to incentivise more people to get vaccinated.There are now widespread calls for them to be reintroduced.

We look forward to the future discussions on behalf of Shinty within the city affording Scotland’s first sport a facility befitting the cultural importance of our traditional sport.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3_Catriona-and-Ian-Cameron-11-Fasach_Borrodale-Primary-1950s-c.-1954.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais time and our moving wells of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIt brings to our mind’s eye some of our earliest memories of community connections.My earliest memories of Halloween relate to two dferent social experiences revealing dferent relationships that I will deal with separately.Firstly, particularly vivid are my memories of the Halloween parties we had in Borrodale Primary School.Sometimes these parties would involve a wee ‘house cèilidh’ of performances at the school, with family and friends invited to visit the fun.As the occasion drew near, we would spend time away from regular lessons and prepare for our party by reorganising the classroom: carving out swedes for our lanterns , setting out stalls for spooky games and tricks, and of course for dunking or ‘dooking’ for apples. is a short play, where two girls are on their guising visits and to their surprise find themselves in a witch’s house.Borrodale school was built at some point after the  Education Act , conforming to the same model as those found throughout the country from that time, to ying degrees of similarity and size.There were three of those schools in Glendale, to encompass the ‘tuath’ or ‘munntir Gleann Dail’, with those in Borreraig and Colbost closing long before Borrodale.For a period, these schools were central to our childhood connections and friendships within the communities, many of which had effectively spanned across generations, following in the footsteps of parents, grandparents, even great-grandparents.included.During my own time in Borrodale , and that of my siblings, like generations of family before us, we walked between Borrodale and our home in Fàsach many times.And now, like in the time of our great-grandfather, again the school is no more. I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211103_133201-scaled.jpg","title":"climate action group to hold skye bridge march and vigil in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, which formed shortly before the pandemic, is inviting people to show their solidarity with activists across the world in highlighting the need for urgent change to tackle the existential threat of climate change.Speaking to the Free Press during the first week of the COP UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Skye Climate Action coordinator Anne MacLennan described the summit as “critically important” and was keen to emphasise that Saturday’s event should take place in a peaceful and respectable manner.#Saturday is the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, and the themes are that we need to act, and act urgently, and there is also the huge justice issue,# she said.“The idea for the march is for us to leave the Kyleakin-end at  noon and to walk over the bridge by the pavements and walk back again.#It is really important that the event is peaceful, family-friendly, and respectful of everyone # I think it is a demonstration of the kind of society we want to head towards being, so we can live in a sustainable and equitable way. Issues of climate, bioersity, equity are all interconnected.She added: “I think it is more powerfulit is a peaceful walk.#Giving her views on the progress being made at the COP, she added: “There are some really hard-hitting things being said, so I hope the issues are getting through to people. It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

The figures have led to one MLA to call for urgent action on the issue from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey.Figures provided by Stormont#s Department for Communitiesshow that a total of  social housing schemes have been delayed due to the pandemic, amounting to some , housing units.Delays to these schemes range anywhere from one month to  months.SDLP housing spokesperson Mark H Durkan said people are fed up with excuses and, where there are problems, we need to find solutions and get on with a program of building social and affordable housing to tackle the North’s housing crisis.“We need Sinn Fein Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey to produce a proper plan to get to grip with these issues and we need housing outcomes made a key priority in the Executive’s Programme for Government, he said.“We have thousands of people on social housing waiting lists and in housing stress, rents are increasing rapidly across the North and young people are struggling to get on the housing ladder because they can’t afford a deposit. There can be no more dither or delay on this issue, people need homes and they need them now.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Ulster Unionist communities spokesperson Andy Allen said, with around , households here on the housing waiting lists, Ms Hargey must do all she can to support the timely delivery of new homes.Understandably the pandemic and the measures taken impacted the ability of Housing Associations to deliver their housing development schemes as originally intended, he added.We urgently need to drastically increase the number of homes being delivered each year to meet the spiralling demand.Northern Ireland is in the midst of a housing crisis that will require robust and timely solutions to tackle.I would therefore call on the Minister to provide an update on the proposals announced a year ago to transform the Housing Executive to enable them to assist in building more homes.DfC said: “The Housing Executive is responsible for the delivery of the Social Housing Development Programme. The pandemic has presented challenges to all of society including the social housing and construction sectors. The Housing Executive routinely works closely with housing associations to encourage and facilitate delivery against programmed development timescales as far as possible, and will continue to focus on delivery through this challenging period.To ensure that we protect the delivery of new social housebuilding programmes, Minister Hargey recently approved additional support available to Housing Associations who are working with the construction sector to build new homes. This is to take account of the unprecedented upsurge in material costs so there is no adverse effect on the number of new social homes delivered this year.”Earlier this year, data compiled by the Belfastshowed that it will take around two decades for Northern Ireland#s housing waiting list to be addressed at the current speed that new housing units are being built.According to figures released by DfC , social housing units were completed in the last three years.Data compiled by the Belfastshows housing associations plan to start work on , units over the next three years.Related topicsMark H.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy. “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Governments from across the world are currently attending the conference on climate change in Glasgow with the aim of seeing what can be done to halt global warming. googletag.cmd.push Activists from all over are making sure their political leaders are being held to account and Derry is no dferent with the North West Climate Coalition making their voices heard prior to Saturdays Global Day of Action march in the city. People Before Profit Counicllor, Maeve ONeill – who is also a member of the North West Climate Coalition – said: “Previous Climate Conferences of world leaders has gotten us no where near to taking proper action on the climate crisis. “It is nothing more than a greenwashing opportunity for those in power. “Real change will come from the organising and mass mobilisation of millions of people across this world. “This is people power and its the most effective tool we have in making the transformative change we need.” Ms ONeills fellow People Before Profit Councillor, Shaun Harkin, said that while the parties in the Stormont Executive have been saying all the right things about climate change, their talk has yet to be matched by positive action. He added: “Over the past week, every local mainstream party has paraded its commitment to the environment. “They have all sent representatives to Glasgow to give interviews in an effort to associate themselves with calls for drastic action to save the world. They were just as unanimous back in  in voting at the Assembly for a public inquiry into how more than a million tonnes of toxic waste was dumped on Derry’s doorstep. “But there’s been no public inquiry. The toxic waste still festers there, with nobody held responsible. “Now that the environment is top of the news agenda, they are all out presenting their counterfeit credentials as fighters against the creation of waste and pollution of the land. “The only thing the establishment parties are serious about recycling is empty rhetoric.” The Global Day of Action takes place on Saturday, November  at pm in Waterloo Place, Derry.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Eighty-eight-year-old Jims career as a postmaster has gone from strength to strength. Jim first took on Carlisle Road Post Office in  after a friend of his announced his retirement and askedhe was interested in taking over. googletag.cmd.push After re-organising the post office and discovering how much he enjoyed the work, he then took on Park Avenue Post Office after its Postmaster also retired. After a third local postmaster retired – this time on Buncrana Road – Jim decided to once again take on a branch because he liked it so much. His service has spanned some of the most turbulent periods Northern Ireland has faced. Serving these communities during the height of the Troubles, Jim said he became the most robbed postmaster in the UK but he continued running his branches through a combination of “stubbornness and great staff”. Besides supporting the community through the Troubles, Jim’s branches were also a leline through the Covid- pandemic. Although the initial impact of the pandemic saw footfall sharply fall, Jim said that with the right precautions in place his customers gradually ed. Jim has lived in Derry his entire le and at the age of  has decided that it is now time “to hang up the date stamp”. Reflecting on the evolution of Post Office, Jim remarked how it has “changed drastically over the years” with the “introduction of computers, online business, emails”. In particular, he noted that post offices increasingly now act on behalf on many banks in supporting customers to withdraw and deposit their cash. Above all, Jim reflected on the people he has both worked alongside and served. He gave credit to those he worked with over his four decades of services, noting “I was lucky to have first class people about me. Without them I would not have remained”. He also admitted that, at one point, he may have known as many as half the people in Derry because he ran three dferent branches and enjoyed talking to people from the local communities so much. His branches in particular served and supported many elderly people and pensioners. The excellent service his work partners provided led to an increase in the number of elderly customers because “we all went beyond the call of duty to give a good service” – and this was particularly true during the pandemic. Local Post Office Area Manager, Sean Docherty, has his own personal connection to both Jim and the post office. Mr Docherty said: “The Branch has a history for me also as I started my career at the age of  in the branch over  years ago and its very near my family home, so it has a real special meaning to me. “Jim and his daughter Geraldine are widely known and very well respected within the city for their tireless dedication, commitment and service to their local community all throughout the Troubles and beyond. I wish Jim all the very best and well deserved retirement and long health for the future.” A framed long service leavers’ commemoration letter from Post Office Chief Executive Nick Read was presented by Post Office Network Provision Lead Janese Sung along to Jim with gt vouchers and a pen to thank him for his loyal service. A bouquet of flowers was also presented to his daughter Geraldine. Jim’s daughter, Geraldine, took over in the day-to-day running of Buncrana Road Post Office some  years ago. Buncrana Road Post Office has shared its space with Centra, one of Northern Ireland’s leading convenience stores, for the last  years and Jim has now passed the baton to Centra to continue running the post office.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Lyra, a film celebrating her le will be premiered at both the Belfast and Cork Film FestivalsReporter: Matthew Leslie Nov Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, “She loved Derry,” says film-maker Alison Millar on her friend Lyra McKee. “She was so happy there. She had met loads of new friends.” Journalist Lyra McKee had spent the last few months of her young le in Derry before she was shot dead on the night of April ,  while reporting on a riot that had broken out on Fanad Drive in the citys Creggan area. googletag.cmd.push She had moved to Derry from Belfast to live with her partner Sarah Canning, a nurse at Altnagelvin Hospital, and thrived during her time here. Millar added: “Derrys a really creative city so she would be meeting up with other writers, journalists and she enjoyed it. “She really loved it and really took to the city. Belfast was her home but she really settled into Derry. Lyra hadnt been there very long but she loved living in Derry.” Millars film on her friend, simply titled “Lyra”, will be premiered on Sunday evening simultaneously at the Belfast and Cork Film Festivals respectively. This will be the latest in a long line of acclaimed work for Millar who herself has had IFTA, BAFTA and Prix Italia success for her documentaries. Although not yet planned for general release throughout cinemas in Ireland or even broadcast on television, Millar is hopeful that over the next year or so, many others will get to see the film. The film itself opens to window to people who only knew Lyra McKee by her written work or even by the news of her killing two years ago. Rumours aplenty had begun to generate of others planning to make a film about Lyra and Millar knew that being a close friend of McKees, she had to be the one to do it. After all, as Millar says, had anything happened to her, Lyra would be writing about Alison. Millar said: “I knew she loved my films and wrote about them. I knew that she wrote about me in her books. So I came to the conclusion thatanybody  made a film about her, I would be really fed up about it. “Because I knew her family and her partner Sarah and I knew they wanted me to make a film with their help – and they helped me hugely. “I had a team of people who all knew her as well. I knew thatanything had happened to us, Lyra would be writing about us so we just knew we had to do it. It wasnt even like will we or will we not, we had to it because we wanted people to know more about her and her work. “The film was more like a way of trying to get people to know Lyra more. She had already at such a young age just achieved so much and her work was so astonishing that it could not be not talked about. We wanted to give her that voice and thats what we wanted to achieve. “We also wanted to let people know what Lyra was like as a person. She would have given – in fact Ive seen her do this – someone her last five pounds. She had even given people her coatshe saw somebody cold. “She was one of those people who would meet somebody  and talk to them for ages, askingthey were OK,they needed food orthey were cold, where are they staying are they alright. Lyra was literally that person who wouldnt pass people by. “One example of her work was a story she covered about a guy who set himself on fire at Belfasts City Hall. That was a story that she what had happened but wondered why he did that so she set out to try and find out what could have led someone to that horrible place where they felt they had to do that. “She really was that voice for the under-represented and she wanted to make sure that people were treated better and listened to what they had to say. That compassion and real love of people and le was Lyra – and people loved her back. She was very disarming with that great laugh and smile. It was her charm that got her the big interviews. “When she was , she went on a big trip to Canada to attend a conference andAlicia Keys was one of the speakers. The only person or journalist to get an interview with Alicia Keys at that conference was Lyra McKee. “She decided she wanted to speak to Alicia Keys so she made it through the crowds and the barriers and just said to her, my names Lyra McKee and Id love to interview you. And Alicia replied, Of course – no problem.” Miller and McKee had been friends since they first met when Lyra was . What impressed her about McKee was her compassion and ability to relate to people who were cast aside by society and make sure that the voice of the under-represented would be heard loud and clear. She added: “I first met Lyra when she was . Id known her a long time and I was actually due to have dinner with her the next night at my house whenever I got the message that she had been killed. “I had watched both her and her career grow and she was literally flying. She was amazing – she had just signed a two-book deal with Faber, done the TED talks the year before and she was at the top of her game. Everything was there, sitting waiting for her. She had achieved so much. “She was very compassionate. One of those people who cared deeply about people and giving them a voice. She loved to represent the under-represented. “She came from a wee house in north Belfast, brought up by her mum, her sister and her family. When Lyra was a young girl, she had hearing dficulties that made her speech dficult so she started reading books. Her granny used to buy her Harry Potter books, her sister would buy her The Twits by Roald Dahl and she got submerged in books and writing. “She was writing from an early age as it was her space – her happy place. She actually wrote a lot of poetry when she was a young girl. She wanted to be a poet for a while. “Lyra had just won the Sky Young Journalist of the Year award when I met her. She was  but when I met her I thought she was  as she had this wee baby face that meant she never looked her age. “It used to really annoy her that we would go out for a drink – even when she was in her twenties – and she was always asked to produce ID at the door. “I loved her writing – it was really beautul and descriptive and she looked for voices in her community and to break stories for people she felt hadnt been listened to or heard properly. “From a young age,she saw something and she wanted to do it she did. She always said that brick walls were not there to keep you out. But depending on how much you want something, youve got to work out how to get over them. “We want Lyra’s work to live on, we want her writing to live on, we want her voice to live on. She’s a great character, and what we really want is for people to come and spend some time with her through this film.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Cllr Harkin, who represents the Foyleside ward, was speaking after Saturdays Global Day of Action rally in Derry where many turned out to march – in unison with other world cities – to send a message to politicians that too little is being done to halt climate change. googletag.cmd.push Many figures from the Executive parties in Stormont have commented on how environmental changes need to be enforced to curb rising temperatures that could have a disastrous effect on the world with many land area at risk of being submerged by rising sea levels. However, Harkin claims such talk is nothing more than hot air and that politicians need to make good on their words with action. He said: “We commend all those who joined climate action now rallies in Derry and Belfast, across Ireland and across the world yesterday. “It was a powerful global day of action in defiance of the superficial proposals of elites gathered in Glasgow at COP. “All five of the Stormont Executive parties ran to the exclusionary Glasgow conference to join the political establishment in an attempt to showcase their newly found environmental credentials. “As Greta Thunberg said its been more blah blah blah from elites. “Rather than acting as a protector, the Executive has spent the last two decades doing immense damage to our environment. “What the Stormont Executive parties say and do is very dferent. “Just months ago the SDLP Minister for Infrastructure rammed through continued corporate gouging of Lough Neagh over the opposition of environmental campaigners. “The entire Executive allowed the DUP to run riot with the climate destroying going for growth agribusiness strategy for over a decade. “Sinn Feacutein and others said nothing because profits were high and it was good for elites. The same inaction is true for the RHI cash for ash debacle. “The same action gap is clear when it comes expanding rail and public transportation. “The lack of urgency from the DfI Minister means it could be a decade before the Derry rail upgrade happens –at all. And there are constant threats to slash funding for public transportation in order to open it up to privatisation. “The same inaction applies to cleaning up the toxic Mobuoy dump, air quality and toxic mining in the Sperrins. “There are real solutions to address the climate crisis. This requires challenging capitalisms drive for profit no matter what the consequences are for communities and nature. “The political establishment in the Stormont Executive, the Daacuteil and Westminster are not up for this because it means challenging elites, challenging inequality and challenging the status quo. “If Stormont manages to finally pass a Climate Act, the Executive cannot be trusted to ensure even its limited goals will be acted on. “We need a real alternative to the bluff and bluster of the Stormont Executive parties. People power is the key to seeing real action on climate change that can deliver a green transition protecting workers and making sure no one is left behind.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.     Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Finn Harps  Derry City   There was huge drama at Finn Park as Jamie McGonigle’s late penalty saved Derry City from defeat in a dramatic finale in the Northwest derby. It looked asthe Candystripes were headed to defeat when Ethan Boyle headed Harps into the lead with just  minutes remaining, but McGonigle kept his nerve when presented with a penalty just  minutes later. googletag.cmd.push The point does not help either side, with Harps still in relegation trouble, while City have just won one game in their last six. The first hour gave no hint of the late drama to come. It was all Harps in the early stages, and Babatunde Owolabi could have opened the scoring within two minutes as he shrugged off Cameron McJannet before bearing down on goal and shooting high into the side netting. Harps were only encouraged by that and minutes later Nathan Gartside had to be alert to push away a volley from Ethan Boyle, who tried his luck from  yards as the Derry defence stood off. It took Derry City  minutes to have a shot of any sort at Mark McGinley in the Harps goal, but Ciaron Harkin’s effort from  yards rolled harmlessly wide without bothering the Harps goalkeeper. There was simply nothing between the sides as the game went on but Derry City should have nicked it on  minutes. Harps lost possession in midfield and James Akintunde flicked the ball over the defence to put substitute Jamie McGonigle in on goal. The striker was one on one with Mark McGinley but lobbed it over the goalkeeper and the open goal and the chance was gone. That proved to be costly for Derry as Harps went down the other end and scored within  seconds. Ryan Connolly delivered a free kick into the heart of the City penalty area and it was met by Ethan Boyle who powered a header past Gartside into the net. Harps’ jubilation was cut abruptly short within a minute however as Boyle went from hero to villain as he was adjudged to have handled Jamie McGonigle’s cross and referee Ben Connolly pointed to the penalty spot. It was McGonigle who stepped up and he sent McGonigle the wrong way to score a vital equaliser for Derry City.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Greenlough vs. Steelstown Brian Og’s Ballymaguigan, pm Referee – Gregory McWilliams  , ,  and now  – No one knows just what a Steelstown victory would mean today more than Marty Dunne. The veteran goalkeeper has been there through it all over the years, the joy and excitement of reaching Intermediate finals paling in comparison to the pain of losing them, and often in such cruel circumstances. googletag.cmd.push Dunne could only watch on as Paddy Henry’s effort  seconds from the end, won the game for Castledawson at Celtic Park in . He had to wait another six years for a second chance, only for Castledawson to defeat them by a single point again, this time at Owenbeg. Whilst not as dramatic as Henry’s winner, the loss of a last minute Steelstown free kick, due to Mickey McKinney lashing out at Niall Keenan, saw the opportunity for a replay lost, and Steelstown bodies crashed to the ground in dismay at the final whistle. Four years later and it seemed it might finally be Steelstown’s year – they held a good lead against Greenlough at Bellaghy, but they let it slip, and an error by Dunne himself led to a goal for Michael McDonnell in added time. There was no way back. So, in , Steelstown still await their first title, and Dunne, still going strong at , has one more chance to get his hands on a trophy that has eluded his grasp for over a decade. This will be his fth final - fourth Intermediate, one junior - and he knows just how fortunate he is to get another opportunity. “Its one thing you understand when you get older you appreciate them more and you look forward to them,” he said. “You know they are not going to come around all the time. When you’re younger you think ‘we’ll get plenty of these’, but you realise how sparse they are now so it’s good to be in it again and get another chance at it. “We would have killed to be back in this position after last year. A lot of teams could just fade away after something like that and not get back up there again, so we’re lucky in that regard in that we’re straight back where we want to be and we can have another rattle at them.” Last year’s final is still fresh in his mind, and it is he who brings up his short kick-out which led to that late McMullan goal. That is a regret, but he doesn’t lose sleep over it. “These things happen in matches,” he acknowledged. “All you can do is try and put it right again. Once it’s done it’s done. You are a goalkeeper and you’re going to make these mistakes, so these things are going to happen, especially in the heat of a final when you’re trying to rush things and trying to do things. It will not be in my head anyway, that’s for sure. “We were up by three points I think going into the final quarter and we never really kicked on. We kind of sat back and we never pushed on to get that result. You always think you should have won it and my contribution at the end didn’t help. These things happen so I’m looking forward to getting a second chance at it.”  Weight of history Everyone knows by now that Steelstown are still without that elusive first title, but Dunne, who has every right to feel that the club deserves one by now, does not believe that the weight of history should be a factor this weekend. “The first one is always the hardest to get over the line, but it’s a dferent group of players,” he explained. “I don’t think the young boys will be too concerned about that, it’s still just one match against Greenlough who are a good side and it will be hard to win. You would like to experience getting over finals, but the only way you can do that is by winning your first one.” It is impossible not to notice the progress made at Steelstown over recent years- from their senior ladies, to their reserves, to their underage work – the club is synonymous with success in so many ways. Dunne has enjoyed being a part of that, but he knows from the grassroots up to senior, nothing can ever be taken for granted “There’s been ups and downs but you always think it’s going to be a straight line up,” he reflected. “Going into senior was brilliant even though we didn’t win Intermediate, we stepped into senior and that was good, getting a run at senior. I wish we had stayed there, it’s disappointing to be back down in Intermediate, because we could have stayed on there. “This group of players are good enough for senior and that’s where they need to be. In the long term that’s what those guys need. “You always want the trajectory heading up the ways and that’s the next step but you want to win a championship. That’s the point. If we were to get that it would definitely help that group of players push on. It seems that every time Steelstown are in a final it’s a young team, but we probably have a better balance than we ever had there’s plenty of older heads there and younger boys spread throughout the team.” Hugh McGrath’s team were very impressive in Sunday’s semi-final win over the Limavady Wolfhounds. The -, - victory was borne from slick and clinical attacking play and the game was over as a contest by the half time break. Steelstown are going into the final with great momentum. “We made a good start, pegging on the scores and keeping the pressure on,” Dunne agrees. “There was a wide range of scorers so we weren’t relying on one or two scorers. It was good to get it over the line with a decent performance, but obviously Greenlough is going to be a step up again, we’re under no illusions about that. Our heads are pretty level one thing about this group is that they won’t get ahead of themselves in any regard. “We have to go at them and take them on, and get the scores on the board and be confident. We did that in the final against them last year but then we dried up and didn’t really push on, and we sat back a bit which isn’t really our style. You can’t throw away -point leads or -pount leads, you just can’t do it because you can’t stop momentum thenit turns against you. You have to keep pushing on.”  The future Dunne had decided to retire two years ago, but he was convinced by Eamon Gibson tolast year, and as  comes to an end he is still the main man for Steelstown. He knows by now not to look too far ahead, but he would dearly love to get that trophy in his hands before that final game comes. What a fairytale ending that would be for a terric club servant. “I’ll not look beyond Saturday’s match and see how it pans out from there,” he said. “Things could be very dferent depending on the dferent outcomes, so I haven’t given too much thought to it. “That’s why you keep going, because you want to win something. There’s plenty of people out there who don’t even get the chance to get to a final, plenty of players who have played for a lot longer than me and haven’t had much to show for it. As much as you can look back and say it’s disappointing not to win, at least you have got this one more chance, and that’s all you can ever have, that one chance every year, so take it, and I’m just looking forward to that.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Institute  Dergview  It was another opportunity missed for Institute as they could only draw with Dergview at the Brandywell. It is now seven games without a win for ‘Stute who overcame a half time deficit, but despite some good chances, could not turn the game in their favour. A ‘Stute mistake gave Derview the lead early on. Goalkeeper John Connolly yelled for his defender to leave it as Cathal Farren’s cross came in, but he dropped the ball straight into the path of the league’s top scorer Benny Igiehon, wo simply put the ball into the empty net to make it -. googletag.cmd.push It should have gotten worse for the home side on the half hour when Niall McGinley broke down the left, and he picked out Farren in the middle, but the former Derry City striker scuffed his effort wide of the target with just Connolly to beat. The home side were thrown a leline just before the hour mark when they were awarded a penalty. A cross into the Dergview box found Aaron McGurk, whose touch took the ball away from him. Both McLaughlin and goalkeeper Buchanan went for the loose ball and it looked asthe goalkeeper got there first, but not according to referee Harrigan, who pointed to the spot. Dergview were baffled by the decision, but after their protests, McLaughlin kept his calm to score his first goal in  games and his th for the season overall to make it -. ‘Stute had a great chance to take the lead in the game for the first time on  minutes when McGurk did well to work his way into the area, and although his shot was blocked, the ball fell out of the sky right onto the foot of McLaughlin, who volleyed wide with the whole goal to aim at. Those missed chances almost cost ‘Stute as Dergview began to get on top for the first time in the second half as the game entered the final ten minutes. Jamie Browne had his head in his hands after he dispossessed Jamie Dunne just outside his own area, but the striker was denied at the last second by the ‘Stute man, who made amends by deflecting the shot behind for a corner. From that set-piece, ‘Stute were lucky to survive as the ball bounced around the area, and it took a few brave blocks to keep the ball from reaching Connolly’s goal with Dergview players lining up to put it in.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Institute  Dergview  It was another opportunity missed for Institute as they could only draw with Dergview at the Brandywell. It is now seven games without a win for ‘Stute who overcame a half time deficit, but despite some good chances, could not turn the game in their favour. A ‘Stute mistake gave Derview the lead early on. Goalkeeper John Connolly yelled for his defender to leave it as Cathal Farren’s cross came in, but he dropped the ball straight into the path of the league’s top scorer Benny Igiehon, wo simply put the ball into the empty net to make it -. googletag.cmd.push It should have gotten worse for the home side on the half hour when Niall McGinley broke down the left, and he picked out Farren in the middle, but the former Derry City striker scuffed his effort wide of the target with just Connolly to beat. The home side were thrown a leline just before the hour mark when they were awarded a penalty. A cross into the Dergview box found Aaron McGurk, whose touch took the ball away from him. Both McLaughlin and goalkeeper Buchanan went for the loose ball and it looked asthe goalkeeper got there first, but not according to referee Harrigan, who pointed to the spot. Dergview were baffled by the decision, but after their protests, McLaughlin kept his calm to score his first goal in  games and his th for the season overall to make it -. ‘Stute had a great chance to take the lead in the game for the first time on  minutes when McGurk did well to work his way into the area, and although his shot was blocked, the ball fell out of the sky right onto the foot of McLaughlin, who volleyed wide with the whole goal to aim at. Those missed chances almost cost ‘Stute as Dergview began to get on top for the first time in the second half as the game entered the final ten minutes. Jamie Browne had his head in his hands after he dispossessed Jamie Dunne just outside his own area, but the striker was denied at the last second by the ‘Stute man, who made amends by deflecting the shot behind for a corner. From that set-piece, ‘Stute were lucky to survive as the ball bounced around the area, and it took a few brave blocks to keep the ball from reaching Connolly’s goal with Dergview players lining up to put it in.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Michael McMullan Nov Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, Relief. That was Hugh McGrath’s take on finally getting over the line as Steelstown won their first Intermediate title at last.He admitted it wasn’t this side’s best showing of the season. Nor were they cohesive. And they didn’t play the brand of football they wanted. But there was only one currency Steelstown were dealing in. Silverware. That’s all Saturday was about.“It just matters that you are ahead at the end of the game,” said McGrath.“I wasn’t nervous in any way,” he told his side before the club’s historic hour. “I was jealous that they got to get the chance to go out and show what they were worth and show what was inside them.”And, coming back from last season’s defeat and in the manner which they did, that – in McGrath’s opinion – is the Steelstown’s calling card.“It tells you all you need to know about the group,” he said.The burden of three final defeats didn’t come into the narrative. It was a new management team, with a sprinkling of new players.At dferent times this year, McGrath beat the drum of a new beginning. Donncha Gilmore is now an All-Ireland winner. Five championships goals later, Morgan Murray has arrived on the scene and like Oran Fox, he benefitted from a league campaign that McGrath treated as gloried friendlies.It wasn’t about hard luck stories or flashbacks from yesteryear.“All we could base any chat around was what we done this year so far,” McGrath again stressed.“We were confident that we’d get ourselves in enough positions to take chances, that we’d create enough chances to get ourselves over the line.“We knew it would be tough, you don’t play the champions and get it easy. We knew it would be tough all the way through and it was about grinding it out.”Points from Jason McAleer and Eoghan Bradleyhad Steelstown three points clear after eight minutes, but the sides were levelat the break.“We weren’t panicking because we knew these things happen,” insisted the Steelstown boss. We went a couple down at the start of the second half. Maybe there was a bit of panic and you are going to feel that pressure when you have a couple of forwards like Greenlough have.”But McGrath trusted their leaders. Skipper Forester. Impact man Mickey McKinney. Midfielder Ryan Devine. All players from the  minor team he coached when he arrived at the club.“You have confidence that you have a group that will drive you on and get you over the line and that’s the way it panned out,” McGrath said.The fact they were still at the coal face of their title bid spoke volumes. McKinney was crying with total elation. “Is this real ”, bellowed Forester amid the pandemonium.“To go so long until now, it shows the type of characters that they are. They hung in there and had the belief in the group that was coming behind them,” McGrath added.“They are emotional. It shows how much the clubs means to them they have a desire to win.”And on the weekend that marked the thanniversary of Brian Oacuteg McKeever’s death. The club now carries his name.For McGrath, the final quarter told the story of the McKeever family.“That’s the way he would’ve played his game. If you look at the way Neildrove out, Eoghan Concannon hammered everything that was near him.“That was Brian Oacuteg McKeever, that’s what he did and there are plenty around here that know that’s what he did.“They were part of him, they saw him do it and the young people coming through are now aware of it too.”“He is never too far from our thoughts and Charleneas well, she played exactly the same way. For us to be able to do this for the McKeever family and give them something to celebrate, we are proud do to that.” googletag.cmd.push ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Michael McMullan Nov Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, Relief. That was Hugh McGrath’s take on finally getting over the line as Steelstown won their first Intermediate title at last.He admitted it wasn’t this side’s best showing of the season. Nor were they cohesive. And they didn’t play the brand of football they wanted. But there was only one currency Steelstown were dealing in. Silverware. That’s all Saturday was about.“It just matters that you are ahead at the end of the game,” said McGrath.“I wasn’t nervous in any way,” he told his side before the club’s historic hour. “I was jealous that they got to get the chance to go out and show what they were worth and show what was inside them.”And, coming back from last season’s defeat and in the manner which they did, that – in McGrath’s opinion – is the Steelstown’s calling card.“It tells you all you need to know about the group,” he said.The burden of three final defeats didn’t come into the narrative. It was a new management team, with a sprinkling of new players.At dferent times this year, McGrath beat the drum of a new beginning. Donncha Gilmore is now an All-Ireland winner. Five championships goals later, Morgan Murray has arrived on the scene and like Oran Fox, he benefitted from a league campaign that McGrath treated as gloried friendlies.It wasn’t about hard luck stories or flashbacks from yesteryear.“All we could base any chat around was what we done this year so far,” McGrath again stressed.“We were confident that we’d get ourselves in enough positions to take chances, that we’d create enough chances to get ourselves over the line.“We knew it would be tough, you don’t play the champions and get it easy. We knew it would be tough all the way through and it was about grinding it out.”Points from Jason McAleer and Eoghan Bradleyhad Steelstown three points clear after eight minutes, but the sides were levelat the break.“We weren’t panicking because we knew these things happen,” insisted the Steelstown boss. We went a couple down at the start of the second half. Maybe there was a bit of panic and you are going to feel that pressure when you have a couple of forwards like Greenlough have.”But McGrath trusted their leaders. Skipper Forester. Impact man Mickey McKinney. Midfielder Ryan Devine. All players from the  minor team he coached when he arrived at the club.“You have confidence that you have a group that will drive you on and get you over the line and that’s the way it panned out,” McGrath said.The fact they were still at the coal face of their title bid spoke volumes. McKinney was crying with total elation. “Is this real ”, bellowed Forester amid the pandemonium.“To go so long until now, it shows the type of characters that they are. They hung in there and had the belief in the group that was coming behind them,” McGrath added.“They are emotional. It shows how much the clubs means to them they have a desire to win.”And on the weekend that marked the thanniversary of Brian Oacuteg McKeever’s death. The club now carries his name.For McGrath, the final quarter told the story of the McKeever family.“That’s the way he would’ve played his game. If you look at the way Neildrove out, Eoghan Concannon hammered everything that was near him.“That was Brian Oacuteg McKeever, that’s what he did and there are plenty around here that know that’s what he did.“They were part of him, they saw him do it and the young people coming through are now aware of it too.”“He is never too far from our thoughts and Charleneas well, she played exactly the same way. For us to be able to do this for the McKeever family and give them something to celebrate, we are proud do to that.” googletag.cmd.push ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

I was going to talk about the NI Music Prize when the predictable happens and rant on deaf ears about the unfairness of it all, but I continually vote in it, and it has been quite spot-on in the past, so, maybe I might wise up. Probably not like. Anyway. googletag.cmd.push For those not familiar and familiar with the process Aaron Cunningham, deputy editor at Chordblossom Addison Paterson, Alastair Simpson, Andrew Lemon, The Thin Air Brendan McKeown, Mr Brian Coney, editor at The Thin Air, Chris Corrigan, head of music Queens University Belfast, Carolyn Mathers, Director of Snow Water middot Christopher McBride, Ciara McMullan, photographer Erika Clarke, Chris Flack, Colin Harper, Colum Fitzsimons, David Roy, Dan Hegarty, Davy Sims, Rachael Campbell Palmer, director Black Box, Dolores Vischer, Monk, Edwin McFee, journalist Gerry Sheppard, Hannah Anderson, Hannah Gibson, Mark Hornby, James Ayo, Robert Brown, Editor at Chordblossom middot John DArcy, Jamie Taylor, beautul Everton fan, Janis Leaden, Amy Nolan, Jimmy Devlin, Joe Dougan, Johanna Leech, Jonathan Stewart, Josh Henry, Jo Wright, Kate Barry, Keely, Keith Millar, Me, Les Hume, Lisa Flavelle, Dylan Murphy and Jack Rapanakis, Mari Jackson, Mark Millar, Brendan McGoran, Meghan Gilleece, Thee Micky Ferry, Thee Nance Hall, Nattassa Latcham, Niall Byrne, Olga Kaye, Patricia McConville, Paddy Craig, Music Peter Cinnamond, Phil McCarroll, Ralph McClean, Roisin McNickle, Rory McConnell, Ruth McCarthy, Sara Champ, Sarah Kiely, Sean Kelly, Sean McCann, Simon Oliver, Siobhan McAndrew, Stephen McCaulay of the wonderful taste, handsome Stevie Lennox, Steve Stockman, Stuart Fletcher, Stuart Bailie obviously, Geoff Topley, Thomas Camblin and Saul Duffin have decided that Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic, Arvo Party’s Inheritance, Bicep’s Isles, CATALAN!’s Veritas, Danni Larkin’s Notes For A Maiden Warrior, Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave, Jealous Of The Birds’ Peninsula, Joshua Burnside’s Into The Depths Of Hell, New Pagans’s The Seed The Vessel The Roots And All, Peter J McCauley’s Amnesty, Saint Sister’s Where I Should End, This Ship Argo’s Always The Bees Never The Honey, TRUacute’s No Fixed Abode and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won have all been nominated for the best album at the Northern Ireland Music Prize and Amy Montgomery’sIntangible, Bicep’smiddot Apricots, Cherym’sListening To My Head, Dea Matrona’sStamp On It, Enola Gay’sSofa Surfing, Invaderband’sI Wont Remember You, Jordan Adetunji’s Wokeup! and Waldorf  Cannon’sWe Are Your Governmenthave been nominated for best single at event. There hasn’t been enough gigs this past year to have a best live act, how they arrived at a conclusion last year is strange but then I may be misinformed. There’s obviously no new bands to speak of so it’s just the two awards this year. I suppose it’s as close to democracy as we can get, but as with everything in the parish, the archaic powers that be hold way too much influence and are too stuck in the past. I’m the guiltiest and have no real business having a say and will keep my opinions to myself from now on. Well after I say that to my ears Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won are the best albums on that list to me and Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government is the best single. I think we should all sit back and appreciate that Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave was recently up for the Mercury Music Prize kiss of death, sadly not winning butit was two out of two losses an outsider would be thinking that there is something really weird going on within the chambers of power up at the Oh Yeah Centre. I named the  nominators to remind myself that my taste really isn’t that important, and I should read my above statement about keeping my opinions to myself. Waiting for things to change in the parish is just something we are great at here.

I was going to talk about the NI Music Prize when the predictable happens and rant on deaf ears about the unfairness of it all, but I continually vote in it, and it has been quite spot-on in the past, so, maybe I might wise up. Probably not like.

There hasn’t been enough gigs this past year to have a best live act, how they arrived at a conclusion last year is strange but then I may be misinformed. There’s obviously no new bands to speak of so it’s just the two awards this year. I suppose it’s as close to democracy as we can get, but as with everything in the parish, the archaic powers that be hold way too much influence and are too stuck in the past. I’m the guiltiest and have no real business having a say and will keep my opinions to myself from now on. Well after I say that to my ears Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won are the best albums on that list to me and Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government is the best single. I think we should all sit back and appreciate that Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave was recently up for the Mercury Music Prize kiss of death, sadly not winning butit was two out of two losses an outsider would be thinking that there is something really weird going on within the chambers of power up at the Oh Yeah Centre. I named the  nominators to remind myself that my taste really isn’t that important, and I should read my above statement about keeping my opinions to myself. Waiting for things to change in the parish is just something we are great at here. What next, I hear you ask, well there is a group that meets around a table and weighs up the options for the best albums, I’d like to think they do this in a fair manner and once they reach a consensus then the world, who will undoubtedly be waiting with bated breath, will get their answer The same is not true for the single, that is voted for by the public, you, and that’s why those bands were urging you to vote recently.

We wanted to celebrate that and also remember our dear friend and past pupil, Sonia Kinsella, who died of cancer last year.ldquoWhen we think of her strength and her courage and more importantly, her optimism, this play seemed so appropriate. We hope it pays tribute to Sonia as I think the sentiments this play evokes were embodied in that remarkable lady.ldquoThe play celebrates the strength of female friendship and the incredible support women experience from each other. I think our audiences will find themselves laughing one minute and crying the next.I am so proud of what has been achieved not only in the fact we havenrsquot fallen out despite the dficulties you face when you are trying to work with friends but also the time these busy women have devoted to learning lines and rehearsing while working full time and coping with family responsibilities. It has been hard work but I truly feel audiences will really enjoy the performance.Proceeds from the performances will be in aid of Marie Curie and Assumption Grammar Schoolrsquos sister schools in South Africa.Marcelle said: ldquoThese schools struggle financially anyway but they are experiencing great challenges during lockdown. The money we raise will make a huge dference to many lives there, allowing girls to get access to education and to be offered a meal each day.The provision offered to these students in South Africa can make all the dference to their future.She added: It is wonderful to see the fruition of all our hard work that all stemmed from a conversation during lockdown and that will hopefully benefit others in dferent ways.To purchase a ticket the production, please contact the school reception on   .

The website is now live. It is www.redkiteretreat and we are regularly updating our Facebook page @redkiteretreat. For more information please pay us a visit on Facebook, like and share the page.Red Kites were in the area and over a year ago and Stephen started feeding them and as this continued more and more started turning up daily.Red Kites are a bird of prey and have a huge wingspan of up to . metres they are reddish brown with black wingtips and a grey head.They have a distinctive V-shaped tail which they use like a rudder as they twist and turn through the air on thermals and their call is a long whistle.Red Kites are primarily scavengers and a big part of their diet is made up of dead animals , including road-kill. They also follow tractors when ploughing and swoop down to grab any small animals that have been killed by the mowers or brought to the surface.They are no threat to livestock and the largest animal they have the power and speed to kill is a young rabbit. Red Kites, like all other birds of prey, are protected by law and to harm, disturb or kill them is a criminal offence.The new Red Kite Retreat bird hide has already become very popular with wildle photographers and bird watchers and booking a slot is essential.Three generations of the Malcomson family have also helped to plant some of the first of , native trees on a -acre site to create The Warriorrsquos Wood on Dechomet Mountain.The main contractor, Scottish Woodland Ireland Ltd, managed the forest expansion and farm ersication project and planted Irish Oak, Hazel, Holly, Scots Pine and Downy Birch. Stephen and Karen also created two new ponds to encourage wildle and sowed a new wildflower meadow.Warriorrsquos Wood is the initial habitat enhancement works which form part of the new eco-tourism development known as the lsquoRed Kite Retreatrsquo.Stephen and Karen are the projectrsquos co-founders and wanted a means of ersying their farm business to ensure future sustainability.Currently, Stephen has a pig and beef unit on the farm but said ldquofarming enterprises have to adapt and evolve to ensure sustainability for future generations of farmers. I see no reason why modern farming practices cannot go hand in hand with conservation, environmental enrichment and encouraging bioersity.The Red Kite Retreat project aims to create a unique tourist and visitor facility and focuses on conservation and education about the Red Kite bird of prey, with the creation of the Warriorrsquos Wood the first step in the project.The Wood has been designed to mimic ancient woodland with species adapted to grow in elevated and exposed locations, with the planting including Scots pine, oak, birch, aspen, rowan, hawthorn and juniper.The Scots pine is favoured by native red squirrels which it is hoped will be reintroduced once the woodland has matured, while Juniper is also being established on the site.Updates in the Red Kite retreat are available on Facebook @redkiteretreat, by logging on at www.redkiteretreat or telephone .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_espie.jpg","title":"Castle Espie receives plaudit  ","story":"THE Castle Espie Wetland Centre on the shores of Strangford Lough, which recently hosted the popular BBC wildle programme Autumnwatch, has been praised for its ongoing conservation work.Ards and North Down deputy mayor Robert Adair visited the centrersquos base recently and met BBC programme presenter Gillian Burke and Castle Espie manager Paul Stewart.Cllr Adair said after the huge success of Springwatch at Castle Espie, the television programmersquosfor Autumnwatch has shone the spotlight on the rich wildle of the borough and Castle Espie as an icon of sustainable green tourism.In addition to hosting Autumnwatch, the visit comes as the charity is currently celebrating with a Winter Migration Festival at Castle Espie which includes a series of bespoke events for adults and children alike and runs until November .Cllr Adair said the international importance of Strangford Lough and its exceptional bioersity is a real asset to the environment.ldquoCastle Espie provides a window on the lough with the Winter Migration Festival and filming of Autumnwatch being a fitting way to introduce people to this wonderful asset on our doorstep, he added.Mr Stewart said the centre has been celebrating the natural resource and theof the Brent geese with events in and around Autumnwatch aimed at connecting people with nature.ldquoFrom sunrise yoga, art workshops, walks and talks, to nature focused activities for children, they are all aimed at connecting people to this wonderful place, he explained.ldquoThe worldrsquos wetland habitats like those at Castle Espie actually sequester more carbon than all the worldrsquos forests despite occupying only a fraction of the area around the globe.ldquoAs well as helping to deal with the effects of climate change, wetlands are one of the most bioerse habitats on Earth, protect us from flooding, filter pollutants and help improve our mental health.The Wildle and Wetlands Trust works around the globe, protecting wetland habitats and migratory bird flyways and operates  wetland centres across the UK with Castle Espie the only one in Northern Ireland.The charity recently launched a new lsquoWetlands Can!rsquo campaign, urging people to get behind the leading conservation charityrsquos call for creating , hectares of healthy wetlands in the UK to help combat the climate crisis.Mr Stewart added: ldquoIf the Covid crisis has taught us one thing, itrsquos that we canrsquot go back to how things were before.

Hynds produced a peerless display aside from that concession, a former Poc Fada competitor, her restarts were struck with precision to wing forwards Katie Black and Niamh Galloway, who in turn fed team captain Joanne Sloane.Straight away, Sloane would angle deliveries into the mobile Maguire. Sloanersquos slick stickwork was impressive, and she had a fine contest versus Bernie Convery throughout.The key battle however, was the dual between Dearg centre back Grainne Glendenning and Belfastrsquos Jessica Rush.With her luminous green boots and helmet, Rush would stand out in any game, but she has the class to back up the bright colours.Winning a huge amount of primary possession, Jessica lsquos jinking, probing runs and vision to find Nicole Clerkin and Niamh Dolan was causing huge headaches for an experienced Ben Dearg defence.Kilcliefrsquos breakthrough goal came in the th minute with Burns finishing brilliantly past Lara OrsquoHare.Clare Kelly and Aacuteine Moynan made timely and brave blocks from Nora Maguirersquos goalbound efforts. The midfield battle was an intriguing and crucial one.Dual star Cara Doran has been on a scoring spree in the football championship this year and she continued her hot streak, with some exceptionally well taken scores from tight angles.Eimear Dorrian was everywhere, covering every blade of grass, never static, always roving, trying to create and make things happen. Dorrianrsquos dynamism and Doranrsquos deadliness contributed hugely to the green and reds display.Niamh McGuigan produced an equally impressive display for the Belfast side. McGuiganrsquos magnetic ability to gain possession in the tightest of spaces is remarkable.Never rushed, despite the chaos around her, she has that precarious talent of always having time, allowing her to scan and assess options, a luxury that only the very top operatorrsquos have.All season, Niamh Daly has also operated at centre field, but cruelly missed out on this final through injury.Brigid Scullion cleverly ped deep to forage for possession, picking up loose ball and linking well with half backs McErlain and Mathers. Kilclief thundered into action with another brace of points from deadly Doran.Her score in the st minute was worthy of the admission fee. Still only  years of age, a career in county colours surely beckons for this gted youngGael.Eimear Breen was a constant outlet for her defence to hit, a player who uses her pace effectively at the right times.With  minutes remaining, Kilclief were edging the contest with a five point cushion. Management Brendan Breen and Seaacuten Paul Doran madetactical tweaks to thwart the increasingly dangerous Clerkin and Dolan axis up front.A double sweeper system was swtly put in place, Cliona Shields and Catherine Deegan were tasked with shutting up shop forming a highly effective shield in front of Ballinascreen stalwart Nicole Clerkin.Nicolersquos space was greatly reduced, but still she battled as hard as possible to cut the deficit. McMullan and Mastersonrsquos masterclass in creating space for goalkeeper Hynds to aim towards, were signicant.McMullan typied the fight and character within the Ben Dearg outfit, as did the industrious Catherine Deegan. Yet, East Belfast pressed with an astounding intensity and relentlessness.That huge work rate comes from having dual players with fierce commitment and blocks of fitness from constant competing, but also from their Bainisteoiriacute Ciaran Hughes and Seaacuten Coulter who encourage their team to play with flair, and they certainly do that, but intense work ethic is paramountyou are to retain a place in this highly motivated team.That competition for places has ensured consistent performance levels all season.Niamh Dolan cleverly created precious space in the congested final third in the th minute, but her angled drive was superbly blocked by Cliona Shields, then swept up bravely by the heroic McMullan, who swtly transitioned to the always available Dorrian.Testament to the synchronisity that is within this Ben Dearg side, Dorrian didnrsquot have to look up to spot the expertly timed run of Burns who showed a deftness of touch to control the sliotar and sail it straight over the black spot.It was a score that comes from playing training together over many seasons. At the other end Aacuteine Moynan and Shannon McWilliams made important blocks, just as Joanne Sloan and Niamh Galloway were about to raise green flags.Clodagh Hanvey made a strong contribution after entering the fray. Maguirersquos maturity and decision making is exceptional for a Gael just turned .With Cara Doran the same age, the future is bright for this Kilclief team. Breen too, displays a shrewd tactical brain, dropping into spaces, covering runs, causing havoc.Doran was awarded player of the match, for her scintillating display, though a case could also have been made for East Belfastrsquos Niamh McGuigan.Niamhrsquos link up play with Jessica Rush was a joy to watch, but equally impressive was her willingness to help team mates in trouble, a true team player.With both teams featuring strong and dynamic forward units, this game was always going to be decided by which defence came out on top.Ultimately, the craft, guile and experience of the Kilclief reargaurd ensured that they closed the game out and got the Championship title they so craved, especially after last yearrsquos heartbreaking defeat to Attical.Euphoric scenes and emotions were unleashed as referee HP McCusker blew his final whistle.Team captain Joanne Sloane spoke from the heart, with a speech that did her club proud. A huge roar went up from the Ben Dearg support whenever she lted aloft the Liam Mac An Ri championship trophy.Each age group at juvenile and now senior level has collected silverware this season, testament to the solid work taking place at their fantastic new facilities in St Malachyrsquos Park.Lorraine MacCartanrsquos priceless contribution in the development of players at the club was highlighted, and deserved praise was duly given to this exemplary East Belfast side.The Ulster Championships now beckon for Kilclief.Referee: H P McCusker .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_kilmore.jpg","title":"Kilmore navigate their way past Maze  ","story":"KILMORE Rec welcomed Lower Maze to Robert Adams Park in the third round of the Peaky Blinders Irish Cup and produced a barn storming second half comeback to progress to round four.With Kilmore two goals down at half-time, having been harshly reduced to ten men after  minutes, the odds were stacked against them.However, a tactical change and a second half performance full of hard work and passion epitomised by man of the match Paddy Grant saw Michael Carvillrsquos men defy those odds and produce one of the most memorable comebacks seen at Robert Adams Park in recent times.Kilmore started brightly but after just eight minutes they failed to clear their lines from a corner, allowing Lower Mazersquos Alex Scott to pick up the ball  yards out and fire through a crowded goal mouth past an unsighted Chris Turley in the Kilmore goals.The task in hand got harder when the referee adjudged Kilmore captain Niall McCarthy to be the aggressor in a midfield confrontation and, to the astonishment of all in the ground, deemed it a red card offence.The injustice of the sending off galvanised Kilmorersquos ten men and they took the game to Lower Maze, dominating possession and creating chances.The first of these saw Caolan Conlon burst through from midfield. His shot was well saved and the rebound fell to Gary Kennedy who fired towards the net only to see Maze lsquokeeper Heron produce a great double save.Cai Gemmel, who was magnicent throughout, saw a goal bound effort deflected wide of the head of a Maze defender as it seemed destined for the top corner.As the chances came and went Kilmore got caught with a sucker punch in the nd minute.Bradford made his way down the left and his mis-cued cross beat a stranded Turley to leave Kilmore two down at half-time and up against it.Carvill changed the shape of the team at half-time and went with a front two of Paddy Grant and Josh Smyth.This change paid idends in the th minute when Grant weaved his way into the box, although it appeared he had been forced too wide, but the forward still managed to fire a rasping drive to the roof of the net.In the th minute a sustained period of Kilmore pressure brought the equaliser, with Grant again involved when his clipped cross was nodded in at the back post by the energetic Josh Smyth.Kilmore continued to dominate and press for the winner, as it seemed as though the game was destined for extra time.In the th minute the pressure finally paid off when Carvill whipped in a corner and that man Grant was on hand to hook the ball home from close range to send the Kilmore faithful into raptures.As Lower Maze then threw everything at Kilmore in injury time, the Blues defence of Magee, Larkin, Kennedy, Stewart and lsquokeeper Turley remained steadfast.Kilmorersquos substitutes of Dagen and Lynas had a chance each on the break for a fourth, but it wasnrsquot to be.Carvill spoke of his ldquoimmense pride in the resilience and determination shown by his side after the match.It came as no surprise that the Kilmore supporters man of the match went to Paddy Grant for his two goals and an assist in a match winning performance.This win sealed double delight for Kilmore, as the club recently secured approval for the installation of a new G football pitch, complete with floodlights, dug-outs, pitch side fencing and associated pathways.Kilmore: Turley, Smyth, Stewart, Larkin, Magee, Gemmell, Conlon, McCarthy, Kennedy, Carvil, Grant.

While Downpatrick has the Fountain Foodbank, Banbridge has a Christian ministry group called J based in the old cinema which will be supporting  families this Christmas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"McKee stands down from UUP  ","story":"MOURNES Ulster Unionist councillor Harold McKee has quit the party.The veteran politician and former South Down MLA has resigned, saying that Doug Beattiersquos leadership of the party is at odds with his religious beliefs.Cllr McKee, who will remain an independent member of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, criticised Mr Beattie for advising members to ldquoleave their Christianity at the door.His resignation comes ahead of next Mayrsquos Assembly election when his wide network of connections across the Mournes area would havebeen a key part of the UUPrsquos drive to secure a seat in South Down.Cllr McKee has confirmed that he intends to serve as an independent ldquoat this point in time with some suggesting that he could potentially be approached by the DUP to join its three councillors on the local authority.He has attacked his former party leader over his stance on abortion, same-sex marriage and a recent vote at Stormont on gay conversion therapy.ldquoIn relation to same sex marriage which Mr Beattie is keen to endorse, I cannot go against the infallible word of God that marriage is between one man and one woman, said Cllr McKee.ldquoI am saddened to observe that these views seem to be of little value in the UUP of today but, rather, a stance of celebrating left-of-centre liberalism seems to be the only acceptable viewpoint.His resignation statement said Mr Beattiersquos leadership was ldquoa far cry from the UUP roots and ldquothe party of Carson and Craig.When Mr Beattie succeeded Steve Aiken as UUP leader earlier this year, he pledged to have a dferent style that would be ldquoable to reach out to all people in Northern Ireland regardless of what your religion is, sexual orientation or ethnicity.Cllr McKee said it was ldquobecoming very dficult to endorse a leader who is constantly to the fore promoting liberal issues while conservative values were being squeezedout. A UUP spokesperson said the party was sorry that Mr McKee had decided his political future no longer lay with the UUP.ldquoWe would like to thank Harold for his service and wish him well for the future, the spokesperson said. ldquoThe party will continue to hold out the hand of friendship as Harold takes a new path.Slieve Croob Ulster Unionist councillor Alan Lewis has described the decision by his former colleague to quit as ldquodisappointing.He continued: ldquoThere are many things that I find myself disagreeing with in all parties, not just my own and sometimes I find that it is better to continue to lobby, talk through and progress these issues from the inside, rather than walk out the door.ldquoThatrsquos democratic politics. Nobody is going to call for the gallows just because your opinion dfers, no matter how rigorous the debate. Unionism demands cohesion with the avoidance of ision.Cllr Lewis also thanked his former colleague for his ldquohelp, support, wisdom and guidance since he was elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.He added: ldquoI will always consider Harold a friend and fellow unionist. He has overcome personal turmoil and, like many of us, has a strong faith which has encouraged and supported him through dficult times.ldquoI genuinely wish him all the best in whatever he chooses to do next.Earlier this year, DUP councillors Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen quit their party over concerns following the election of Edwin Poots as leader.Mr Poots was subsequently replaced by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP and a short time later Cllr Hanna, who also represents the Mournes area, and Cllr Owen, who represents the Rowallane area, rejoined the party..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_pitch.jpg","title":"New £12m sports pitch at Ballyhornan ‘fantastic facility’ for local community  ","story":"BALLYHORNANrsquoS new G sports pitch has been officially opened.The pound.m investment mdash which includes floodlights and ultra-modern changing facilities mdash has been funded by the Northern Ireland Executiversquos Social Investment Fund and Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Located adjacent to the Ballyhornan Family Centre, the new pitch is already widely used and has brought a number of benefits to the community.The Social Investment Fund contributed pound.m to the new development with the remainder provided by the local authority, with the Ballyhornan Community Association playing a pivotal role in helping secure the funding for the new pitch which was completed in October last year.Designed to increase access to community and leisure services by providing a fit-for-purpose, safe and structured environment to meet the needs and expectations of the Ballyhornan community and surrounding area, the new pitch will make a major contribution to help improve the health and well-being of people in the area.Ballyhornan and District Community Association chairwoman, Patricia Curran, expressed her delight to finally have a completed facility after years of rallying to secure funding for the G pitch which can be used all year round.ldquoWe are very grateful to all the statutory bodies and the local council who supported us throughout this campaign. Without them, we would not have achieved our goal, said Mrs Curran.ldquoThis pitch will be a great asset to Ballyhornan and outlying communities and we are very appreciative of this opportunity to provide a top of the range sports facility.Mrs Curran extended thanks to several people who worked with community officials to secure agreement for the new pitch and deliver it.Special thanks were extended to former local council officer Liam McLernon, Cllr Dermot Curran and former councillor Naomi Bailie for their ldquoimmense support.Mrs Curran also highlighted the support of Celtic Bhoys Football Club which uses the new pitch for its home games. She said the clubrsquos support was essential ldquoin making the project a success.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who performed the official opening, said one of the organisationrsquos key objectives was to improve the health and wellbeing of everyone in the district and reduce health inequalities.ldquoThis new facility will become a thriving hub that will have a hugely positive impact on the local area, benefitting the health and wellbeing of people of all ages by offering improved access to modern sporting facilities, she said.ldquoThis fantastic new facility is an excellent example of partnership working between statutory and voluntary groups and the health and wellbeing impact on our community will be immense.South Down MLA Colin McGrath said the official opening of the new pitch was ldquotestament to the work done by Mrs Curran and the team at Ballyhornan, working alongside officials from a number of organisations and elected representatives.ldquoItrsquos a real joy to see a picture of the late Eddie McGrady in the community centre in Ballyhornan who officially opened the building, he continued.ldquoThis latest development should serve as a reminder as to what can be delivered when communities, political representatives and government bodies work together in a common effort. I can only hope we get to see more of these good news stories in the time ahead.Cllr Curran said he was ldquodelighted to attend last weekrsquos official opening ceremony and thanked the funders of the new pitch for their respective contributions.ldquoThese investments are investments in our community and something we should all be very proud of. However, none of this would have happened without the hard work and determination of Patricia Curran and her team, he continued.ldquoGetting to this point over the past  years was a hard road with plenty of potholes, but Patricia never gave up. I am delighted that with help she get over those hurdles. However, had it not been for her dedication, this new pitch development simply wouldnrsquot have been possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_billy.jpg","title":"Politicians say ‘no’ to plan for school  ","story":"A NUMBER of politicians and school principals are opposed to creating a new integrated education college in the area.The proposed -place Mid Down Integrated Collegewould replace Blackwater Integrated College in Downpatrick, providing sixth-form places.Public consultation into the development proposal brought forward by the MDIC steering group ended in September and the Education Authorityhas already given its response to the parentsrsquo group behind the proposal.However, DUP politicians and three of four post-primary schools in the area mdash Saintfield High School, St Colmanrsquos High School and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch and St Colmcillersquos High in Crossgar mdash have publicly voiced their concerns for the first time.Strangford MLA Harry Harvey said: ldquoI am disappointed that despite widespread opposition locally, the Education Authority continue to press ahead with these proposals. The nearby Saintfield High School, a school supported by the entire community, is in dire need of funding for expansion and refurbishment.ldquoI would call on the EA to listen to the local community and support a truly cross community educational establishment that is already in existence.Cllr Billy Walker, who represents the area, said he will not supporting the development proposal, which he described as ldquoill-thought.ldquoAs an elected representative, I will not be supporting the call for an integrated college in the Mid Down area, he told the Recorder.ldquoFirst and foremost, I want to put on record that I am not opposed to integrated education in any shape or form.Cllr Walker said along with Strangford MP Jim Shannon, they lobbied for a new integrated primary school at Drumlins in Ballynahinch and were also instrumental in helping to get the funding to turn Killyleagh Primary School into an integrated school.He continued: ldquoMy credentials speak for themselves. My concern is that we have four post-primary schools in the Rowallane area that have been very successful in the last number of years.ldquoThe four schools are totally opposed to it as this will put serious pressure on these schoolsa new integrated college opens.ldquoThese schools have an excellent track record in working together in a cross-community basis which I have seen at first hand.The councillor claimed he had seen figures to show that Blackwater College was under-subscribed by pupils and local people have made representations to him about the development proposal.He and Mr Shannon recently met with the principals of the four local schools, including The High School Ballynahinch, to hear their concerns.ldquoHow can you honestly push for another integrated school in the Mid Down area when you have another one already under-subscribed, Cllr Walker continued.ldquoIf Blackwater wants to expand, hopefully in the near future Down High will get the go-ahead for its new build which would leave a site for Blackwater to move to. Thatrsquos something I could add my support to further down the line.ldquoBut I will not be quiet on this any longer. I have given a commitment, as has Mr Shannon, to the four schools we have visited that we are % behind their very robust case against which has been submitted to the Education Authority.Tim Jackson, co-chair of the MDIC steering group, said that the development proposal was looking at the future need for an integrated college.The group had already collected  expressions of interests from parents who would send their children to the school,along with  parents who are supportive but donrsquot have children of school age year.He also stressed that the schools had been consulted before the end of the last school year and the public consultation completed by September.ldquoWe feel that people have not understood what our approach and what our proposal is trying to achieve, continued Mr Jackson.ldquoWe are very much about increasing the provision of integrated education in the area, not at the expense of other schools but to support and reflect the support for it in the area and Northern Ireland as a whole.ldquoWe are not about trying to compete with other schools but are trying to deliver something that supports that demand of integrated education. We have had lots of support from local primary schools, many of which are integrated themselves and from other integrated colleges, who you could argue we would be in more competition with.He said that the group had written to every MP and MLA in the area and pointed out that Cllr Walker had not yet been briefed by them.ldquoHe did not take up the opportunity for us to brief him which might have assuaged some of the concerns he has highlighted, said Mr Jackson.ldquoAnd while we are hoping to establish a sixth form, we are not aware that the other local schools have also applied to do something like that.He added that the group were looking at the EArsquos response to the development proposal ldquoin detail as we think that some of our assertions have not been fully understood or appreciated as the EA looks at historical data while we are looking into the future as the urban and geographical landscape changes.Mark Morgan, principal of St Colmanrsquos, described the proposal as a ldquosolo run that disregards accepted protocols and should be dismissed.He added: ldquoIt is imperative that any proposals for change in any sector of the education system must be aligned to the area planning process.Saintfield High School principal Sarah-Lucy Hynds pointed out that irrespective of the proposal, her school would continue to strive for its own expansion.She said: ldquoSaintfield High Schoolrsquos campaign to grow has remained the same for decades. The challenges we face as a result of our capped enrolment at Year  must now be addressed as a matter of urgency.Mr Seamus Hanna, principal of St Colmcillersquos, said he was disappointed with the lack of ldquoproper consultation.ldquoOn a very basic level, the proposal ignored the reality that our staff and students already come from erse faith backgrounds and our ethos is and always has been, pupil centred, welcoming and respecting every pupil, regardless of faith or academic ability, he said.ldquoOn a higher level, it ignored the reality that schools must work in partnership to place student needs above institutional interests. An inclusive and imaginative solution would have received our whole-hearted support, but this current proposal unfortunately fell short of this vision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_smell.jpg","title":"Smell in Downpatrick causes stink with MLA  ","story":"A PERSISTENT foul smelling odour which is prevalent in a large part of Downpatrick is to be addressed by Northern Ireland Water.The utility company is to invest in a permanent dosing plant that will be added to sewage before it is pumped for treatment, with the news welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath.He said he had been lobbying for the odour issue to be addressed and had been working with NI Water to come up with a solution to the problem,The foul smell is noticeable in a large part of Downpatrick including the Ballymote Centre and parts of Killough Walk, Glebetown Drive, Bishops Brae Gardens, Mallard Road, Braeside Drive, Vianstown Road, Cathedral View, Pemberton Park and Pegasus Walk.ldquoEssentially we are looking at a quarter of Downpatrick affected by this odour issue, said Mr McGrath.ldquoIt has been a long road to get to this point, but NI Water is working to come up with a solution.

These volunteers didn’t put on a unorm and work long and dangerous hours over and above their daily employment hours to assist in any sectarianism. Like myself they made a decision to play their part in keeping the peace. They put their heads above the parapet, put their personal safety and that of their families on the line, making many sacrices to their quality of le in doing so. They were targets for terrorists   whether in or out of unorm and remained so even when they left the service. It was a le of constantly looking over your shoulder.The serious insult Dolores Kelly has directed at an entire organisation that lost over  members, many of them part time colleagues, is unfair, untrue and unwarranted. I realise that the history rewriters will have their own twisted opinions.What she has described is not what I experienced serving alongside some of the bravest and most dedicated public servants, both full and part time, you could wish to meet.I hope that she will reflect on her remarks.Alan Chambers, Ulster Unionist MLA, North DownMike Nesbitt joins calls for apology over MLA’s ‘sectarian’ RUC comments——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

While all babies are dferent, it can be helpful to think about working towards a routine by doing the same things in the same order each night so that baby learns what is coming next.Think about your little onersquos sleep environmentIt can be helpful to black out bedrooms, something that can be especially important in the summer months. Temperature is also important the Lullaby Trust, the baby sleep charity, say that the safest temperature for our little ones is - degrees celsius.Looking at how your little one falls asleep can help them get a more settled nightIt is very normal for your little one to be fed, rocked or cuddled to sleep, however this can be dficult to maintain. Practice other ways of getting your baby to sleep in their own sleep space to help find a method that suits you, your baby and your parenting style.Watch out for signs of tirednessWhile there are typical s of time that babies will happily stay awake for, the most important thing is getting to know your baby. By observing your baby, you can try to get them down for naps during the day before they get overtired. It is also important not to try to force naps when they are under tired.Fresh air and exerciseGetting out of the house for a bit will blow the cobwebs away and help your little one to burn off some energy. Inside the home your little one will also benefit from lots of time on the floor to keep them moving, while for small babies practising a bit of tummy time can be really helpful.Donrsquot always rush inhellipSometimes your little one will babble or make noise while they are asleep, and by going in too quickly we can disturb them. Equally they can sometimes wake and be happy in their sleep space. If your little one doesnrsquot need your assistance it is important to give them the space to get themselves back to sleep independently.Take care of yourself and donrsquot be afraid to ask for helpTherersquos no shame in not being able to do it all, all of the time. Being sleep deprived can be incredibly challenging and feel very lonely. Please know that is very normal for sleep to be dficult, especially in those early days. Please remember being a parent doesnrsquot always feel easy, because itrsquos not!

The SDLP policing board member also said the creation of the PSNI was a “signicant departure from the institutionalised sectarianism represented by the RUC”.Those comments led to the NI Retired Police Officers’ Association penning an open letter to Mrs Kelly, in which the NIRPOA chairman called on the MLA to withdraw her remarks, and to apologise for the “gross offence” caused.The letter states: “I am writing to seek your immediate withdrawal of that remark, and an apology for the gross offence you have caused to the thousands of members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary GC who served this community in the most challenging of times.”Mrs Kelly responded, saying: “The SDLP has previously paid tribute to the sacrices made by many RUC officers and their families.“The fact remains that there were severe institutional problems within the RUC and this is a matter of public record. That many retired police officers continue to refuse to cooperate with legacy investigations to this day speaks for itself.”Mrs Kelly added: “The transformation of the RUC to the PSNI has been an outstanding success and whilst policing continues to be challenging I think the hard work and efforts of the those involved in implementing Patten’s recommendations deserve credit.”Ulster Unionist policing board member Mr Nesbitt said he believes his SDLP counterpart should “reflect on her comments and the hurt they have caused and apologise”.He said: “The RUC were the barrier between Northern Ireland and complete anarchy. They bravely held the line throughout the Troubles.“Dolores Kelly’s comments have caused great hurt to former officers, their families and friends. Police officers didn’t wake up hoping to hurt someone, but every terrorist did, and it was police officers who were targeted simply because they were trying to protect society and save lives”.Mr Nesbitt added: “Nobody disputes that the RUC could have done with more Catholic officers within its ranks.“I have no doubt that many more would have come forward had it not been for the fact that the IRA made a special effort to target those Catholics who did join the RUC”.Mike NesbittPSNI  \"       \"  Most PopularMike Nesbitt joins calls for apology over MLA’s ‘sectarian’ RUC commentsRoad repairs branded ‘diabolical’Portadown: Four people taken to hospital after two vehicle crashHalloween hooligans’ rampage in Lurgan ‘terried’ residentsTotal of  years for heroin gangMost PopularTotal of  years for heroin gang‘What school grades do I need to join PSNI – and how much will I earn ’Stephen Barriskill killing: PSNI charge -year-old man with murderPSNI’s Organised Crime Branch searched JMC Mechanical and Construction Ltd premises days before firm collapsed‘Viable device’ found by bomb experts during Craigavon security alert                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsFollow us      "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1632989885154.jpg--top_tips_for_safe_student_accommodation.jpg?163298989300","title":"top tips for safe student accommodation ","story":"With freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
