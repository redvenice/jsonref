That evening, Epstein was filmed leaving the mansion with an unidentified woman, as newly-released stills, far right, show.They were spotted laughing and kissing as they walked away.While there is no suggestion of any impropriety on the part of the Duke, the fact he was drawn into Epstein’s toxic world and spent nearly a week in his company will surely raise further questions about his judgment and the statement he released yesterday.The December 2 dinner was held in the mansion’s second-floor dining room. TV anchor Katie Couric, once the highest-paid female presenter in the US, sat alongside comedian Chelsea Handler, a close friend of Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston. Also there was George Stephanopoulos, a former White House communications director under President Bill Clinton turned £15 million-a-year ABC News host.The soiree is believed to have also been attended by Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the disgraced media tycoon Robert Maxwell and Epstein’s one-time girlfriend.Multiple Epstein accusers have claimed that Ms Maxwell ‘procured’ girls for the perverted millionaire. She denies the allegations.Guests would have walked past bizarre erotic artwork en route to the dining room with its gleaming mahogany table, including a painting of Bill Clinton in red heels and a blue dress, a reference to the outfit worn by Monica Lewinsky when she performed a sex act on him.         Jeffrey Epstein and unidentified lady left his Upper East Side mansion, variously dubbed the House of Horror and the House of Depravity by the banker’s young victimsIn an interview published on Friday in the US political magazine Mother Jones, Epstein’s friend Stuart Pivar, a respected scientist, told how the financier loved to shock at his parties. Mr Pivar described one dinner party to which Epstein had invited a group of top scientists. ‘Jeffrey had no attention  whatsoever, he would interrupt the conversation and say things like, “What does that got to do with p***y?” That was his favorite expression. It was a subject changer.’Whether Andrew heard Epstein utter those crass words remains unknown but the Prince, albeit unwittingly, was undoubtedly a ‘draw’ in New York where ‘you can buy anything except the caché of Royalty’, according to one woman who attended an Epstein party.The socialite told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘There’s nothing socially mobile Manhattanites love more than brushing shoulders with a genuine member of the Royal Family. ‘Diana was a superstar. Prince Charles can command tens of thousands of dollars for tickets to a dinner. Jeffrey knew exactly what he was doing.‘Who is going to turn down the chance to mingle with a real-life Prince at dinner, even if the guy hosting it has a conviction for something as terrible as child molestation?         The Prince has fiercely denied any wrongdoing and knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, but he has faced questions about how he could have missed a procession of beautiful young women visiting the mansion during his six-day stay‘Royalty is stardust. People held their noses after Jeffrey was convicted but they were not going to turn down the chance to mingle with Royalty.’The Prince has fiercely denied any wrongdoing and knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, but he has faced questions about how he could have missed a procession of beautiful young women visiting the mansion during his six-day stay.‘There were girls coming and going the entire time Prince Andrew was inside the house,’ an eyewitness said.‘It was happening in broad daylight. If the Prince didn’t see all the girls coming through that door, he was the only person on 71st Street who didn’t. It was flagrant.‘At one point someone who looked like a royal protection officer came outside. Even if Andrew didn’t realise what was going on, you have to wonder why the people assigned to protect him didn’t say something?’Many of Epstein’s victims have described how assaults took place in an upstairs massage room which was strictly off-limits to other house guests.Some reports this week claimed Prince Andrew is now ‘fearful’ of returning to the US because he worries about being dragged into one of the multiple civil lawsuits being brought against Epstein’s £500 million estate. Lawyer Bradley Edwards, who represents several of the victims, said last night: ‘We would welcome the chance to speak to Prince Andrew under oath.’"},{"url":null,"title":"British travellers dedicated passport lines UK airports","story":"Share this article          Mr Gove, (pictured) Boris Johnson’s No Deal planning supremo, has ordered Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to examine the feasibility of creating separate queues         The move was vetoed on cost grounds last year by Sajid Javid (pictured) when he was Home SecretaryIt concluded that the committee’s secretariat should ‘schedule a discussion, led by the Transport Secretary, on introducing UK-only queues at airports’.The move comes amid growing concerns within Downing Street that Brussels will force British travellers into slower lanes with all other non-EU citizens when they go to the Continent.Home Secretary Priti Patel has vowed Brexit – which is currently set to fall at 11pm UK time on October 31 – will mark the formal end of the EU’s freedom of movement policy, despite opposition from officials who warned of potential chaos that could see Britons stranded on the Continent.Mr Javid had argued it would cost too much for Border staff to man separate desks in hotspots such as Heathrow.But cost fears have been brushed aside by Mr Johnson, who has boosted the UK’s budget for No Deal preparations by an extra £2.1 billion."},{"url":null,"title":"Sir Elton John set feature new set stamps mark 50 years showbiz","story":"Share this article               It is understood there will be a set of four stamps, each charting a different phase of his career (pictured: A Mail on Sunday interpretation of how the stamps commemorating Sir Elton’s career could look)A source said: ‘To Elton, this is the most tremendous honour.

Yet Don’t Believe A Word is too wise, and too personal, to be regarded as just another book on language: it entertains just as much as it informs.An account of how learning Arabic led Shariatmadari to become more engaged and tolerant in society sets the scene. As he writes: “My first experience of a non-Indo-European language… overturned my assumptions about what language was.” This began his journey of sorts, with his scholarly interest in the roots and development of language always underpinned by its everyday use. He points out that “in terms of establishing a human connection, there was something fundamental about getting to grips with the language”, and this longing for connection gives Shariatmadari’s story its heart and soul.Shariatmadari has no truck with the idea that our language is somehow poorer than that of our ancestors, briskly arguing that “linguistic decline is the cultural equivalent of the boy who cried wolf”. He makes some interesting points about the conservatism inherent within linguistics, describing “proper” English, of the kind that you might read in this newspaper, as being controlled by middle-aged, middle-class people, and therefore representing “the dialect of power”. The reader cannot help but be reminded of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s regrettable attempts to impose his views of what proper and improper English is upon his unfortunate parliamentary staff. Shariatmadari, a  journalist, is excellent on the way in which class associations between language and an accent are immediately forged, just as there is no such thing as a classless, accentless use of language everyone has an accent as a social identifier, even if it’s just a form of RP.There are reminders of the gravity of language throughout, and how it distinguishes itself from “lesser” forms Shariatmadari cites the Yiddish maxim that “a language is a dialect with an army and navy”. He is also incisive on the way in which forbidden words have their own power, writing that taboos “are not anthropological curiosities, confined to museums – they are real and have meaning”. One wishes for slightly longer on some fascinating subjects, such as Polari, which is briefly mentioned in a footnote and probably deserves its own book, but, inevitably, there cannot be enough space to do justice to all of the associations and ‘clubs’ of language.The odd section can be somewhat hard going, despite Shariatmadari’s obvious enthusiasm, but some good jokes make up for that I especially enjoyed a line on how Madonna’s accent, after years of life in Britain, became “more Downton than Downtown”. And, above all, this is a generous and enthralling study of the basis of how we communicate. At its close, Shariatmadari compares linguistics to Schatzkammer, a German term for treasure chamber. Readers of this fine book will enjoy taking part in this particular treasure hunt, with Shariatmadari serving as their more than able guide. • Don’t Believe a Word by David Shariatmadari is published by Weidenfeld \u0026amp Nicolson (£16.99).

As the veteran Irish novelist arranged herself at a small table lit by a single lamp, I wondered how many of those present were aware of her literary lineage or even knew who she was. She waited for silence to settle before speaking – quietly at first, but with an intensity of purpose that belied her advancing years. “I was a girl once,” she began, “but not any more.”I can still recall the rapt silence that attended her every word and hung in the air for a long moment after her reading ended. Then came the applause, heartfelt and sustained. It was an exercise in almost primal storytelling: stark, dramatic and pitch-perfect in its execution. A lesson from a master.O’Brien’s new novel, Girl, opens with that same haunting sentence, matter of fact and regretful. What follows is a contemporary story as raw and transfixing as the most visceral Greek tragedy, a story of abduction, rape and imprisonment recounted in often unflinching detail by Maryam, the young Nigerian girl of the title. It is, as the American novelist Richard Ford attests, a work “of profound empathy and grace”, its narrative leavened by deftly wrought moments of maternal intimacy that possess a quiet but almost luminous intensity.O’Brien is 88. Girl is her 19th novel and she has intimated that it may be her last. It may yet prove to be her most powerful.The idea for the novel came from a newspaper report about a girl who was found wandering in Sambisa Forest in Nigeria. “Every day the newspapers are full of novels waiting to be written, but this small item resonated in my inner mind,” she recalls. “The girl had escaped her captors, but she had lost her mind and she was carrying a baby. I could not have written this novel if the violence and injustice done to this young woman and many others hadn’t been moulded on to my self and my soul.”In 2016 and 2017, O’Brien made two trips to Nigeria, where she met several young women who had escaped captivity, having been among the 276 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram jihadists in the Nigerian town of Chibok in April 2014. “You hear these terrible stories and you absorb them,” she says. “They haunt me still. I wake sometimes thinking of the girls and the horrors they experienced.”Girl is unlike any of the novels that preceded it in O’Brien’s 60-year career, the style spare and restrained, the terrain unfamiliar, a world away from the landscape and discontents of her native Ireland. “It was new territory for me, emotionally, geographically, culturally,” she says. “I had to discard the things that have fortified my writing for 60 years – landscape, lyricism, love. I had to put all those things aside and just e in as if this was the first book I had ever written.”I meet O’Brien at her modest terraced house on a quiet, well-to-do street in Chelsea. In older age, she remains glamorous, dressed today in a pleated top and three-quarter length skirt. Her eyes are alert and alive, especially when she laughs, but she is very pale and very thin.“I have not been in great health this past year,” she says, when I ask her how she is doing. “I want and hope to get better. Right now, I am conserving my energy for the things that are most important to me, and writing is very high on that list.”She makes tea in her homely ground-floor kitchen, handing me the cups and ushering me up the stairs ahead of her while she follows slowly and tentatively, pausing for breath at the turn of the stairs. We settle in the first-floor living room, which is also a work space. The wall behind her is lined floor to ceiling with books, including several novels by the mostly male big-hitters she admires: Roth, Pinter, Beckett, Joyce – the first three of whom she befriended, the fourth whom she admires more than any other writer.It is unmistakably a writer’s room, a retreat of sorts, but also a place of hard graft. A desk in the corner by the fireplace is cluttered with manuscripts and writing pads. While researching Girl, she tells me, she amassed four boxes of notebooks and 16 boxes of research material. She picks up an early draft of the novel from the low table between us. “I’m a perfectionist,” she says, opening it at a page decorated with handwritten notes and corrections. “I work so hard to get things right, changing lines and words right up to the end. It’s exhausting, but absolutely necessary.”Her editor, Lee Brackstone, who has recently departed Faber, describes her as “an artist who adheres to the now old-fashioned belief that it should be difficult by necessity to make great work”. It is, he adds, “almost masochistic with Edna: if she’s feeling the pain, she’s making the art. That inevitably takes its toll.”I ask her if this novel was more exhausting than the others. She nods. “I don’t want to sound self-pitying about it, but it was the hardest and the most painful. I’m not exactly in the prime of youth. There was a point where I was faced with a long table filled with pages and pages of writing, hundreds of pages. You ask yourself, ‘What am I doing? Why am I doing this?’” Has she found a satisfactory answer? “It’s what I chose to do,” she replies without hesitation, “but, more than that, it’s my life. Writing is my breathing.”In a recent BBC documentary, she described her state of mind on departing for Nigeria as “fearful and fearless”. She also confessed to having smuggled £15,000 into the country, wads of cash concealed in her sleeves and her underwear. “I worked out that I would need roughly that much to give to people who could help me to arrange things. And, sure enough, it all got spent.”There, she met and interviewed doctors, aid workers, a trauma specialist and local journalists. She undertook often arduous journeys overland to visit camps for displaced persons, some of whom followed her around, pleading to be rescued. At one point, she stayed in a convent, which, she says laughing, “is one place I never expected to be”. And, through her contacts, she met the girls – Rebecca, Abigail, Hope, Patience, Fatime, Amina and Hadya – whose survivor’s stories she absorbed and then transformed into the novel’s single, soul-searing narrative.“They each spoke to me in a similar way,” she tells me, “which was understated, reserved, guarded. They are so young and shy and protective of their modesty, even after all that has happened to them, the brutal horror of what they went through. There is shame, too, alas. It was heartbreaking and I found myself crying a lot.”All of this, I venture, would have been physically and emotionally demanding for a much younger writer, never mind one in her late 80s. She nods and falls silent for a time. “It still is emotionally demanding, even to think about it. It was not just a new country for me, but a new everything. I thought I was in the Tower of Babel when I arrived in Abuja airport… the noise, the chaos. There were times when it felt like I was on a constant knife edge. And, as I say this, I feel almost mortified, because the girls I have written about are not on a knife edge, they are in hell. Their trauma continues and will stay with them for ever. At least I was able to come home.”If Girl was written out of a mixture of fierce anger and deep empathy, it was also, one suspects, driven by a keen awareness of O’Brien’s own encroaching mortality. Is it something she finds herself dwelling on? “Well, I’m aware of it… I’d have to be, wouldn’t I? I’d be Pollyanna if I weren’t,” she shoots back, laughing. “But it’s not that I think of it every day it’s more that I want to do the things that I must do. And I want to go out as someone who kept to the truth. I can’t bear phoneys. I want integrity.”Truth-telling of a kind was what fired her early books – The Country Girls (1960), Girl With Green Eyes (1962), Girls in Their Married Bliss (1964) – and fuelled her reputation for scandal in her homeland. The novels articulated what, until then, had remained relatively unspoken in staunchly Catholic Ireland: female sexual desire, active and acted upon. It was expressed gleefully by her young female protagonists, whose determination to enjoy themselves was, in itself, an instinctive act of rebellion against parochialism and patriarchy. The authorities responded by banning her books, the clergy by denouncing her from the pulpit. In her home town of Tuamgraney, County Clare, which she recently described as “not a town at all, but a hill with some pubs”, the local postmistress told her mother that, should her daughter dare to return, she “should be kicked naked through the streets”.Those early novels had other less seismic, but more abiding, reverberations. “Looking at The Country Girls now, it is not so shocking,” says Irish novelist Anne Enright, “but what endures is the way she portrays the friendship between the two girls. When I first read it at 16, what really chimed with me was their adventurousness, their defiant spirit. Female friendship had not been written about in that way in an Irish context until she came along.”The raw material for her early books was her own young life, which, as described in her wonderfully evocative 2012 memoir, Country Girl, was both fearful and transportive. She was raised in a once-grand house, the youngest child of a beleaguered mother and a sometimes tyrannical father. “He was too fond of the drink,” she tells me, “but sadly for us, he was one of those unfortunate men who the drink did not agree with.” She grew up in fear of his rages, often retreating as a child to the surrounding fields to daydream and to write imaginary stories in which, she recalled later, “the words ran away with me”.In 1958, in the hope of furthering his writing career, Gébler relocated the family to London, where O’Brien found herself marooned in the drab outer suburbs of London with their two young children. It was there, in the hours between dropping off Carlo and Sasha at school and picking them up again, that she began writing, in a burst of feverish creativity. “The words poured out on to the page,” she says. “It was the first and only time that happened.” In Country Girl, she remembers writing in floods of tears, but “they were good tears. They touched on feelings I did not know I had.” They were feelings that at least one generation of young Irish women connected with deeply. As novelist Eimear McBride later put it: “The Country Girls is not the novel that broke the mould, it is the one that made it… O’Brien gave voice to a previously muzzled generation of Irish women.”Her suddenly unleashed creativity unwittingly incensed Gébler, who appeared at breakfast one morning with a manuscript copy of the novel in his hand. He told her: “You can write and I will never forgive you.” Their marriage was dissolved in 1964 and, against the odds, O’Brien was granted custody of the children after a three-year legal battle in which supposedly scandalous passages from her fourth novel, August Is a Wicked Month, were used as evidence of her wayward character.In the 1960s and 1970s, when she was famous and fashionably scandalous, her regular house parties in Chelsea drew the likes of Marlon Brando, Richard Burton and Robert Mitchum to her door. (According to her memoir, she succumbed only to the latter’s advances: “We danced all the way up to the bedroom... with all the shyness of besotted strangers in syrupy songs.”) For all that, though, she never remarried. I ask her if the trauma of that first, ill-fated union had hardened her against tying the knot again. She nods. “I suppose I was always hooked on this idea of love, by which I mean deep love. I didn’t have one-night flings, I just didn’t. Not out of morality, but more my own conviction that love is so serious. Of course, it’s carnal and it’s many other things, but it’s such a unity. I suppose I got that from my religion very early on.”So, for her, love is an almost sacred ideal?“Sacred – with profanity,” she replies, laughing.It was that other great Irish romantic, WB Yeats, who described the creative life as a process of continuous self-reinvention – “Myself must I remake.” As her run of late novels attests, O’Brien seems to be living by that dictum. Where once she wrote about the interior lives of her female protagonists, since the mid-1990s she has looked outwards for her subject matter, at the state of things, politically and culturally. It was a typically bold move that followed a fallow period when her high lyrical style felt out of fashion with reviewers and audiences alike.“Literature is a volatile business,” says her son, Carlo. “You are dependent on your latest success. When the critical tide turned against her, she shifted her voice. It became less lyrical, but there was absolute fidelity to clarity, lucidity and directness. It is those virtues that are at the centre of her literary practice.”The shift occurred, O’Brien tells me, “as my conscience and my consciousness opened out a bit to what was happening around me.” The first evidence of this change in style and subject matter came with 1994’s The House of Splendid Isolation, the first of what might be called her state-of-the-nation novels. It remains an interestingly flawed book, almost postmodern in its fragmented narrative style, but the stylistic experimentation was all but overlooked in scathing reviews that took issue with her too-sympathetic portrayal of an Irish Republican gunman.“Someone in the Spectator said I did not deserve the gifts I had been given,” she says, still sounding mortally offended. Though her writing had, as she puts it, “deepened and darkened”, she was doing what she had always done: writing against the received wisdoms that prevailed in her homeland.“In the south of Ireland, what you heard most often was that there was a war going on up there in the north and that they were all as bad as each other. I felt that was both untrue on the ground and untrue to history, to what will be written and said 50 years from now.”Controversy also stalked her 2002 novel, In the Forest, which drew on a real tragedy that had transfixed Ireland eight years before: the triple murder of a mother, child and priest by a mentally disturbed man. The pre-eminent Irish critic, Fintan O’Toole, described it as “a novel too far”, later writing that “there is simply no artistic need for so close an intrusion into other people’s grief”. When I broach that criticism now, she takes a deep breath and says: “If García Márquez or other writers write those sort of stories, they are not attacked in their own country for it but I am and I always have been attacked. I partly think it’s to do with being a woman… and with the assumption that I approach themes that I shouldn’t.”O’Brien remains an indomitable presence, the defiance and determination that drove her younger self still apparent despite her physical fragility. A few weeks after we speak, she sends me an email suggesting she is aware that, at 88, she may still provoke controversy with the publication of Girl.Her life, though, like her work, has become pared down. “I’m no longer a habitue of the social whirl,” she says, smiling. “But I love real conversations, whether with a shepherd or Schopenhauer, I don’t care. So long as one is lifted from one’s own stew to other things – and learning, always learning.”When she’s not writing, she says to my surprise, she watches football: “I love football, all football.” Of late, too, she has been transfixed by the HBO series Chernobyl: “It was so meticulously plotted I kept thinking of the opening chapters of War and Peace.”I ask her if, despite her run-ins with the Irish clergy, she is spiritually inclined. “I think so, yes. I have the necessity to think there is a God, but not the God I was breastfed on… a more compassionate one. But, when faced with the horror we see on the nightly news, any sane person would wonder, where is God in this scenario? So I am very puzzled and ided by God. That’s honestly how I feel.”Though she has no plans to return to Ireland, she has “a very lovely grave” there. It is situated on a holy island on the River Shannon.“It’s my mother’s family grave, but, ironically, she herself is not buried there, because she wanted her grave to be in a village where people passing by would say a prayer for her. Whereas I want the birds, and the old monasteries that are ruined, and the lake and just the song of nature.”I ask her if she has any regrets. “No, not really. I have been a bit foolish in my life,” she says, chuckling, “I’m a bit of a deep thinker, but I’ve been foolish with money, foolish in love. But, regrets are a waste of time. One moves on. One has to. In the moment, I am capable of real anger, because I am a passionate and furious creature as well as being a rather tender one. I am capable of Medea murder,” she says, laughing, “but I am not old and bitter.”The following day, the Man Booker prize longlist is announced. Mystifyingly, Girl is not on it. When we speak again, she is disappointed, but philosophical. “All I will say is, I’m not throwing in the towel yet. There will be other prizes.”There may also be other books. Though she suggested recently that Girl would be her final novel, she tells me there may be another, but that it exists at present “only on the nascent horizon”. Still engaged, still curious, still defiant, Edna O’Brien may yet surprise us once again.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s begin with a tribute to Ronald Blythe’s Akenfield by PatLux:I just spoke to my 88 year-old mother who is reading Akenfield, which is reminding her of her own rural childhood and the stories told to her by her parents. I had discovered it in a charity shop in Edinburgh and brought it back to Luxembourg to read and enjoy. I then passed it on to my sister in Spain who devoured it and discussed with me scenes that resonated with her. She then gave it to my mother in northern England and when she has finished it we will donate it to the bookstall in our family’s village church for someone else to discover. I wonder where it will go next and I trust that it will give as much joy to the next reader as it has done to three of us. Many thanks to whoever it was on Tips, Links and Suggestions who inspired me to add this title to the list which I take with me to charity shops.MereMortal has “finally got round to starting” Howard Zinn’s “legendary” The People’s History of the United States:I’ve known about it for a decade or more and have owned it for about three years. He’s the most marvellous and sympathetic writer and he brings out of obscurity a wealth of highly character-driven stories of African slaves, American Indians, indentured white European servants, and women. People he considers were always omitted by the founding fathers when they declaimed “we the people”.I’m loving it. Zinn was that rare thing, an American socialist and a superb academic and this book was a massive hit as a history book and has been widely translated around the world.LLCoolJ is in need of lighter reading after finishing one of this year’s Booker nominations, Lost Children Archive by Valeria Luiselli:Here we have a “No names, please” family of four – Ma, Pa, boy, girl – driving from NYC to Arizona. The parents are documentariansdocumentarists (definitions and distinctions provided) who worked together on a sound-recording project that among other things recorded the over 800 languages spoken in NYC (I had no idea there are that many). Ma is now focused on a project about the “lost children” and detained migrants from Central America, and Pa is working on a project related to the Apaches. The marriage, it is announced early on, is ending, and it is projected that the parents will separate at the end of the trip, each taking one of the children.The first half of the book is narrated by ‘Ma’, and I was pulled in right away by the style of the writing. Much of it is muted, internal, Ma’s ruminations about her children and her marriage and her project ... I didn’t participate in the last two RG books because I didn’t feel I had the strength to take on Levi or Steinbeck. This book turned out to be just as harrowing. I expect it will haunt me for a long time, and I feel the need for something frothy next. So … Nina Stibbe, here I come.GELBuck has “just finished” The Frayed Atlantic Edge by David Gange:His series of kayak journeys down the Atlantic coasts of Scotland, Ireland and bits of Wales and England is the thread linking history, culture, geography and nature. A different perspective on our history and a book that makes me want to retire immediately and spend my time reading and kayaking on a west coast somewhere!Ubik by Phillip K Dick has been keeping Bacon78 guessing:The question of what is reality is explored here with a fun plot that keeps you guessing, and the philosophy never gets in the way of a good story. How do I know what I am experiencing is reality? How do I know that I’m not a simulation in an advanced computer, or that my reality is a product of my own imagination, and I’m actually in a coma somewhere on life support? Well, I don’t and neither do the characters in Ubik!!Richard Flanagan’s The Sound of One Hand Clapping has moved paulburns:A heart-wrenching story of a father-daughter relationship, set against the background of WW@ refugees living and working in Tasmania from 1954 to 1990. There are so many twists and turns in the story, most of them unexpected, that it would be unfair to other readers to give too many details. Suffice to say Flanagan writes with lyricism and passion of his beloved island, with his usual deep and sensitive understanding of the human condition.Finally, a eulogy in honour of Sebastian Barry from JayZed:Crikey, Sebastian Barry‘s a splendid writer, isn’t he? I was blown away a few weeks ago by Days Without End, and I’ve now been moved by The Secret Scripture. If I didn’t rate it quite as highly as Days Without End, that’s mostly because I loved DWE so much.A lot of similarities between the two books, despite the contrasting plots. In both Barry is masterful in creating compelling and distinctive narrative voices and both books are ultimately stories which celebrate love and humanity within a context of brutal cruelty.He can certainly write them.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

We are getting in touch with all those customers this afternoon to clarify that their flight will go ahead as planned. We are sorry for any confusion and inconvenience this has caused.”He said anyone who went on to spend money on alternative arrangements should contact British Airways “and we will deal with each case on an inidual basis”.The spokesman clarified that some flights on non-strike days would be affected, but that the bulk of those cancelled would be on the three strike days.Numerous passengers on flights that will be grounded tried in vain to contact the airline to make alternative arrangements on Saturday. One told the PA news agency his 10-year wedding anniversary “trip of a lifetime” was in doubt after more than 100 calls to BA to get a refund went unanswered.The airline’s customer service lines were jammed on Saturday morning after passengers booked on flights received emails overnight warning “a large number of delays and cancellations” were likely during the action.Scott Kishere, a filmmaker and police community officer, told PA: “My wife and I have been told that our flight to Toronto has been cancelled. This was a full package we booked through BA for our 10-year wedding anniversary. I have made over 100 attempts to contact them for a refund and they’re not answering.“Until we get a refund, we do not have the money to rebook our trip of a lifetime. With the days counting down, it now looks unlikely we will be able to celebrate our 10-year anniversary as expected.”Kishere, from Dorset, is one of hundreds of passengers who have tried desperately to contact BA via social media and its phone lines. He said he also planned to travel to Chicago for the city’s marathon with his partner a week after the final day of strikes, but feared that could also be impacted.“We have worked so hard for these trips and BA do not have the decency or customer care to support us. For them this has been on the cards for a long time and I cannot believe they didn’t have a contingency in place.”BA has said its proposed pay deal had been accepted by members of the Unite and GMB unions, which represent engineers, cabin crew and ground staff.Balpa said more strike dates could yet be announced, adding that they were “a last resort and with enormous frustration at the way the business is now being run”.The airline said it would offer refunds and rebookings, adding: “We will do everything we can to get as many people away on their journeys as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a353d977607f6430f5bb59ba843ddb90f8f84466/0_903_5145_3087/master/5145.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef701ab67991e66cd463e45b61ee8ed4","title":"homophobic midnight cowboy gay men film 50","story":"Midnight Cowboy moseys into UK cinemas again next month on the occasion of its 50th anniversary, and with it comes another opportunity to ask whether this is a film about homophobia or a homophobic film. At the risk of sounding perverse, I really don’t mind. My feelings toward the film were formed by seeing it in my early teens, when I already knew I was gay and hankered after images of other gay men on screen without caring whether they were problematic or toxic – words, incidentally, that would never have been used in that context when I first saw it in the mid-1980s.In its portrayal of the friendship between two New York City street hustlers – the budding gigolo Joe Buck (Jon Voight), tall and sweet as an ice-cream sundae, and the stunted, snivelling chancer “Ratso” Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) – the picture hints at the inexpressible desires in any bromance. Ratso bandies the word “faggot” around and mocks Joe for the campness of his cowboy duds. Evidently the homophobe doth protest too much, for we have been privy to Ratso’s fantasies in which Joe runs shirtless with him along the beach.It is the penultimate scene, when Joe robs, beats and perhaps even kills a gay client, that throws the movie into disarray. The scene itself provides a snapshot of Joe’s own shame and self-doubt, and a film should be allowed to depict the consequences of homophobia without being accused of perpetuating it. But it’s the way the attack on that man is swept blithely aside in the next scene that casts doubts on the motives of the film, and on the integrity of its gay British director, John Schlesinger. So why is it that I struggle to take offence?What we look for in our formative years can be very different from the demands we make later as analytical adults, and it was certainly more important to me that representations of gayness were complex or colourful than that they were positive, whatever that meant. As far as I was concerned, film-makers were welcome to be hostile or mocking toward homosexuality just so long as they didn’t ignore it. I would have taken animosity over anonymity any day.Perhaps that sounds as if I had fallen in love with my captors. What heterosexual audiences may need longer to appreciate, having grown up surrounded by reflections of their own kind on every screen and billboard, is that gay audiences will take whatever image they can get and then drain it for meaning and nourishment. Like our counterparts in other underrepresented minorities, we learn to be fastidious noticers and collectors, seizing on any old leftover and rustling up a banquet for one. That explains my affection for films that wouldn’t pass the gay equivalent of the Bechdel test.As a child, I wanted to visit the secret nightclub in The Pink Panther Strikes Again where everyone is limp-wristed and light in the loafers. When Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau dances with another man, you aren’t meant to find it romantic – just daft. And while the club is a grotesque caricature (well, this is a Pink Panther film and not Ken Loach), the joke is manifestly on Clouseau, in his stiffness and discomfort: everyone but him is having a blast.Similarly, no one in the James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever is having quite as much fun as Mr Wint (Bruce Glover) and Mr Kidd (Putter Smith), the skipping, hand-holding assassins who never forget their manners even in the middle of a murder. I didn’t mind them being psychos. Better psychos than nothing.Colin (Paul Freeman) may be sliced up at the start of The Long Good Friday while cruising at a swimming pool, but I loved seeing the whole plot set in motion by a gay man’s desires, even if they do prove fatal. I didn’t even mind it when the mob boss Harold (Bob Hoskins), Colin’s childhood friend, says: “You know how bitchy queers get when their looks start to go.” Disparaging words can be argued with and contested. Silence can’t.There were nuanced representations of gayness when I wanted them (Dog Day Afternoon, My Beautiful Laundrette, The Naked Civil Servant) but it was a different kind of detective work winkling out the gay bits in otherwise straight films. The flasher in High Anxiety, say, who exposes himself to Mel Brooks in an airport toilet, then squeals when Brooks flees in horror. “Don’t be so gauche,” he calls after him. “We’re all doing it!” Or the flamboyant theatre director Roger DeBris (Christopher Hewett) in Brooks’s The Producers. Max (Zero Mostel) and Leo (Gene Wilder) call in on him at his apartment. “He’s wearing a dress,” hisses Leo under his breath. “No kidding,” says Max.In A Taste of Honey, Geoffrey (Murray Melvin) has been thrown out by his landlady for canoodling with a fella, while in Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges are sweethearts in all but the letter of the script you just have to spot the signs. There’s a mohawk-sporting biker in Mad Max 2 whose twink boyfriend is killed by a metal boomerang. And Michael Caine even kisses Christopher Reeve (Superman!) in the 1982 film Deathtrap: the first time I had seen one man’s lips on another’s.That film was directed by Sidney Lumet, who made Dog Day Afternoon. Gay was very big that year, what with Personal Best (sporty lesbians) and Making Love (a married man having a gay affair). It was the Deathtrap smacker, though, that was all over the news. Was the film sensationalist, even homophobic? Undoubtedly. But at least, in the words of the theme song from Midnight Cowboy, it got everybody talkin’. It was down to me to try to make sense of what was being said.• Ryan Gilbey is a film critic for the New Statesman and writes on film for the , Sunday Times and Sight \u0026amp Sound"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7535f41d71f7f7b63479f107847ff0915ba96666/0_120_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aba4c37e885ed9124919e206573c70f6","title":"how can children thrive squeezed cramped homes","story":"Shipping containers meant as a quick fix for the housing crisis have become a trapPersonal space is a political issue. Analysing data from the English Housing Survey, supplemented by a Comres poll of families in overcrowded housing, the National Housing Federation (NHF) reports that 130,000 families are living in one-bedroom homes. An estimated 1.3 million children live in overcrowded homes, defined as children sleeping in the same room as two or more siblings, their parents or a teenager of the opposite sex.Just 6,000 homes were built in 2018 for social rent, despite at least 145,000 being needed. Some children are sleeping three to a bed, with adults sleeping in kitchens, halls and bathrooms to free up space. There are 96,000 more children living like this than a decade ago. An estimated 92,000 children are thought to be sofa-surfing with their families and not even registering in the figures.In some areas, emergency accommodation, made from shipping containers, has been erected in response to the housing crisis and homelessness. In my time, I’ve lived in everything from council housing to squats to a caravan in someone’s front garden, but there’s something disturbing about these converted containers. They actually look quite groovy – you can see why they’d be considered a step up from squalid bed and breakfasts – but my first thought was that they must overheat in the summer.It seems they do: tenants say they’re unable to breathe during heatwaves and some resort to sleeping on the walkways with their children. There’s no wifi for job hunting or benefit claims. And although they’re classed as emergency accommodation, people end up feeling “dumped” there. It goes without saying that they’re tiny and cramped, with barely any room for belongings. As with all overcrowding scenarios, size is everything.Labour’s shadow housing secretary, John Healey, made the point that the country is building 30,000 fewer social rented homes a year than in 2010, with more than a million households on waiting lists. The NHF’s chief executive, Kate Henderson, says that the only solution is a radical public spending programme (£12.8bn) to build more social housing.Clearly, something must be done to rectify a situation that has gone from unacceptable to dehumanising. Families are jammed in like sardines, having to work out how and where to sleep, with stress and mental health issues for adults and children. It would be interesting to know what proportion of the children celebrating great GCSE results last week had their own bedrooms, or a quiet, private space to do homework and revise, and how many lived in one-bedroom flats, bed and breakfasts, shipping containers or converted office blocks.Under such conditions, it’s not even a debate about how families are living – they are merely existing. Maybe that’s what’s so disturbing about measures such as the converted shipping containers. They may work as an emergency fix, but not if people get stuck there. Then they become exposed for what they are – nothing short of British shanty towns, with whole families crammed into tin boxes.Speaking to an audience of programme-makers at the Edinburgh TV festival, the presenter Jeff Brazier wondered if the new duty of care regulations for reality TV meant that someone such as Jade Goody, his former partner and mother of his children, would now make it on to the shows.The three-part Channel 4 documentary Jade: The Reality Star Who Changed Britain has been harrowing viewing. While Goody was prepared to live on camera, she couldn’t have envisaged practically dying on it too, though in her defence, she was trying to raise money for her children to the end.As for the idea of vulnerable characters such as Goody not making it through the audition process, I’m not so sure. She was bubbly and outgoing, rather than introverted and nervous. Her troubled family background was probably not that different from many young viewers, meaning she’d still be highly “relatable”. Nor did Goody fracture under the pressure of “normal” fame – the Celebrity Big Brother race row and her terminal cancer were exceptional circumstances.It’s time that reality TV put its house in order – the people they feature deserve more than to be treated like televisual cannon fodder. However, Goody didn’t slip through the net – she jumped into the net, seeing it as the best chance she’d ever get. Despite how it all ended, she was right.There’s a rather charming photograph of Rod Stewart at his daughter Kimberly’s birthday party, hanging out with four of the five mothers of his children – Alana Stewart, Rachel Hunter, Kelly Emberg and his wife, Penny Lancaster.Stewart is plonked in the middle, wearing a gold-embossed waistcoat and leopardskin shoes, for all his millions, resembling a bingo caller on a budget ferry. To his credit, he isn’t looking even slightly terrified that the women are about to go off in a huddle to “compare and contrast”. He says he’s proud to be on friendly terms with them and so he should be, considering the black holes many former couples fall down after a split, even when children are involved.Four out of five amicable serious exes is impressive (though the fifth, who had to give up the baby for adoption, remains estranged). Could he have beaten Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow to be the greatest of all “conscious-uncouplers” – or was he just before his time?Time was, splitting (without kids) was simple. You had an unseemly row, momentarily forgetting to be your best selves, stuck pins in voodoo effigies for a bit, then forgot about them. Forever! It was ugly, it verged on Sicilian (“You’re dead to me!”) but at least it was simple. Modern couples are supposed to be hyper-mindful of complex post-couple consequences, not least the impact a bitter split could have on their increasingly vital social circles. Thus, the post-relationship friendship has become a “thing”.In Stewart’s case, there’s the more obvious glue of children. He’s also rich, so the financial pressure is off, though Rod, bless him, is reputed to be tighter than a sealed pistachio. Still, it’s an achievement for all concerned that they’ve remained on good terms – and for him to have the sense to be proud of that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4107bcf131e9b02b5ec2a883efad332fbb2c3f39/0_106_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0beb44177f09012cb0a849babe3485f","title":"private schools igcse exams easier gcse university admissions","story":"Top universities are giving privately educated children an unfair advantage by not differentiating between the rigorous GCSEs compulsory in the state system and less demanding exams taken in many fee-paying schools, MPs and educationists have said.Just days after GCSE results day last Thursday, Freedom of Information (FoI) requests by Labour MP Lucy Powell show that almost all Russell Group universities treat the two types of exam – the regulated GCSEs used in the state system, and IGCSEs, which the government admits do not meet the same high standards – as exact equivalents in admission processes.This weekend, Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons education select committee, said it was extraordinary that state school pupils were taking harder exams than their private school counterparts, and that these qualifications were then treated as the same by universities. “The priority has to be a level playing field,” Halfon said. “I find it extraordinary that … pupils in private schools, who start with many advantages, are then able to take inferior exams. Everyone should have the chance to climb the education ladder, without unfair advantage to those in private schools.”Responding to FoIs requests from Powell, only Cambridge University among the 24 Russell Group universities said it did not take exam results at key stage 4 (14-16 years) into account when deciding which students to admit. The other 23 said they did take them into account and made no distinction between the two.Powell, a former shadow education secretary, called on the government to act to ensure state school pupils were no longer disadvantaged in the race for places at top universities. She said: “It’s an absolute scandal that it is easier to get top grades in IGCSEs than in the new GCSEs, yet universities essentially class them as the same. State schools do an excellent job – often in difficult circumstances, and now with reduced funding – to help young people get the best GCSE results they can. There’s been a lot of turmoil with the new system, which private schools, by shirking away from the new GCSEs, have shielded their pupils from.”She called on ministers and Ofqual, the exam regulator, to conduct an urgent review of admissions criteria in order to restore fairness and direct universities to ensure the tough new GCSEs were properly counted.Peter Hyman, founder of School 21, a state-funded school for children aged four-18 in east London, said: “Private schools already have a lot stacked in their favour. To have a two-tier system in which no account is taken of the fact that one system is harder is obviously wrong.”Earlier this year the chair of Ofqual, Roger Taylor, told the education select committee that the current system “is not conducive to public trust in the examination system”. A spokesman for Ofqual said last night: “People should be careful when using GCSE and International GCSEs interchangeably … However, we recognise that such precise comparison might not be an issue for everyone. Universities and employers are used to seeing many different qualifications on applications and deciding what value they place on them.”The Department for Education, which reformed the GCSE system when Michael Gove was education secretary, admits that the new exams are more rigorous than those still widely used in the private sector.When the Observer first raised the issue last December the DfE said: “International GCSEs have not been through the same regulatory approval and quality control as the new gold-standard GCSEs, which is why we no longer recognise international GCSEs in school performance tables. The new GCSE qualifications have been reformed to provide more rigorous content, so young people are taught the knowledge and skills they need for future study and employment.”A DfE spokesperson said this weekend: “Independent schools are by definition independent and make their own decisions about what qualifications to offer. If a school decides to offer international GCSEs instead of reformed 9-to-1 GCSEs, it will not get credit for them in performance tables. This is because we want to ensure pupils benefit from reformed 9-to-1 GCSEs, which are the gold standard qualification at 16, in line with expected standards in countries with high performing education systems.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9383adb7e707b328b0f7373a2e958f4274a44e8c/0_240_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8394dbf134191ea5c90dceec10612ed9","title":"massive pumice raft spotted in the pacific could help replenish great barrier reef","story":"The 150 sq km field of floating rock was created by an underwater volcanic eruption near TongaA giant raft of pumice, which was spotted in the Pacific and is expected to make its way towards Australia, could help the recovery of the Great Barrier Reef from its bleaching episode by restocking millions of tiny marine organisms, including coral.The pumice raft, which is about 150 sq km, was produced by an underwater volcano near Tonga. It was first reported by Australian couple Michael Hoult and Larissa Brill, who were sailing a catamaran to Fiji, on 16 August.“We entered a total rock rubble slick made up of pumice stones from marble to basketball size,” the couple said in a Facebook post. “The waves were knocked back to almost calm and the boat was slowed to 1 knot. The rubble slick went as far as we could see in the moonlight and with our spotlight.”The yacht’s steering became temporarily jammed by rocks between rudders and hull, but they managed to clear it and warn other vessels in the area. Since then, the pair have been working with QUT geologist Associate Professor Scott Bryan by providing pictures and samples of the volcanic rock. Prof Bryan said the raft will be the temporary home for billions of marine organisms. Marine life including barnacles, corals, crabs, snails and worms will tag along as it travels toward Australia and become a “potential mechanism for restocking the Great Barrier Reef”.“Based on past pumice raft events we have studied over the last 20 years, it’s going to bring new healthy corals and other reef dwellers to the Great Barrier Reef,” Prof Bryan said.Pumice forms when frothy molten rock cools rapidly and forms a lightweight bubble-rich rock that can float. The pumice raft comes from an unnamed but only recently discovered underwater volcano that satellite images reveal erupted about 7 August. It should begin to hit Australian shores in about seven months’ time, passing by New Caledonia, Vanuatu and reefs in the eastern Coral Sea along the way as coral begins to spawn.“It’s the right timing. So it will be able to pick up corals and other reef building organisms, and then bring them into the Great Barrier Reef,” Prof Bryan said.“Each piece of pumice is a rafting vehicle. It’s a home and a vehicle for marine organisms to attach and hitch a ride across the deep ocean to get to Australia.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa1c4051aaff50e0522304d7a9ff70b1758a6071/0_121_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d093510d460f31e82ea497357f389fc","title":"uk fracking site near blackpool reports largest tremor yet","story":"Cuadrilla reports ‘mico-seismic event’ at Preston New Road facility on Saturday nightA tremor of magnitude 2.1 has been recorded at the UK’s only active fracking site – the largest detected at the facility.The energy firm Cuadrilla said the “micro-seismic event” at its site near Blackpool had occurred at 11.01pm on Saturday.It came days after the previous record was set at the Preston New Road facility last Wednesday, when a 1.55-magnitude tremor was recorded.The company said Saturday’s tremor had lasted for about one second and had occurred when no fracking was taking place.While some local residents may have felt the movement, it was not strong enough to have caused any damage to property, the firm added.“We can confirm that a micro-seismic event measuring 2.1ML (local magnitude) on the Richter scale occurred at Preston New Road,” a spokeswoman said.“This lasted for around one second and resulted in ground motion less than 1.5 mms. Hydraulic fracturing was not taking place at the time.”According to the British Geological Survey, the tremor had a depth of 1.2 miles (2km) and was felt by residents in areas including Great Plumpton, Blackpool and Lytham St Annes.Regulators were informed and the “integrity” of the well has been confirmed, Cuadrilla said.Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at Imperial College London, tweeted: “M2.1 is the largest induced event so far during the 2018-2019 hydraulic fracture operations at the Preston New Road site. It is close in size to the M2.3 earthquake in 2011 at the Preese Hall site which resulted in the suspension of fracking in the UK for seven years.”Fracking was halted temporarily at Preston New Road after Wednesday’s tremor, which Cuadrilla said would have felt similar to someone dropping a large bag of shopping on the floor.Pausing work for 18 hours is the routine response for any tremor over 0.5.Labour’s shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey, has called for fracking to be banned, saying it causes air and water pollution and contributes to climate change.The environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth said that in 60 days of fracking last year there had been 57 tremors in Lancashire, and it could not be carried out without triggering earthquakes.“Even small vibrations at ground level can be the sign of far more damaging impacts deep underground,” said Jamie Peters, a campaigner for the organisation.The government has said the extraction of shale gas through fracking could support the UK’s transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1732f3c562841596c47e4b564f8f380d26e6107e/0_287_2363_1418/master/2363.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cb87bb01fe15fe9428aa1da0e75b758","title":"for sama documentary interview waad al kateab","story":"For Sama, a new documentary from award-winning Syrian journalist Waad al-Kateab, has won global acclaim. She talks about filming and family life on the frontlineThe camera focuses on Sama’s face. She is the sweetest baby and looks, at first glance, as though her life might be ordinary. Her eyes are a transitory newborn colour, greyish green, waiting to turn brown. Her gold earrings look over-large in her tiny ears. Sama means sky in Arabic – a sky, as her mother imagines it, where no bombs fall, with ordinary clouds and sunshine. So far, this is footage that could be the work of any doting parent, but Sama’s mother is journalist Waad al-Kateab and this is her documentary For Sama, filmed during the Syrian war. In the film al-Kateab sings a lullaby that almost lulls us – if not Sama – into a false sense of security. Sama is chewing her toe investigatively, as babies do, when a tank shell explodes. It sounds like a nightmare next-door neighbour heaving heavy furniture about and there is a shout: “Downstairs, downstairs, there’s another one coming…” It is the summer of 2016, the beginning of the siege of Aleppo. The camera loses focus, swerves incoherently. Al-Kateab calmly asks someone to “take Sama”. By now, the shells are deafening.“This is insane – we’re getting this every day,” she goes on in her low, musical voice – her calm as abnormal as her situation (during the siege there were cluster bombs, chlorine gas, barrel bombs and air strikes). There is fire at the end of their corridor and smoke pours in. They live in the hospital that her husband, Hamza, has started from scratch. And now they are moving a baby on life support and Hamza is shouting: “Come on! We need to pump the ventilators by hand.” In the dark, al-Kateab calls out: “Who’s got Sama?”A UN spokesman recently said the world had become “numb to the carnage” in Syria after more than eight years of war and that even the rising death toll in Idlib – the country’s last rebel-held stronghold – was being met by “a collective shrug”. No wonder al-Kateab feared her film – which starts with the peaceful protests against President Bashar Al-Assad in 2011 and goes on through the Arab spring to the sacking of Aleppo by regime forces in 2016 – would be greeted with indifference. But the reaction has been unanimous and overwhelming: audiences in every country in which the film has been shown stand and clap (at Cannes in May, they apparently did so for six minutes).Al-Kateab started out as a citizen journalist for Channel 4 news and has already been acclaimed for her harrowing and human series of reports Inside Aleppo (for which she has won an Emmy and the foreign affairs prize at the British journalism awards). But this film, dedicated to her daughter, is more personal. This is a mother’s film in which the normal rhythms of parenthood become disrupted. Al-Kateab worries that nappies and baby formula will run out. Toddlers use a bombed bus as their playground, painting it all the colours of the rainbow (even little Sama is helped to wield a brush) and al-Kateab’s stoical best friend Afraa never loses the twinkle in her eye as she keeps quiet about weevils she finds in the rice. In the unreality of war, the domesticity startles: an ordinary cooking pot looks outlandish. But this is For Sama’s strength: the tender stuff of family life, often ignored in war reporting, is all there. Already garlanded with awards including best documentary at the Cannes and SXSW film festivals and a special jury prize at Hot Docs, For Sama also shows what it is to destroy a family. We see mothers in fierce, tearless overdrive, like figures from Shakespearean tragedy. One mother searching for her son, Mohammad, gives us the film’s most revealing line. On finding his dead body she postpones the evidence of what she sees, crying hysterically: “It’s Mummy, I’ve got your milk, wake up!” At this moment, she sees al-Kateab filming. What you expect her to say is: “How dare you?” Instead, she screams at the top of her voice: “Film this!”“My lens,” al-Kateab says now, “was, for her, the world outside. She wanted her grief witnessed.”Last week – three years later – a small girl skips along the corridor of a photographic studio in north London, holding the hand of a babysitter. “Where’s Mama?” she calls out. Sama is about to join her mother and have her picture taken. She does several experimental twirls in her flowery frock and puts on her shoes with satisfaction. The moment comes to comb her hair: Mama must do it. Sama prefers not to stand still. Asked how old she is, she holds up three fingers, eyes shining. She is an enchanting child, extraordinarily animated. Her mother, beautiful and immaculately dressed – responding to her daughter at every turn – is still by contrast. Looking at them after having seen the film, one feels a marvelling gratitude that they have survived. It seems bordering on unreal that she and her family have swapped east Aleppo for east London (she is currently employed by Channel 4 NewsITN).The family was compelled to leave Syria on 21 December 2016 (the city’s sixth month under siege). Hamza was recognised – as manager of the only surviving hospital and responsible for civilian healthcare in east Aleppo’s last besieged quarter – to be one of the most significant figures in the civilian administration area and it was he who received the phone call from the UN with a message from the Russians to say that if those remaining in Aleppo wanted to survive, they must surrender and go into exile immediately. Al-Kateab asks in the film: “Sama, will you remember Aleppo? Will you blame me for staying here? Or blame me for leaving now?” They had never intended to leave. And, in one sense al-Kateab (not her real name, she uses the pseudonym to protect her relatives) has never left: she brought Syria with her to the UK, arriving with a dozen hard drives initially cut down to 300 hours of footage – which she then spent two years, with fellow director Edward Watts (an independent film-maker who has made more than 20 documentaries), editing into their 95-minute film.Watching her having her picture taken, she seems professional and aloof – as if elsewhere (as she presumably feels she is). But as she sits down beside me on a small sofa, that changes. Attentive and warm, she pats my arm to emphasise her points. “I filmed everything,” she explains. Selecting material for the film, the challenge was to achieve a balance between “dark and light, life and death”. At first, she had felt adamant that showing the worst was what mattered: her footage was “evidence”. But then, as Watts explains on the phone, they ran an early test screening at Channel 4, for friends and family – “just 15 people or so” – and realised they had “gone too far into the darkness.”Their first cut was in chronological order. It started with hope, descended into despair. This, they realised, did not work. It is hard to imagine more devastating images than those shown in the film, but al-Kateab and Watts insist many were worse – including “a pile of very young children’s dead bodies” abandoned at a hospital. The audience could not cope and sometimes, during editing, Watts had found himself putting his hand in front of the screen. They had to think again. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the Syrian war and more than 10 million displaced, and while audiences needed to be aware of “carnage en masse”, this had not to be at the expense of inidual dignity.The collaboration between al-Kateab and Watts started uncertainly because they were in different countries: she was in Turkey (where her family spent a year after fleeing Syria), he was in London. She applied for asylum in the UK on the basis that she and Hamza were targets for reprisals by the regime and on the strength of their work for Channel 4 news and in east Aleppo. Her story had received attention in parliament during the 2016 siege and with the backing of Channel 4 News, her case was swiftly processed. Making the film, al-Kateab had been understandably nervous that a foreigner might falsify or appropriate her emotional copyright. But nowadays, she happily declares that, while most collaborators “start together and end apart”, she and Watts went the opposite way. It was Watts who had the brainwave to make Sama the key to structuring the film and they discovered that, with a flashback format, they could move between dark and light, with Sama as their – and our – lifeline. And, by this stage, the film was becoming a love story.It begins with 18-year-old al-Kateab (she is 26 now) about to study economics at Aleppo university. Hamza is a close friend but married to someone else. She describes him as having the gift of making her feel safe with “a constant smile on his face”. One of the few doctors in Aleppo who is also an activist, his smile is to be tested in the years that follow. East Aleppo lacks schools and emergency and medical services – thus the urgent need for his hospital. We watch him at work: a confidence-inspiring hero – his makeshift hospital run, extraordinarily impressively, partly on willpower. In the weeks before they leave the country, the hospital (Hamza’s second after the first was destroyed by bombs) performed 890 operations in 20 days and received 6,000 wounded people.One scene shows a massacre in east Aleppo. Al-Kateab films the rows of bodies hauled out of a river – like a dormitory for the dead. Heads stick out of the tops of blue sleeping bags, awaiting identification. These civilians have been handcuffed, tortured and executed. Their crime? They lived in “areas opposed to the regime”. Hamza’s smile has gone but his composure is holding. As corpses are thrown in makeshift shrouds into a mass grave, there is high and defiant singing: “Our dead have gone to paradise.”When Hamza’s wife urges him to flee the country, he chooses Syria over his first marriage. Armed rebels by this point have freed the city but retaliation is intensifying. Al-Kateab’s camera repeatedly shows terrible smoke on the horizon, rising above the city’s brick buildings like grey plumage. She explains that she started filming on a mobile, graduated to a camera and even borrowed a drone from a friend (she had trouble learning to use it but eventually got superb results).Hamza has come up with a rule for the two of them: no crying in hospital. “He explained that people saw me as powerful because I was filming and believed in the revolution. If they saw me break down, however strong they might be, it would weaken them. And Hamza felt he had to have strength for everyone. He was a leader.” Hospital staff used to tell her: “We’re very strong because of Hamza – he is very cool.”But one day, watching an attempt to save a boy’s life, al-Kateab cannot help herself. Hamza ticks her off: “You can’t cry in here – get out.” But then he goes after her. It is striking how often in the film people ask one another: “What’s wrong?” It seems a redundant question, the answer everywhere to be seen. Al-Kateab agrees but explains: “It’s about care. Even though I might know you have lost your child, it’s my way of asking what’s going on in your heart.”Hamza told her: “Don’t you realise I’m in love with you? Will you marry me?” The film answers his question with footage of their wedding: Hamza in black suit and lilac tie, Waad in a veil with white silk roses in her hair. Confetti falls through the air, as though there might still be room for a fairytale in Aleppo. It is one of the rare times the camera is not in al-Kateab’s hands. They dance to Willie Nelson’s Crazy and Hamza tells her: “This is the road we’re taking, it is a long road full of danger and fear but freedom waits for us at the end.” The tenderness of the dancing is offset by what is, in a sense, their most dangerous wedding vow: “Come, let’s walk it together.”In the early days, friends would tease: “They’d say: Waad’s playing with her camera again…” This changed after one of their dearest friends, Gaith – a nurse – and his brother Mahmoud were killed in an air raid. “We had lost Gaith,” says al-Kateab. “We knew he was never coming back to this Earth but had this incredible footage of him laughing, working, sad… the life he’d shared was recorded.” Filming was remembering and the people who once mocked now apologised.Sama’s birth is an ordinary – and extraordinary – event, discreetly presented. We see her friends with ears pressed to the door of the hospital room, listening out for the baby’s first cry and jumping for joy when they hear it. Al-Kateab is then seen crying, holding Sama in her arms – and Hamza teasingly tells her to stop upsetting their baby. What was in her mind? “I was crying because this was a room where two of my friends – Gaith and Omar – used to work before they were killed. I was thinking: I’ve brought life to this place. I’d been terrified I’d not live to see Sama born. I was terrified about the future but also so happy. I could see Hamza’s and my story in Sama’s face. Yet I missed Gaith and Omar and wished they were alive.”If filming was remembering, it was also, crucially, about resistance. Al-Kateab emphasises new media’s role in the Arab spring: “Mobiles became the only way to show the world that we were fighting for our freedom.” Early student protests were peaceful and festive with fireworks and dancing in the streets. But by 2015, the security forces were beating up student protesters. “They’d turn up and five minutes later, the place would empty. A presenter from the official channel would ask: ‘Has anything happened here?’ ‘No, nothing,’ the remaining students would reply.” Al-Kateab’s footage would capsize that lie. Similarly, she would later secure evidence that Assad’s regime was using chemical weapons.Eventually, filming became her way of surviving: “It gave me a reason to stay in Aleppo. If I was killed, I’d be leaving something important behind.” Not that it gave her distance on what was happening. It was “doubly harrowing” and “brought everything closer”. But for many people, the camera represented hope. And while on the subject, I tell her that, strangely, it was the moments of hope in the film that undid me – all the more moving for being unexpected. A woman who is nine months pregnant is carried into hospital unconscious. An emergency caesarean is performed. We see the baby pulled out – lifeless. The misery of it is sickening. War has killed him. Capable gloved hands palpitate the little chest to start the lungs – surely in vain. The nurse briskly brushes his body with a sweeping movement. They hold him upside down and shake and slap and, just as we have given up on his slippery, grey body, he opens his eyes and cries – and everyone who sees it will join in. God be praised! His furious frown is a triumph, his cry defies Assad (they save the mother as well). “It is a miracle,” al-Kateab exclaims. “It gives us the strength to stay in the struggle.”But for her, too, hope is hardest to handle: “Whenever I watch the film, it is when everyone else is laughing that I cry. We were creating hope and it was destroyed by the violence of the regime and by the Russians. At the last screening, sitting next to Ed, I started crying as I watched the early days of the revolution. And he was asking me: “What’s the matter?” And I said: “It’s the hope.”But there has been another, more manageable, version of hope too – in people’s reactions to the film: “It’s been amazing – audiences have given me hope, shown me they really care. I’ve been to Nantucket, Washington, Toronto, and even film distributors, who normally sample a film for 10 minutes and then leave, have stayed and been very moved.” When people went “crazy” in Cannes, she says, “I can’t describe how proud and happy it made me.”It will be years before Sama is old enough to see the film made in her name. Al-Kateab addresses her in the film like this: “Sama, I know you understand what is happening. I can see it in your eyes. You never cry like a normal baby would. That’s what breaks my heart.” Now she confirms that, on some level, “Sama understood everything. That time I was looking for her during the bombing, I found her sleeping in a very quiet way”. Her second daughter, Taima (she became pregnant again while still in Aleppo, the baby was born in Turkey) reacts in a “totally different way. If a bottle of milk drops, she cries. Sama used to fall from a high bed and not make a sound. But I’d sometimes sense she was scared.”After leaving Syria, Sama used to wake in the night screaming. They consulted experts – she is doing better now. Better than her mother, who says: “I still suffer from nightmares. And whenever I hear a very loud sound – like a train – I feel it in my body. I tried to seek therapy but it did not work for me.” She has said in the past that her therapist (whom she now wants me to know is “amazing” and says she “loves”) herself needed therapy after their sessions together.The film’s most extraordinary achievement is that, instead of leaving one helpless, it creates resolve. Everyone who sees it feels the same. Al-Kateab says audiences come to her moved and energised and with one question: what can we do? The first step is “understanding”, she says – especially at a point where Idlib’s suffering is starting to resemble Aleppo’s. And she gets out her phone to play the infamous September 2016 interview with US presidential candidate Gary Johnson. Asked about his plans for Aleppo, he replies gormlessly: “What’s Aleppo?” It was this interview that stung Al-Kateab into making the banner seven-month-old Sama holds at the end of the film with their city of ash as a backdrop. It reads: THIS IS ALEPPO. WHAT’S JUSTICE?As well as the need for understanding, she hopes for support for the campaign she and Hamza plan to launch next month on forsamafilm, to “stop bombing hospitals”. She argues that the bombing of hospitals is now a “worldwide” problem. When Hamza’s hospital is bombed, it is observed with sober understatement: “Targeting hospitals breaks people’s spirits.”Meanwhile, Hamza plans to do a master’s degree in public health and has ambitions to reform the UN and World Health Organization’s approach to conflict areas: “He was put under a lot of pressure by the UN, she says, “to evacuate the hospital in a way that was not to the benefit of his patients. He believes the UN was simply implementing what Russia wanted them to do.”The film has now been seen at the UN and, at a recent briefing at the UK mission, with ambassadors in attendance. The issue of the bombing of hospitals (with the film as evidence) has also been raised at a security council meeting. And it is hoped that For Sama will be shown to the Russian government (although Watts is mindful of the risk that the Russian regime might “pirate, re-edit or misrepresent it”). And might not showing it in Russia be dangerous for al-Kateab? “It would but I don’t care. I could have been killed three years ago.”From an outsider’s point of view what seems most striking in the film – bordering on mystifying – is the intensity of the continuing allegiance to Aleppo itself, the wish, expressed repeatedly, to stay no matter what – a vote to put Aleppo before life itself. One of the oldest and most beautiful cities in the world has had its medieval architecture destroyed by barrel bombs. Wouldn’t you run from the wreckage if you could? A boy, with quavering bravado, says he would stay in the city even if his family were to leave. A girl – no more than three – as she is compelled to depart, says in a startlingly adult tone: “Aleppo is gone.” Al-Kateab lets us know: “Saying goodbye is worse than death.”She nods mutely when I ask if the place itself is precious to her. “A journalist visiting Syria can leave any time. I started with Aleppo in my mind and heart.” She speaks eloquently about shared experience in conflict: “The people I lived with in Aleppo became closer to me than my own parents, sister and brother.” And she makes the point that she and Hamza recognised the necessity of their roles as doctor and journalist.“Death was close. We knew we could be killed at any moment but lived as if each minute was our last. That’s why there is so much joy in the film. When death is all around you, life is cheap but very important. A lot of people in the UK don’t know the value of life. Or the value of minutes. If you enjoy doing something, do it. If you love someone, tell them as soon as possible because this life could end at any moment.” The world, she continues, is a “very dark place – with Brexit here, US policy, Russia – and you feel nothing will change. But if people keep pushing, things will be changed and there will be justice. And we will keep fighting – no matter how long it takes.”For Sama is released in cinemas on 13 September and on Channel 4 later in the autumn.

In his new book, My Last Supper, he decides to cook up a final feast while he’s still here to enjoy itAfter a while you get used to people wishing you dead. In my case it helps that the ones making the suggestion do so lightly. Often there’s the catch of a laugh in their voice. It’s that stifled amusement, the giggle before the darkness, which alerts me to what’s coming. I am on stage in a small theatre or comedy club, the meat of my live show behind me, and I am taking questions. I am working my way from upstretched hand to upstretched hand, trying to be the most entertaining version of myself that I can. “Jay, so… Ha!” Here we go. “What would be your death-row dinner?” The audience laughs. The audience always laughs. By asking the question the balance of power appears to have shifted, and brilliantly. There I am up on stage, owning the space. And now here’s a member of the audience bringing me back down to earth by asking me to imagine I am about to be put to death for some crime of which I am obviously guilty. Then again, they have heard the question only once I have heard it dozens of times. I reply. Some of the audience laugh. Some of them look puzzled. Others look utterly furious. As far as they’re concerned, I really haven’t played the game at all.The idea of last suppers, be they caused by the judicial system, suicide or misfortune of health, has long fascinated me. It seems such a simple question. You are about to die. What do you choose to eat? But it isn’t simple at all. For a start, we eat to keep ourselves alive. That’s the whole point of consuming food. It’s literally a bodily function. But if you knew your death was imminent, the basic reason for the meal would have gone. You’ll be long dead before you starve.So now it’s about something else. Do you choose comfort food, something that reminds you of the good times when you weren’t about to die? Do you allow your meal to parent you, to enfold you in the biggest hug possible? Or do you go for ingredients as statement? Should your last meal not be a time to wade into luxury and excess? And how big a part does memory play in all this? Those of us who are more obsessed with our lunch than is strictly necessary build our stories around mealtimes. We construct our narrative one plateful at a time. What’s more, now we can eat what the hell we like because there are no consequences. Usually, too much deep-fried, sugar-rich food would result in you feeling queasy and worrying about your heart, about what type of person your appetites were turning you into. Now, who cares?But there’s a problem. Let’s call it the mood issue. I am a man of appetites, but even I would be hard pushed to shove the thought of my impending death out of my head and get down to eating. Which is exactly what I tell the people who ask me about my death-row dinner. “I might be a greedy bastard,” I tell the audience, “but even I would lose my appetite if the next morning I was to be the victim of an appalling miscarriage of justice.” They wanted an account of unfettered, careless indulgence. Instead I’ve raised an issue of jurisprudence.In 2007 photographer Melanie Dunea published a book also called My Last Supper, in which 50 big-name chefs from around the world gave an account of what they would eat for their last meal on earth. They were then photographed looking thoughtful about their own mortality. In his introduction, the late Anthony Bourdain, the one-time chef turned writer and broadcaster, explained that these were people who had already had the opportunity to eat anything and everything. You name it, they’d almost certainly been served it. Hence, when asked to describe a final meal, these chefs would probably go after something that reminded them of leaner, simpler times before the glamour and pressure of superstardom. And there is a bit of that. Jamie Oliver chose spaghetti all’arrabbiata. Gordon Ramsay wanted a roast Sunday lunch.But they are in the minority. For example, Thomas Keller, once regarded as the greatest chef in America for his nerdy, intense cooking at the French Laundry, wanted half a kilo of osetra caviar, then otoro, the hyper expensive fatty belly of the endangered bluefin tuna. He followed that with a roast chicken, which sounded rustic enough, but then he went all in with a brie with truffles. All of this was to be served with a 1983 vintage champagne.For a reality check you have to look at the work of the New Zealand-born photographer Henry Hargreaves, an opponent of the death penalty. In 2013 he put together a portfolio of photographs recreating various real death-row dinners. Some seemed obvious. The serial killer John Wayne Gacy, convicted of 33 murders and executed by lethal injection in 1994, asked for fried shrimps and a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh went for a whole tub of mint chocolate ice-cream. These could indeed be interpreted as attempts by troubled adults to reach back to the innocent comforts of childhood.In 2012 the academic journal Appetite published a paper analysing “death row nutrition”. The authors, Brian Wansink, Kevin Kniffin and Mitsuru Shimizu, looked at the contents of 247 last meals served in the US between 2002 and 2006, where the budget for the final meal ranged between $20 and $50, depending on the state. Some states allowed the food to be ordered in from nearby restaurants others insisted it be made from what was in the prison store cupboard.Perhaps unsurprisingly, they found the average meal was a hefty 2,756 calories, which is more than the recommended daily intake for an adult male. The requests from death-row inmates in two states, Texas and Oklahoma, were for meals that were between 750 to 1,000 calories more than in most of the others. Four of them were 7,200 calories or more. (One person ordered a dozen pieces of fried chicken, two rolls with butter, mashed potato and gravy, two soft drinks, plus a pint each of strawberry and vanilla ice-cream.)There are other candidates for last meals. There are the suicidals, like Ernest Hemingway, who went for a New York strip steak, a baked potato, a Caesar salad and a glass of Bordeaux before shooting himself in the head. It sounds like a nice enough dinner, but is it unreasonable to suggest, given what he did afterwards, that this last meal was not an especially happy affair? Then there are the terminally ill. With the moment of death uncertain, timing is an issue, as is the ability to eat. Very few last meals eaten by the dying are like that served to François Mitterrand, the president of the French republic, who died of cancer in 1996. His last meal started with foie gras, oysters and capon, but all of that was merely an overture to the consumption of ortolan, a yellow-throated songbird, the eating of which was frowned upon by the majority of his fellow Frenchmen at the time and would eventually be made illegal.Even in a country that has always been ahead of the pack when it comes to ritualising dinner, the process of eating ortolan goes beyond what is strictly necessary. Traditionally, they should first be placed in the dark for a month, so that, thinking it is their night-time feeding period, they fatten themselves up. Next, they are drowned in Armagnac. Finally, they are roasted for eight minutes, plucked and eaten whole, head and all, the idea being that the sharp bones puncture the inside of the mouth so that the diner’s blood mingles with that of the bird. You are supposed to eat them with a napkin over your head so that the Lord may not see your sin, or so your fellow diners may not see you spitting out the bones. One or the other.Which is more extraordinary: the details of the last meal or the fact that this was the last meal of an exceedingly ill man? Illness murders appetite. Medication blunts and steals taste buds. Entirely reasonable existential angst, a fear of the end, can fill the belly with nothing but lead. The grandiose Mitterrand might have been able to pull off this final, shameless flourish, but I suspect that, were I in that situation, I could not. Indeed, I’m certain of it, because I am no stranger to near death experiences.It is the summer of 1984. I am 17 and alone on a beach in Tangier, on Morocco’s northern tip. The late afternoon is shading into dusk. I came here with six friends, our Interrail cards securing the 48-hour train journey from Florence to a town where impoverished backpackers can afford rooms in a four-star hotel on the beach. I feel intrepid. I have travelled. So why not travel a little more?While my friends explore the narrow alleys behind the hotel, I go alone to the beach. Bobbing on the steel-grey waters a little way offshore is a ing platform. What fun. I would go for a swim, a proper grown-up bit of exercise with a destination. I am 15 minutes into the swim when I realise the mistake I have made. The ing platform is much bigger than I had thought, which means perspective and distance have played their tricks. I have completely underestimated the length of the swim. It is a quarter of a mile from the beach, perhaps more. Currents are pulling in different directions. The waves are getting up as an evening breeze kicks in, and I am tiring quickly. But I am now closer to the platform than to the shore.I stop for a moment and tread water, looking back at the empty beach. Behind it, lights are coming on in the restaurants and bars that cluster the corniche. Life is continuing. Not a soul knows I am out here. I turn and push for the platform, and somehow, 10 minutes later, drag myself up on to it. I sit there shivering, despite the warmth of the North African winds, trying to drag air into my exhausted lungs and looking back at the beach.While I can see the people thronging the front, I can’t hear them, which means they cannot hear me. I look around for any passing boats, but there are none. I have no choice. I take a deep breath, drop off the side of the platform and push for the shore. The waves are no longer a gentle bob and heave. They are peaks and troughs that make the beach disappear from view. I try to focus on the lights, the symbols of undramatic life continuing, but they are rising and falling as I do and disappearing behind walls of water that, at their tops, shade now into a sky fading to the colour of ink.All I can do is kick. And kick. And kick again. My legs are just one long length of cramping muscle. My shoulders are sore and with every third stroke I am getting a mouthful of water. My eyes sting and a nausea – part seawater, part fear – is closing my throat. Now there are only the lights and the surf and the sea and the wind and the salt and the words, “Not like this.” Twenty minutes later, my feet drag against the sandy seabed. Now the balls of my feet are digging in. I can hear the surf breaking on the beach. I crawl the last 5ft, clawing at the sand until I am up and out of the water. I turn and, in the darkness, drop on to my arse, my back to the corniche, looking out at the platform I have come from, my arms resting on my knees. I drop my head and sob.A lot of thoughts went through my head during this experience. There was the slow-motion terror of my fight against the waves. I thought about my parents and my friends. I thought about all the things I wanted to do and hadn’t. However, not once did I think about food. Not once did I think, “If only I’d eaten properly last night” or “If I’d known this was coming, I’d have been more serious about dinner.” And afterwards I didn’t have much appetite either. A real brush with death can impact upon you in many ways. But take it from me – it doesn’t make you hungry.The bottom line is this: last suppers are a brilliant idea, but they are wasted on the very people who are eligible for them. The more I thought about this, the more it seemed to me extremely unfair. I was excluded from enjoying this blissful meal by the piffling detail of not actually being that close to death. And so I came up with a plan: I would stage my own last supper now, when I was fit and well and able to enjoy it. Because this really is the right time. While my own death may not be imminent, I have been forced in recent years to think about my mortality. This year marks my 20th anniversary as a restaurant critic. I have earned part of my living courtesy of thousands of meals, both expensive and less so. I have given my body to my job, and it hasn’t always thanked me for it.But there are upsides, too, not least the massive privilege of having food memories that stretch across years and continents: some good, some bad, some bizarre, all of them perfect material from which to construct a final meal. The long service also means one thing: I am no longer a young man. It is not simply that my beard is the colour of roadside slush mid-thaw, that I am now beyond 50 and aware there is almost certainly less to go than there has been.Both my parents are gone. There is no one else in the waiting room ahead of me. I also have that other marker of adulthood, a family. This is surely the perfect moment in which to take stock. And how better to do so than by coming up with a definitive answer to the question I have been asked, and dodged, so many times? At least this way, when the moment to take my leave actually does come, I won’t be left feeling that there’s unfinished gastronomic business. I will have done the final meal properly.Much more importantly, though, the idea presented me with the opportunity to indulge in one of the rarely discussed pleasures of the table: anticipation. Anybody with even just a passing interest in lunch will have daydreamed about what it will be, thought in detail about the process of getting the ingredients, then preparing and cooking and bringing them to the table. With my plan to build and then serve my last supper I was giving myself the licence to dream. And not only dream. I would have to test and taste and test again. I would need a main course, but also something to start. And something to finish. There would be side dishes. And bread. And butter. The right kind of butter, the stuff you can eat neat without the support of bread. And wine. Quite a lot of wine. Quite a lot of different kinds of wine.But even dreamers need rules. I realised early on that the creation of my last meal would be the coming together of all my memories, hopes and appetites, shameful or otherwise. I was not creating the perfect meal. Perfection suggests balance and poise. I had no intention of being balanced and poised. I would be bloody outrageous and over the top. I would refuse to think about consequences or the next morning, for when you eat your last supper there isn’t meant to be a next anything. In this I would be lying to myself, because of course I would live on, unless something went terribly wrong (or, depending on your point of view, terribly right). I wouldn’t even be looking for the perfect ingredients. They might turn out to be so, but only accidentally. Or because I’m burdened with exquisite taste.Happily, this journey could end only one way: with a set-piece meal surrounded by friends. It would be a major event. After all, how many dinners are there which, through each course, attempt to distil the memories of the person who organised it? Would it be a massively expanded version of Proust’s madeleine, a journey through my life one course at a time? Or would it, like the banquet at the end of La Grande Bouffe, be a complete overload of fat, salt and sugar? Would it, in short, be an obscenity? Or would it simply be dinner? Indeed, is it even possible to capture the essence of one’s life through food?The only way to find out was to start cooking.Jay Rayner’s book My Last Supper: One Meal, a Lifetime in the Making is published by  Faber on 5 September at £16.99, buy it from the  Bookshop at £11.99.

I was really happy with a lot of the football we played.”Emery, who confirmed Arsenal will hold talks with Nacho Monreal in the light of reported interest from Real Sociedad with the transfer window in Spain still open, said he had picked what he considered his fittest squad for the trip to Liverpool. Mesut Özil was again conspicuous by his absence, but the manager seemed to imply he now lacked match fitness. “We picked the squad we thought was in the best physical shape,” he explained. “We lost but we showed some good character.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caf7ffa49c5ca49cd8af87c6066f23cd18045947/132_105_4192_2516/master/4192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df81951950825a2a367df5a14644324d","title":"manchester united crystal palace crossroads solskjaer","story":"After three matches of the new season there is a sense Manchester United must start killing opponents off or risk that confidence could dissipate as performances and results flat-line.The report card for United’s opening 270 minutes of 2019-20 reads: promising yet concerning. Ole Gunnar Solskjær knows his first full season in charge will be bumpy and in the 4-0 victory over Chelsea, the disappointing draw at Wolves, and Saturday’s frustrating defeat to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford, he has been proved correct.Already, Solskjær has to rally his players and turn results around due to the past two outings in which United dominated but failed to win, dropped five points, and so have four instead of a maximum nine.“We have to learn quickly,” Solskjær said after a loss to Palace via Jordan Ayew’s first-half opener and Patrick van Aanholt’s 92nd-minute winner. In between was a late Daniel James equaliser and a tale of a ragged United who could have been awarded more penalties by Paul Tierney, and missed the one the referee did grant, with Marcus Rashford hitting a post, for which he later received despicable racial abuse on Twitter.What Solskjær posits is easy to say, far harder to do: grow up quick, become a streetwise side who take the chances spurned against Wolves and Palace while eradicating errors that had Victor Lindelöf allowing Jeffrey Schlupp to out-jump him, and his centre-back partner, Harry Maguire, slumbering as Ayew registered the Eagles’ first league goal at Old Trafford since 1979.One the plus side for United, though, is a discernible pressing, passing style, and the varying success of Solskjær’s three summer signings.James, who joined for £15m, has enjoyed the brightest start. The strike against Palace came near the end of a contest in which the 21-year-old tormented the visitors. As United became frantic in search of the leveller, it was his calmness that allowed a highly-skilled finish. At his age and with zero Premier League experience before arriving James is a raw talent, yet having also registered against Chelsea on debut and prospered in passages at Molineux his beginnings augur well.Wan-Bissaka, a £45m purchase, has impressed too. Versus Chelsea, Wolves and Palace the right-back illustrated that Solskjær has added a player who is difficult to attack and who has verve when roving forward.As an England defender who cost a world record £80m Maguire is the surprise: the least convincing so far – at fault, in part, for Palace’s opener, and also shaky in moments against Chelsea. Yet he, too, is bedding in and his class will surely emerge.There are question marks elsewhere. In midfield Paul Pogba has the look of man bemused at Solskjær’s failure to acquire a top-class addition to partner him, with Ander Herrera and, less vitally, Marouane Fellaini, departing to leave United light in the middle.If Pogba misfires or needs a rest there is no Ilkay Gündogan, Rodri, Fernandinho, David or Bernando Silva to take over as Kevin De Bruyne has at Manchester City. The hope is Scott McTominay will prove to be near Rodri or Fernandinho’s class as a holding player but this is a big ask and one of the intangibles that place Solskjær’s United at their current crossroads.Another unknown is in attack: there were only three attempts on target on Saturday – the same as Palace. A lack of goals has been the glaring problem since Sir Alex Ferguson left in May 2013. A total of 64, 62, 49, 62, 68 and 65 are their league returns since – a 61.6 season average versus City’s mark of 88.1. Solskjær has already lost Romelu Lukaku, the top-scorer of the past two seasons, and if Alexis Sánchez goes to Internazionale, this will be a further reduction in competition for Rashford and Anthony Martial. There is also the question of back-up for the first-choice forwards: the latter is a doubt due to injury for Saturday’s trip to Southampton (as is Luke Shaw).During the upcoming fixtures all of this will become clearer. At the end of meetings against Southampton, Leicester City, West Ham, Arsenal, Newcastle and Liverpool, the question of which direction Solskjær’s team are heading should have an answer.The Norwegian is a determinedly positive manager. But, as he says, his side have to begin to mature – and soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d241d125666c588b3715deaf8d239a009a09dfc/0_131_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fa74e00ca23d1f5cc3797f4f9a8b751","title":"big four super league barcelona psg bayern juventus","story":"D id you feel it? The great disturbance in the force, as though millions of voices cried out in hope? Last weekend, something remarkable happened: none of the champions of Europe’s big five leagues won (a statistic that admittedly loses some of its potency when it is acknowledged that Serie A hadn’t started: Juventus kicked off their Serie A campaign on Saturday with a 1-0 win at Parma).Last season was the first time that each of the big five leagues had been retained, but here was the little man striking back: Barcelona lost, Paris Saint-Germain lost, Manchester City drew, Bayern drew. Do you hear the people sing?Well, no, not really. The people have been remarkably silent about a weekend of upsets, largely because the people know that it almost certainly doesn’t matter.City may have drawn with Spurs but they had 30 shots (excluding Gabriel Jesus’s controversially disallowed late winner) to three (including Harry Kane’s wildly speculative lump from inside his own half) in all respects but the result it was a performance of awesome domination.Bayern were sloppy in drawing with Hertha Berlin but still managed 17 shots to six. Barça were disjointed and missing several key players in their 1-0 defeat by Athletic in Bilbao, but still had the better of the xG (expected goals). Only PSG, a sportswashing project turned toxic when it lost sight of whose ego it was meant to be fluffing, suffered a defeat that was a clear reflection of the play, going down 2-1 at Rennes. Yet each of the five champions remain odds-on to defend their titles again and the price on all five to do so is somewhere between 6-1 and 13-2.To put that in context, Bournemouth are 16-1 to beat City at home on Sunday: it’s almost three times less likely that a decent mid-table side will win a one-off game against the champions than that all five will successfully defend their titles. Little wonder that the super‑clubs outside the Premier League are beginning to tire of their domestic leagues.The situation of City and the Premier League is a little different to that of the other four. City are dominant because they have an exceptional coach and have invested the resources of their owners with almost unprecedented efficiency (the scale and providence of those resources is another issue).Much the same could be said of Liverpool, their only probable challengers. Both are, of course, to an extent sustained by the grossly inequitable distribution of football’s wealth, an issue that the plight of Bury and Bolton has cast in urgent light, and that distribution will only become more unequal within the Premier League as the new overseas TV rights deal comes into effect. But City and Liverpool are in positions of strength largely because they have got the football side of their operations right.And that’s what is so alarming about what is going on elsewhere. PSG have been distracted by the continuing Neymar saga. Juve have installed Maurizio Sarri, whose idiosyncratic methods do not seem a natural fit to a distended squad built around Cristiano Ronaldo. Barça are in unconvincing transition. Bayern have, in Niko Kovac, kept on a coach about whom nobody, from the club hierarchy to the fans, seems certain.There is reason to be sceptical about all four and yet all remain overwhelming favourites. Barça at least have one rival of equivalent financial might the others dwarf potential competitors, for all that people wonder whether Napoli or Dortmund might have their season.In the past seven years, Barça, PSG, Bayern and Juve have won 25 of 28 possible league titles. Max Allegri was let go by Juve having led them to five scudetti in a row, four of them doubles, because Europe has become the only testing ground – something Real Madrid, whose record of two league titles in 11 years is scandalously bad given their financial advantages, seem to have accepted years ago.Of course the non-Premier League elite like the idea of a super-league, with the proposals to transform the Champions League into four groups of eight, perhaps with protected places, a fairly obvious stepping stone towards that.Historically, there has been a greater fluidity at the top of English football than in any other major league: the top two sides of two decades ago aren’t even the best sides in their respective cities now, a situation almost unthinkable elsewhere.But there is a certain grim logic to a super-league. What, after all, is the point of super-clubs collecting seven, eight, nine league titles in a row, even when they’re not playing particularly well? The Champions League already skews competition because its rewards are so out of sync with what is available domestically. Porto’s defeat in this season’s preliminaries has devastated their financial planning. Or take Cyprus, where no team had retained the title in 12 years before Apoel reached the Champions League quarter-finals in 2012: inflated by the revenue that brought, they have won the championship every year since. Almost everywhere but the Premier League, the status quo cannot hold.This is football in a globalised culture, everything hollowed out to service the elite, the super-clubs from western Europe who draw support from across the world. In the final rounds of the Champions League, the spectacle and drama is extraordinary. But for smaller clubs the future is bleak.Do you hear the people sing? Not much. Not any more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d12380c0d4bec6c1e864f1d9e579bc82a2b5f8b/0_895_8748_5251/master/8748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcfde6be089faf64378c1a26fa0a476b","title":"my concrete jungle home in london","story":"A rundown old school has become a grand home to plants, birds, two dogs – and one artistWhen photographer Steph Wilson first stepped into the south London school that was to become her home, it was a sometime squat, dark and rundown, the walls black with mould. She shudders at the memory. Three years later she has turned it into a grand church to plantlife, an urban conservatory that appears illuminated by stage lights.Wilson moved in when she was 24, after the death of her father – “a bouncer, a drug dealer, an actor – oh, and he was in the SAS”. It was an investment her family bought the place both as a home for Wilson and her many pets, and for the studio space, which she rents out for fashion shoots. The light is extremely soft, the ceilings extremely high – the other potential buyer was a professional trampolinist.When she moved in she ripped up the lino, got rid of the mould, installed heating and a new kitchen, built an aviary for her 12 canaries and four Gouldian finches, another for the parrot, installed a tank for her goldfish and started to accumulate plants. Some came from Conservatory Archives in east London, some from friends, and some from Gumtree, including the cactus that had grown out of its previous home, and which she had to lop a branch off of in order to get it through the door.It’s beneath the hanging baskets, in her living room – “my colonial-style hotel lobby” – that Wilson sits on the antique three-piece suite (“I got everything from Newark antiques fair – all my furniture came to less than the price of my mattress”) with her two dogs, and watches sunlight stream through the glass ceiling. “The grand finale is when the afternoon sun hits the large canvas of cadmium red I hung over the dining table,” she sighs happily. In the back room beside a deep blue sofa, an antique armoire offers a pedestal for her miniature cacti, and some sprout cheekily from the drawers. Every surface contains a jumble of vintage planters containing the next generation of plantlife, pictures and boxes of birdseed.At the other end of the space is the kitchen, where a lone frond of ivy whispers its way towards the hob. Open shelves display a jumble of teapots and cups. The dark green cabinets, made bespoke by Naked Kitchens, reflect her jungle of plantlife, as do the 1970s tiles in the bathroom, laid in the palest of pink walls. A vast studio to the right of the front door is strewn with her canvases and the props from a recent photoshoot.Yet there is not a great deal of art on Wilson’s walls instead, the focus is on the greenery that, as you walk through the cavernous house, feels less like a collection of pot plants and more like pets, or sculptures, or stragglers from a very good party. Beneath the white staircase stands a well-used piano, and the steps above hang with dried flowers. Upstairs are two bedrooms, where leaves tumble from the ceiling. “My most pathetic pleasure was finding a bedspread that matched the plant.”A tea towel-sized private garden is tended sporadically by her mum, and it opens on to a vast communal lawn, shared by a close collection of neighbours, who live in separate buildings that once made up the school. Though a minute’s walk from the front door, the screech and rush of the high street feels far away. Living here, Wilson says, has taught her she’s “good at keeping things alive”. Including, it turns out, herself. She used to suffer badly from anxiety and panic attacks: there was a period, in a previous home, when she couldn’t leave the house. But here, she says: “I’ve created a pod away from anxiety. It’s rooted in escape. All my friends come round and say they’re cured by lying on my rug. The birds are a living lava lamp.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37e330a6f01a0cef623f4bc84eed989b3aa48070/0_136_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc8012ad9050759fa24e08a8bd8b712d","title":"dear mariella frostrup all my friends have babies","story":"It’s hard when you don’t move in unison with your peers. It doesn’t mean abandoning friendships, says Mariella Frostrup, but don’t be afraid to keep a distance when neededThe dilemma I’m 34 and have been in a close friendship group with four other women since university. Our relationship has been a constant comfort, but during the past year I’ve found it incredibly difficult to connect with them as all four have had babies. Suddenly our WhatsApp group looks more like Mumsnet – and I just can’t relate. I don’t know if I want kids or not. My husband puts no pressure on me, but this is bringing out the worst in me. I feel left behind, confused and judgmental as these friends enter motherhood. I feel isolated and incapable of contributing, and when I do I feel disingenuous. I try to widen the conversation, but it always reverts back to babies. I don’t want to lose these people, but I feel marginalised, as if I’m fundamentally missing out on some intensely female purpose. How do I step back without being overly dramatic?Mariella replies It’s definitely a problem. I am sympathetic. But stick with me first, because I have to draw attention to how emotionally over-sensitised we’ve become as a species. Growing up, friends shacking up before we do, marriages and orce, babies born and infidelities committed – they’re all part of life’s rich pageant. Some are profoundly upsetting, some manageably so, and others so natural a part of life’s flow that they should barely bother us at all. Some of these emotional traumas are dumped on us, some committed by us and some are not directed at us at all. In the latter case, it’s generally our own unresolved issues that make us vulnerable to being wounded.Moving in unison with our peer group through formative experiences is something we generally leave behind in late adolescence or, at latest, post-college when we erge on to more inidual paths. In childhood, many of our compulsions are the result of instinct rather than inidual choice. The reason Harry Enfield’s sketch about taciturn Kevin entering his teens is so hilarious is that it’s universal. Each and every child will experience similar antisocial and easy-to-caricature hormonal impulses as they segue from childhood to adulthood.Later, when we “mature”, what we choose, rather than societal expectations, shapes our life as we branch off from friends and family in myriad directions. At a certain point we all have to ersify, embark on independent lives and try to make a good life for ourselves.Having teens, as I do, is a reminder of that early impulse to move as one through the world with our peer group. Everyone is trying to look the same, act the same, they listen to the same music, wear the same clothes and have the same hairstyles. As we become iniduals, with our own ideas and beliefs, insecurities and intolerances, we are released from the bondage of fitting in. You’ve reached just such a stage when adult friends are moving into the next phase of their lives, whether that’s defined by career choices, political beliefs, relationship commitments or, indeed, becoming parents.What you’re entirely right about is that the latter, parenting, initially makes bores of us all. To be in their proximity in the early days requires remarkable tolerance and discipline not to scream out: “Yes it’s a blinking baby… so what!”Becoming a parent is such an all-consuming activity, certainly initially, that most of us do become baby bores – and that’s hard to be around if you haven’t succumbed to procreational impulses. You say you’re not sure whether or not you want children and that’s a choice for you and your husband alone. It may be that you’re just not ready to go down that path, or that parenting simply isn’t for you – so to remain vulnerable to damage from the choices of those around you is unsustainable.My sneaking suspicion is that it’s not your friends’ choices to have babies that’s bothering you but your own lack of clarity on the issue. Bruce Springsteen’s promise in love is equally apt in enduring friendship: “I’ll wait for you, And should I fall behind, Wait for me.” Those we rely on and love will all drift from our immediate grasp at some point and the ebb and flow of friendships and relationships is as natural a cycle as waves on the shore. To fully realise our own lives, we need to branch out and step back, surge forward and move sideways – and for all of us that’s an inidual path complete with distractions and decisions.While your friends are immersed in parenthood and you are trying to decide, don’t be afraid to set your boundaries. Be the occasional voice of reason bringing the wider world into your WhatsApp group, even if you keep yourself at arm’s length. It won’t be long before life leads you back into step, or the road you choose takes you far away into different more stimulating territory.Occupy at least some of the time while your friends are preoccupied by thinking hard about what you want out of your life (and less about what they are doing with theirs). Friends are friends, even when our experiences are at odds, so it’s an imperative life skill to develop resilience and patience for the moments when you slip apart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee81f4de90925ad697bedd90edfbade534cdafd6/0_519_3619_2173/master/3619.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6ebcb955fb203db05b61a65bcce11f3","title":"garden tips from owners of exotic pets","story":"It’s amazing what gardeners can learn from keepers of exotic speciesAs someone who has spent a lifetime fixated on horticulture (as a kid I used to stay up late reading the RHS Encyclopaedia under my covers with a torch), I thought I had a pretty good grip on how to grow plants. But there is always a surprise in store.Two years ago, I wandered into an exotic pet exhibition while on holiday in the Netherlands. I was blown away by the spectacular horticultural installations being made by collectors of poison dart frogs, praying mantises and colourful land crabs. I couldn’t fathom how they managed to create thriving colonies of velvety moss or immaculate living walls dripping in orchids. And, quite frankly, I felt frustrated that I only recognised about half the plants.I learned that, unbeknown to mainstream horticulturists, there is a parallel universe of plant-growing expertise being amassed by lovers of exotic animals. Many of them have little or no formal horticultural or botanical training and yet they have come up with all sorts of ingenious ideas (see dartfrog). These supergeeks not only have their own commercial nurseries for weird and wonderful plant species, but also radically different growing media, planting techniques and even gardening tools. Inspired by them, here are some of the things I’ve learned.It is no secret to regular readers that I love terrariums, particularly the ones that house “Endor” landscapes of miniature mossy woodlands. But as many native UK moss species tend to grow into lanky threads of brown mess in the dark and warmth of terrariums, using the stuff from the bottom of your garden is unlikely to work. Fortunately, this conundrum has been cracked by exotic pet suppliers, who sell at least half a dozen tropical moss species, plus a few temperate ones, that will stay as neat, ground-hugging mats even indoors. I also became fascinated by the use of solid growing media, such as tree fern trunks, to create living walls, posts and pillars, even sculptures. Plants can be attached to these fibrous substrates by simply tucking their roots into cracks and crevices or by tying or even gluing them in place. If kept consistently moist, they will root and quickly clothe the 3D landscape in green. Many suppliers sell the stuff in every shape and size, but I recommend Moss on Treefern (frogsandmore.nlmoss). It has a transparent supply chain and sustainability certification.The best discovery, however, were the plants themselves. Fancy a range of tiny orchids where the whole plant would fit on your fingertip? Maybe an iridescent spikemoss that shimmers like a butterfly’s wing? How about bromeliads in Avatar colours, sizes and shapes that you’ve never seen before? The only place to find this treasure trove of great vivarium plants is not from garden centres, but from shops selling supplies for animals (try dutchrana.nl). Discovering the work of these plant geeks was a revelation – like making first contact with a long, lost civilisation with new ideas and technology.

You enter through a vestibule clad in blue velvet and covered in gilt frames bursting with fake flowers. The ceiling is painted like the night sky. Above a koi pond in the living area, a narrow staircase spirals six feet up towards a giant, pillow-lagged birdcage that probably has the best view in the city. Later, Swift will tell me she needs metaphors “to understand anything that happens to me”, and the birdcage defies you not to interpret it as a pointed comment on the contradictions of stardom.Swift, wearing pale jeans and dip-dyed shirt, her sandy hair tied in a blue scrunchie, leads the way up the staircase to show me the view. The decor hasn’t changed since she bought this place in 2009, when she was 19. “All of these high rises are new since then,” she says, gesturing at the squat glass structures and cranes. Meanwhile her oven is still covered in stickers, more teenage diary than adult appliance.Now 29, she has spent much of the past three years living quietly in London with her boyfriend, actor Joe Alwyn, making the penthouse a kind of time capsule, a monument to youthful naivety given an unlimited budget – the years when she sang about Romeo and Juliet and wore ballgowns to awards shows before she moved to New York and honed her slick, self-mythologising pop.It is mid-August. This is Swift’s first UK interview in more than three years, and she seems nervous: neither presidential nor goofy (her usual defaults), but quick with a tongue-out “ugh” of regret or frustration as she picks at her glittery purple nails. We climb down from the birdcage to sit by the pond, and when the conversation turns to 2016, the year the wheels came off for her, Swift stiffens as if driving over a mile of speed bumps. After a series of bruising public spats (with Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj) in 2015, there was a high-profile standoff with Kanye West. The news that she was in a relationship with actor Tom Hiddleston, which leaked soon after, was widely dismissed as a ersionary tactic. Meanwhile, Swift went to court to prosecute a sexual assault claim, and faced a furious backlash when she failed to endorse a candidate in the 2016 presidential election, allowing the alt-right to adopt her as their “Aryan princess”.Her critics assumed she cared only about the bottom line. The reality, Swift says, is that she was totally broken. “Every domino fell,” she says bitterly. “It became really terrifying for anyone to even know where I was. And I felt completely incapable of doing or saying anything publicly, at all. Even about my music. I always said I wouldn’t talk about what was happening personally, because that was a personal time.” She won’t get into specifics. “I just need some things that are mine,” she despairs. “Just some things.”A year later, in 2017, Swift released her album Reputation, half high-camp heel turn, drawing on hip-hop and vaudeville (the brilliantly hammy Look What You Made Me Do), half stunned appreciation that her nascent relationship with Alwyn had weathered the storm (the soft, sensual pop of songs Delicate and Dress).Her new album, Lover, her seventh, was released yesterday. It’s much lighter than Reputation: Swift likens writing it to feeling like “I could take a full deep breath again”. Much of it is about Alwyn: the Galway Girl-ish track London Boy lists their favourite city haunts and her newfound appreciation of watching rugby in the pub with his uni mates on the ruminative Afterglow, she asks him to forgive her anxious tendency to assume the worst.While she has always written about relationships, they were either teenage fantasy or a postmortem on a high-profile breakup, with exes such as Jake Gyllenhaal and Harry Styles. But she and Alwyn have seldom been pictured together, and their relationship is the only other thing she won’t talk about. “I’ve learned that if I do, people think it’s up for discussion, and our relationship isn’t up for discussion,” she says, laughing after I attempt a stealthy angle. “If you and I were having a glass of wine right now, we’d be talking about it – but it’s just that it goes out into the world. That’s where the boundary is, and that’s where my life has become manageable. I really want to keep it feeling manageable.”Meanwhile, her recent single You Need To Calm Down admonished homophobes and namechecked US LGBTQ rights organisation Glaad (which then saw increased donations). Swift filled her video with cameos from queer stars such as Ellen DeGeneres and Queen singer Adam Lambert, and capped it with a call to sign her petition in support of the Equality Act, which if passed would prohibit gender- and sexuality-based discrimination in the US. A video of Polish LGBTQ fans miming the track in defiance of their government’s homophobic agenda went viral. But Swift was accused of “queerbaiting” and bandwagon-jumping. You can see how she might find it hard to work out what, exactly, people want from her.It was girlhood that made Swift a multimillionaire. When country music’s gatekeepers swore that housewives were the only women interested in the genre, she proved them wrong. Her self-titled debut marked the longest stay on the Billboard 200 by any album released in the decade. A potentially cloying image – corkscrew curls, lyrics thick on “daddy” and down-home values – were undercut by the fact she was evidently, endearingly, a bit of a freak, an unusual combination of intensity and artlessness. Also, she was really, really good at what she did, and not just for a teenager: her entirely self-written third album, 2010’s Speak Now, is unmatched in its devastatingly withering dismissals of awful men.She describes the way she burned bridges in 2016 as a kind of obliviousness. “I didn’t realise it was like a classic overthrow of someone in power – where you didn’t realise the whispers behind your back, you didn’t realise the chain reaction of events that was going to make everything fall apart at the exact, perfect time for it to fall apart.”Here’s that chain reaction in full. With her 2014 album 1989 (the year she was born), Swift transcended country stardom, becoming as ubiquitous as Beyoncé. For the first time she vocally embraced feminism, something she had rejected in her teens but, after a while, it seemed to amount to not much more than a lot of pictures of her hanging out with her “squad”, a bevy of supermodels, musicians and Lena Dunham. The squad very much did not include her former friend Katy Perry, whom Swift targeted in her song Bad Blood, as part of what seemed like a painfully overblown dispute about some backing dancers. Then, when Nicki Minaj tweeted that MTV’s 2015 Video Music awards had rewarded white women at the expense of women of colour, multiple-nominee Swift took it personally, responding: “Maybe one of the men took your slot.” For someone prone to talking about the haters, she quickly became her own worst enemy.Her old adversary Kanye West resurfaced in February 2016. In 2009, West had invaded Swift’s stage at the MTV VMAs to protest against her victory over Beyoncé in the female video of the year category. It remains the peak of interest in Swift on Google Trends, and the conflict between them has become such a cornerstone of celebrity journalism that it’s hard to remember it lay dormant for nearly seven years – until West released his song Famous. “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,” he rapped. “Why? I made that bitch famous.” The video depicted a Swift mannequin naked in bed with men including Trump.Swift loudly condemned both although she had discussed the track with West, she said she had never agreed to the “bitch” lyric or the video. West’s wife, Kim Kardashian, released a heavily edited clip that showed Swift at least agreeing to the “sex” line on the phone with West, if not the “bitch” part. Swift pleaded the technicality, but it made no difference: when Kardashian went on Twitter to describe her as a snake, the comparison stuck and the singer found herself very publicly “cancelled” – the incident taken as “proof” of Swift’s insincerity. So she went away.Swift says she stopped trying to explain herself, even though she “definitely” could have. As she worked on Reputation, she was also writing “a think-piece a day that I knew I would never publish: the stuff I would say, and the different facets of the situation that nobody knew”. If she could exonerate herself, why didn’t she? She leans forward. “Here’s why,” she says conspiratorially. “Because when people are in a hate frenzy and they find something to mutually hate together, it bonds them. And anything you say is in an echo chamber of mockery.”She compares that year to being hit by a tidal wave. “You can either stand there and let the wave crash into you, and you can try as hard as you can to fight something that’s more powerful and bigger than you,” she says. “Or you can e under the water, hold your breath, wait for it to pass and while you’re down there, try to learn something. Why was I in that part of the ocean? There were clearly signs that said: Rip tide! Undertow! Don’t swim! There are no lifeguards!” She’s on a roll. “Why was I there? Why was I trusting people I trusted? Why was I letting people into my life the way I was letting them in? What was I doing that caused this?”After the incident with Minaj, her critics started pointing out a narrative of “white victimhood” in Swift’s career. Speaking slowly and carefully, she says she came to understand “a lot about how my privilege allowed me to not have to learn about white privilege. I didn’t know about it as a kid, and that is privilege itself, you know? And that’s something that I’m still trying to educate myself on every day. How can I see where people are coming from, and understand the pain that comes with the history of our world?” She also accepts some responsibility for her overexposure, and for some of the tabloid drama. If she didn’t wish a friend happy birthday on Instagram, there would be reports about severed friendships, even if they had celebrated together. “Because we didn’t post about it, it didn’t happen – and I realised I had done that,” she says. “I created an expectation that everything in my life that happened, people would see.”But she also says she couldn’t win. “I’m kinda used to being gaslit by now,” she drawls wearily. “And I think it happens to women so often that, as we get older and see how the world works, we’re able to see through what is gaslighting. So I’m able to look at 1989 and go – KITTIES!” She breaks off as an assistant walks in with Swift’s three beloved cats, stars of her Instagram feed, back from the vet before they fly to England this week. Benjamin, Olivia and Meredith haughtily circle our feet (they are scared of the koi) as Swift resumes her train of thought, back to the release of 1989 and the subsequent fallout. “Oh my God, they were mad at me for smiling a lot and quote-unquote acting fake. And then they were mad at me that I was upset and bitter and kicking back.” The rules kept changing.Swift’s new album comes with printed excerpts from her diaries. On 29 August 2016, she wrote in her girlish, bubble writing: “This summer is the apocalypse.” As the incident with West and Kardashian unfolded, she was preparing for her court case against radio DJ David Mueller, who was fired in 2013 after Swift reported him for putting his hand up her dress at a meet-and–greet event. He sued her for defamation she countersued for sexual assault.“Having dealt with a few of them, narcissists basically subscribe to a belief system that they should be able to do and say whatever the hell they want, whenever the hell they want to,” Swift says now, talking at full pelt. “And if we – as anyone else in the world, but specifically women – react to that, well, we’re not allowed to. We’re not allowed to have a reaction to their actions.”In summer 2016 she was in legal depositions, practising her testimony. “You’re supposed to be really polite to everyone,” she says. But by the time she got to court in August 2017, “something snapped, I think”. She laughs. Her testimony was sharp and uncompromising. She refused to allow Mueller’s lawyers to blame her or her security guards when asked if she could see the incident, Swift said no, because “my ass is in the back of my body”. It was a brilliant, rude defence.“You’re supposed to behave yourself in court and say ‘rear end’,” she says with mock politesse. “The other lawyer was saying, ‘When did he touch your backside?’ And I was like, ‘ASS! Call it what it is!’” She claps between each word. But despite the acclaim for her testimony and eventual victory (she asked for one symbolic dollar), she still felt belittled. It was two months prior to the beginning of the #MeToo movement. “Even this case was literally twisted so hard that people were calling it the ‘butt-grab case’. They were saying I sued him because there’s this narrative that I want to sue everyone. That was one of the reasons why the summer was the apocalypse.”She never wanted the assault to be made public. Have there been other instances she has dealt with privately? “Actually, no,” she says soberly. “I’m really lucky that it hadn’t happened to me before. But that was one of the reasons it was so traumatising. I just didn’t know that could happen. It was really brazen, in front of seven people.” She has since had security cameras installed at every meet-and-greet she does, deliberately pointed at her lower half. “If something happens again, we can prove it with video footage from every angle,” she says.The allegations about Harvey Weinstein came out soon after she won her case. The film producer had asked her to write a song for the romantic comedy One Chance, which earned her second Golden Globe nomination. Weinstein also got her a supporting role in the 2014 sci-fi movie The Giver, and attended the launch party for 1989. But she says they were never alone together.“He’d call my management and be like, ‘Does she have a song for this film?’ And I’d be like, ‘Here it is,’” she says dispassionately. “And then I’d be at the Golden Globes. I absolutely never hung out. And I would get a vibe – I would never vouch for him. I believe women who come forward, I believe victims who come forward, I believe men who come forward.” Swift inhales, flustered. She says Weinstein never propositioned her. “If you listen to the stories, he picked people who were vulnerable, in his opinion. It seemed like it was a power thing. So, to me, that doesn’t say anything – that I wasn’t in that situation.”Meanwhile, Donald Trump was more than nine months into his presidency, and still Swift had not taken a position. But the idea that a pop star could ever have impeded his path to the White House seemed increasingly naive. In hindsight, the demand that Swift speak up looks less about politics and more about her identity (white, rich, powerful) and a moralistic need for her to redeem herself – as if nobody else had ever acted on a vindictive instinct, or blundered publicly.But she resisted what might have been an easy return to public favour. Although Reputation contained softer love songs, it was better known for its brittle, vengeful side (see This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things). She describes that side of the album now as a “bit of a persona”, and its hip-hop-influenced production as “a complete defence mechanism”. Personally, I thought she had never been more relatable, trashing the contract of pious relatability that traps young women in the public eye.It was the assault trial, and watching the rights of LGBTQ friends be eroded, that finally politicised her, Swift says. “The things that happen to you in your life are what develop your political opinions. I was living in this Obama eight-year paradise of, you go, you cast your vote, the person you vote for wins, everyone’s happy!” she says. “This whole thing, the last three, four years, it completely blindsided a lot of us, me included.”She recently said she was “dismayed” when a friend pointed out that her position on gay rights wasn’t obvious (what if she had a gay son, he asked), hence this summer’s course correction with the single You Need To Calm Down (“You’re comin’ at my friends like a missileWhy are you mad?When you could be GLAAD?”). Didn’t she feel equally dismayed that her politics weren’t clear? “I did,” she insists, “and I hate to admit this, but I felt that I wasn’t educated enough on it. Because I hadn’t actively tried to learn about politics in a way that I felt was necessary for me, making statements that go out to hundreds of millions of people.”She explains her inner conflict. “I come from country music. The number one thing they absolutely drill into you as a country artist, and you can ask any other country artist this, is ‘Don’t be like the Dixie Chicks!’” In 2003, the Texan country trio denounced the Iraq war, saying they were “ashamed” to share a home state with George W Bush. There was a boycott, and an event where a bulldozer crushed their CDs. “I watched country music snuff that candle out. The most amazing group we had, just because they talked about politics. And they were getting death threats. They were made such an example that basically every country artist that came after that, every label tells you, ‘Just do not get involved, no matter what.’“And then, you know, if there was a time for me to get involved…” Swift pauses. “The worst part of the timing of what happened in 2016 was I felt completely voiceless. I just felt like, oh God, who would want me? Honestly.” She would otherwise have endorsed Hillary Clinton? “Of course,” she says sincerely. “I just felt completely, ugh, just useless. And maybe even like a hindrance.”I suggest that, thinking selfishly, her coming out for Clinton might have made people like her. “I wasn’t thinking like that,” she stresses. “I was just trying to protect my mental health – not read the news very much, go cast my vote, tell people to vote. I just knew what I could handle and I knew what I couldn’t. I was literally about to break. For a while.” Did she seek therapy? “That stuff I just really wanna keep personal, if that’s OK,” she says.She resists blaming anyone else for her political silence. Her emergence as a Democrat came after she left Big Machine, the label she signed to at 15. (They are now at loggerheads after label head Scott Borchetta sold the company, and the rights to Swift’s first six albums, to Kanye West’s manager, Scooter Braun.) Had Borchetta ever advised her against speaking out? She exhales. “It was just me and my life, and also doing a lot of self-reflection about how I did feel really remorseful for not saying anything. I wanted to try and help in any way that I could, the next time I got a chance. I didn’t help, I didn’t feel capable of it – and as soon as I can, I’m going to.”Swift was once known for throwing extravagant 4 July parties at her Rhode Island mansion. The Instagram posts from these star-studded events – at which guests wore matching stars-and-stripes bikinis and onesies – probably supported a significant chunk of the celebrity news industry GDP. But in 2017, they stopped. “The horror!” wrote Cosmopolitan, citing “reasons that remain a mystery” for their disappearance. It wasn’t “squad” strife or the unavailability of matching cozzies that brought the parties to an end, but Swift’s disillusionment with her country, she says.There is a smart song about this on the new album – the track that should have been the first single, instead of the cartoonish ME!. Miss Americana And The Heartbreak Prince is a forlorn, gothic ballad in the vein of Lana Del Rey that uses high-school imagery to dismantle American nationalism: “The whole school is rolling fake diceYou play stupid gamesYou win stupid prizes,” she sings with disdain. “Boys will be boys thenWhere are the wise men?”As an ambitious 11-year-old, she worked out that singing the national anthem at sports games was the quickest way to get in front of a large audience. When did she start feeling conflicted about what America stands for? She gives another emphatic ugh. “It was the fact that all the dirtiest tricks in the book were used and it worked,” she says. “The thing I can’t get over right now is gaslighting the American public into being like” – she adopts a sanctimonious tone – “‘If you hate the president, you hate America.’ We’re a democracy – at least, we’re supposed to be – where you’re allowed to disagree, dissent, debate.” She doesn’t use Trump’s name. “I really think that he thinks this is an autocracy.”As we speak, Tennessee lawmakers are trying to impose a near-total ban on abortion. Swift has staunchly defended her “Tennessee values” in recent months. What’s her position? “I mean, obviously, I’m pro-choice, and I just can’t believe this is happening,” she says. She looks close to tears. “I can’t believe we’re here. It’s really shocking and awful. And I just wanna do everything I can for 2020. I wanna figure out exactly how I can help, what are the most effective ways to help. ’Cause this is just…” She sighs again. “This is not it.”It is easy to forget that the point of all this is that a teenage Taylor Swift wanted to write love songs. Nemeses and negativity are now so entrenched in her public persona that it’s hard to know how she can get back to that, though she seems to want to. At the end of Daylight, the new album’s dreamy final song, there’s a spoken-word section: “I want to be defined by the things that I love,” she says as the music fades. “Not the things that I hate, not the things I’m afraid of, the things that haunt me in the middle of the night.” As well as the songs written for Alwyn, there is one for her mother, who recently experienced a cancer relapse: “You make the best of a bad dealI just pretend it isn’t real,” Swift sings, backed by the Dixie Chicks.How does writing about her personal life work if she’s setting clearer boundaries? “It actually made me feel more free,” she says. “I’ve always had this habit of never really going into detail about exactly what situation inspired what thing, but even more so now.” This is only half true: in the past, Swift wasn’t shy of a level of detail that invited fans to figure out specific truths about her relationships. And when I tell her that Lover feels a more emotionally guarded album, she bristles. “I know the difference between making art and living your life like a reality star,” she says. “And then even if it’s hard for other people to grasp, my definition is really clear.”Even so, Swift begins Lover by addressing an adversary, opening with a song called I Forgot That You Existed (“it isn’t love, it isn’t hate, it’s just indifference”), presumably aimed at Kanye West, a track that slightly defeats its premise by existing. But it sweeps aside old dramas to confront Swift’s real nemesis, herself. “I never grew upIt’s getting so old,” she laments on The Archer. She has had to learn not to pre-empt disaster, nor to run from it. Her life has been defined by relationships, friendships and business relationships that started and ended very publicly (though she and Perry are friends again). At the same time, the rules around celebrity engagement have evolved beyond recognition in her 15 years of fame. Rather than trying to adapt to them, she’s now asking herself: “How do you learn to maintain? How do you learn not to have these phantom disasters in your head that you play out, and how do you stop yourself from sabotage – because the panic mechanism in your brain is telling you that something must go wrong.” For her, this is what growing up is. “You can’t just make cut-and-dry decisions in life. A lot of things are a negotiation and a grey area and a dance of how to figure it out.”And so this time, Swift is sticking around. In December she will turn 30, marking the point after which more than half her life will have been lived in public. She’ll start her new decade with a stronger self-preservationist streak, and a looser grip (as well as a cameo in Cats). “You can’t micromanage life, it turns out,” she says, drily.When Swift finally answered my question about the moment she would choose in the VH1 Behind The Music episode about herself, the one where her career turned, she said she hoped it wouldn’t focus on her “apocalypse” summer of 2016. “Maybe this is wishful thinking,” she said, “but I’d like to think it would be in a couple of years.” It’s funny to hear her hope that the worst is still to come while sitting in her fairytale living room, the cats pacing: a pragmatist at odds with her romantic monument to teenage dreams.

The study concluded that elite athletes had poor oral health despite efforts to care for their teeth.Previous findings have suggested elite athletes may have a higher risk of oral disease because of having a dry mouth during intensive training.Dr Julie Gallagher, from the institute, said: “We found that a majority of the athletes in our survey already have good oral health-related habits in as much as they brush their teeth twice a day, visit the dentist regularly, don’t smoke and have a healthy general diet.“However, they use sports drinks, energy gels and bars frequently during training and competition the sugar in these products increases the risk of tooth decay and the acidity of them increases the risk of erosion. This could be contributing to the high levels of tooth decay and acid erosion we saw during the dental check-ups.”Gallagher said the athletes interviewed for the study were willing to consider behaviour changes, such as additional fluoride use from mouthwash, more frequent dental visits and reducing their intake of sports drinks, to improve oral health.Researchers went on to work with the elite athletes and their support team members to design an oral health intervention study."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

It’s taken the joy out of this game.”He added: “The only way forward for me is to remove myself from football.”One of the most highly touted amateur prospects of his generation, Luck was chosen with the No 1 overall pick in the 2012 NFL draft as the Colts’ successor to Peyton Manning following a decorated collegiate career at Stanford University.The son of former Houston Oilers quarterback Oliver Luck immediately delivered on his promise, leading Indianapolis to the playoffs in each of his first three seasons without missing a start, including a 2014 campaign where he threw a league-best 40 touchdown passes while helming the Colts to the AFC championship game.But an injury to his throwing shoulder during the opening month of the 2015 season was the first of many woes that would come to compromise Luck’s fitness, including a lacerated kidney and a partially torn abdominal muscle later that year which ended his season. That didn’t stop the Colts from signing Luck that summer to a six-year extension worth $140m, including $87m guaranteed, to make him the highest paid player in the NFL at the time.After undergoing surgery on the shoulder ahead of the 2017 season, Luck was held out the entire year as the Colts slumped to 4-12 mostly with back-up quarterback Jacoby Brissett under center. Luck returned to play all 16 games in 2018, passing for 4,593 yards and 39 touchdowns to win the league’s Comeback Player of the Year award, but he’d been sidelined throughout the 2019 preseason with a mysterious leg ailment.“For the last four years I’ve been in this cycle of injury-pain-rehab, injury-pain-rehab that’s been unceasing and unrelenting, both in-season and in the offseason,” Luck said on Saturday. “I don’t know if there was a final straw, per se. The lack of progress, I think, just builds up. I can’t remember if there was one thing that (was) a tipping point or a final straw. I feel so much clarity and again so grateful for the experiences and the positive times that I have had here.”Brissett, who joined the Colts from the New England Patriots in 2017, will be expected to start for Indianapolis when they open their regular season on 8 September at the Los Angeles Chargers.Luck, who watched his team’s 27-17 loss to Chicago from the sidelines on Saturday night, left the field at Lucas Oil Stadium for the final time to a cascade of boos from a home crowd who had become aware of the news as the game took place.“I’d be lying if I said I didn’t hear it,” he said. “It hurt.”Even considering Luck’s accumulating injuries, the star quarterback’s retirement is perhaps the most shocking in NFL history since Barry Sanders abruptly walked away from the Detroit Lions before the 1999 season while still in his prime and within striking distance of the career rushing record.Luck, who turns 30 next month, finishes his career with 2,000 completions, 3,290 attempts and 23,671 yards, all third in the AFC South club’s 67-year history only to Manning and Johnny Unitas. His 171 touchdown passes in the six seasons he played are the second most in NFL history over a player’s first six seasons after Dan Marino (196).“This is not an easy decision,” he said. “It’s the hardest decision of my life.

That makes a difference!He pushes another single to point, before Paine fumbles a bye from the final ball of the over. 62 runs added since the new ball.Romeo emails in: “A quarter of today’s target for England in 80 minutes, for one seventh of Australia’s. Australia’s bowlers haven’t (or didn’t) serve up any bad balls for the batsmen to punish, so they blocked and left, and did so very well. In the last three overs or so, it seems to be slightly squirting England’s way. All that said, another two great deliveries and it all changes.”89th over: England 220-4 (Stokes 23, Bairstow 26) Pattinson is hitting 90 miles an hour consistently now. Most of the time it looks good, right on the off stump of Stokes and shaping. Then it looks bad, when he slips too wide and Stokes plays his best shot of the innings, a dominant cut shot for four! Through cover point, up high, right on top of it, and hit with a sashaying bat for extra style points. What a shot, and the crowd noise booms again. This is some atmosphere.88th over: England 215-4 (Stokes 18, Bairstow 26) Time to calm down a bit. The England pair are both very watchful against Hazlewood, who does look the biggest threat. His accuracy, his bit of seam movement. A Stokes single gets Bairstow on strike, who edges streakily away for a couple more runs. 87th over: England 212-4 (Stokes 17, Bairstow 24) Pattinson, to Bairstow, and he drives hard at a wide ball, so wide he has one hand off the bat as he slices through point. Two runs. Pattinson hoops a couple, then loses his line down the leg side! Four leg byes. The runs keep coming. What’s this though? What’s this? Pattinson has lost it wildly! He bowls a Harmison ball. Not quite that bad, because it swung a mile. But it starts wide and goes wider, literally to first slip, and it dips on Warner who is leaping across but can’t get down far enough, and it sneaks under his fingertips for extras! It’s called wide, so five wides added to the total.What on earth. Pattinson finishes the over on the pads, and Bairstow clips two more runs. That’s 13 off the over, most of them extras, and this pair have added ... I think it’s 53 from 57 balls. The Western Terrace is losing it. What a change in mood, and what a passage of play.We’re under 150, it’s 147 to win.86th over: England 199-4 (Stokes 17, Bairstow 20) Hazlewood pitching up, and being driven again. This time bang straight by Bairstow for four! Stokes follows up with a similar shot for two, the bat twisting a bit in his hands to dampen some of the power. The deficit is down to 160. If this pair do a bit of what they did at Lord’s, things could get interesting. Woakes apparently doesn’t bowl in this team anymore but his batting could then get useful. Hmmm.85th over: England 192-4 (Stokes 15, Bairstow 15) Cummins continues to Stokes, and gets clobbered! That was streaky as Canadian bacon, but equally delicious to the packed Western Terrace as it flew their way. Cummins loses his line and bowls way outside off, and Stokes throws the bat. Much like the shot that got him out in the first innings, except the ball was shorter. This time instead of the top edge flying to slip, it soars over the slips to third man for four. Cummins goes around the wicket to angle in, so Stokes picks him off for two through midwicket. Apparently we’re having a shocking morning on the typo front, so please refresh your page if something doesn’t look right. Maybe we will have found it already.84th over: England 186-4 (Stokes 9, Bairstow 15) That’s better from Bairstow! Out of the middle that time, as Hazlewood pitches up and gets cover-driven for his trouble. Four runs, but he won’t mind too much if the drive is being played. And you can see why the very next ball: Hazlewood pitches up again, Bairstow drives straighter this time, or aims straighter, but nicks it through gully for a far more risky boundary. There’s another great bit of running to follow, again turning one leg bye into two after he’s hit on the pads. Sharp. England have passed the halfway mark, they need 173 to win, and that’s drinks.83rd over: England 176-4 (Stokes 9, Bairstow 7) One of these batsmen doesn’t look long for this innings. Bairstow has a couple of goes outside off stump and misses, then manages to fend away another short ball from Cummins for a run. Stokes goes from no-shot to millionaire, trying a pull to waist-high bounce and edging it high in the air, over midwicket to eventually land safely on the practice strips out on the eastern side of the ground. Two runs.Pretty much, hey? They’ve never won a World Cup, so that would set this apart from crazy Ashes performances of the past. 82nd over: Engand 173-4 (Stokes 7, Bairstow 6) Hazlewood now, and he starts by barbecuing Bairstow’s outside edge, then goes for the pads. With Bairstow’s high backlift it’s a big ask for him to get down in time to keep those balls out. One bounces away for a couple of leg byes, with the appeal turned down, and another he squeezes out via an edge to the fine leg boundary, where Cummins puts in a brilliant save. Some equally good running on both of those misadventures takes England on by five runs. They just need the 186 to win.81st over: England 167-4 (Stokes 7, Bairstow 3) Right then, now the real stuff starts. And with Root already gone. There’s some weight behind Cummins’ deliveries already, shaking Bairstow’s bat as it gets hit hard from back of a length. YJB gets a run as he fends a ball without control into the leg side. There are catchers in the cordon but not in front of the wicket. Stokes looks a bit more controlled off the back half of the over, defending. 80th over: England 166-4 (Stokes 7, Bairstow 2) Last over before the new ball. Bairstow ticks Lyon off his pads, before Stokes shuffles to whip gloriously through midwicket for four. Billiard-smooth across the carpet. First boundary for England since the 61st over.“As a long time OBOer I am aware that all threads remain open at all times, although England’s ability to collapse means they are often cut off. When today inevitably ends the series early I can strongly recommend you head to the rooftop bar of the Belgrave bar to enjoy the sunshine. You’ll be in a line down the street to get into the Original Oak beer garden and the Belgrave provides great views and beer. You’re cool enough to look them up on instagram I’m sure. As a Yorkshireman living in Belfast the only positive to ending the series early is I’ll no longer be getting strange looks from my colleagues for manically refreshing a  webpage then looking disappointed. All the best, and enjoy several superb pints of Berliner for me.”Was... that email written by a beer garden? Apparently it was written by Thomas Brennan. 79th over: Engand 160-4 (Stokes 3, Bairstow 1) Pattinson pushes up towards the new ball, which presumably now Cummins and Hazlewood will take. A maiden, with a leg bye from Bairstow’s thigh pad, while Stokes leaves the rest.There it goes! The key wicket, the one that both sides’ hopes hinged upon, and it’s come about 76 runs too early for England. The early pace burst hasn’t worked but the change to spin has. Unable to score against pace, Root wants to take his chance against spin. He comes down the wicket, trying to drive. Lyon turns it. Inside edge, must have clipped the pad because it loops up over the wicketkeeper. It should be safe, but from the side of stage David Warner comes flying into shot, hands outstretched, and takes a wonderful catch before he hits the ground. What a way for it to happen. England on the brink, and Lyon goes to 356 Test wickets, passing Dennis Lillee to take his own place on Australia’s list behind McGrath and Warne.77th over: England 157-3 (Root 76, Stokes 2) There’s a run! 26 balls into the morning, Root stands up tall and steers Pattinson into the gully for a quick single. Last ball of the over, Pattinson minces Stokes! Gorgeous delivery. Angled slightly across at the left-hander’s off stump, then leaving him off the pitch at 89 miles per hour. Past the edge by a whisker. Take a moment.It’s the hope that gets England at Headingley... the last big chase here it was Shai Hope, making the second of his twin hundreds for the West Indies. 76th over: Engand 156-3 (Root 75, Stokes 2) Hazlewood to Stokes, and he’s hit! That’s hit Stokes in the grille. Nasty bouncer, Hazlewood has a really uncomfortable one. He’s very accurate with it. Last ball of the over, in which Stokes has been looking to get forward assiduously, including a flick off the pads that bounced just in front of Head at midwicket. So the bowler gives him a short one to close, and there’s an exclamation from the crowd as the batsman’s neck guard goes flying off the helmet in two pieces. They’re designed to detach on impact, but he wasn’t hit on the neck guard itself. Stokes gets the once over and decides to carry on. It seems from Labuschagne’s example that the grille is the best place to be hit, if be hit you must. It seems to distribute impact away from the head better than the helmet itself. Four overs without a run this morning.75th over: England 156-3 (Root 75, Stokes 2) Pattinson to Root, another maiden. Anyone who thought there might be some thought of scoring before bunkering down against the new ball, you were incorrect. There will be bunkering both before and afterwards. So many lost souls needing their TMS link as they drift through the outside-UK world. Patience, my pretties. I should also note that it’s the ABC Grandstand link, as our guiding light Jim Maxwell is a key part of the coverage.74th over: England 156-3 (Root 75, Stokes 2) Hazlewood to resume from the Football Stand end. I like this, he’s the one who knocked off a couple of quick wickets in Adelaide in 2017 on the fifth morning to torpedo some similar overnight English optimism. Good captaincy, he can warm up into a spell and then have a couple of overs with the new ball. Double threat. Stokes blocks and leaves his way through a maiden, and now has 2 from 56 balls.73rd over: England 156-3 (Root 75, Stokes 2) WinViz has been out all night and needs to get some sleep. Good morning from Headingley, the field of dreams. The 404 chase was here, where Arthur Morris made 173 alongside Braddles. The whatever it was chase was here, where Mark Butcher made 173. Is Joe Root going to make 173 today? Probably not. The harsh realist in me expects everyone to be deflated when a wicket falls within the first few overs.James Pattinson takes the old ball for a decent start at decent pace. A couple of yorkers that look hard to smother. A ball just down leg that clips the hip of Root and wasn’t far from the edge. A maiden though, survived. Seven overs till the new Duke.Ok, the battered old copy of Jerusalem is being inserted into the Headingley cassette player, which means it’s time for me to take my leave and chew my fingernails to the quick. Have fun with Geoff Lemon. Send him your emails (geoff.lemon@the) and tweets (@geofflemonsport). Toby Ebbs asked for help and Paul Griffin has stepped up. “Toby Ebbs should propose,” he emails. “She’ll be walking on air and tolerant of his cricket watching. He can simply rescind the proposal once The Ashes is over. Happy to help (I’m foreseeing a new career as an agony uncle of Stalinesque wisdom and tenderness).”Tom vd Gucht is a glass half-full guy - but I get where he’s coming from. “I almost don’t want them to win as it will paper over the cracks that have been laid bare within the England batting line up. For the past couple of years, the team seems to often bounce back and put in a display that just about redeems them after a series of terrible performances. Everyone pats each other on the back and they retain the same squad for the next tour only to suffer some trouncing before doing just enough again to avoid serious changes being made. Even Joe Denly, as resolute as he was yesterday, is still likely to have earned another series based on a 50 despite the fact he seems to flirt outside offstump as often as Vince. If we lose the Ashes, it may be the catalyst for a serious test overhaul with the new coach doing a Fletcher 99 and bringing in some fresh top order batsmen to mould whilst allowing the ODI batsmen to flourish at what they do best.”In amongst all the speculation there’s science. WinViz reckons the match situation is 7030 in favour of Australia. Brian Withington might be on to something. “I may not appear to be the first to suggest that it’s all about the new ball. But I’m talking about the third one due this evening. At current run rates England may be looking at a desperate Aus final fling late this evening and then again (if that’s not contradictory) tomorrow morning. Drama. You heard it here first.”“An excellent initiative for second and subsequent new balls. Some Test-playing nations have even experimented with this for the first new ball, putting in two watchmen at the start of the innings. I believe they’re typically referred to as openers. Bayliss and co might like to try this new-fangled stunt once in a while.” Adrian Armstrong there with a well-crafted email. Joe Root stole the headlines yesterday but Joe Denly performed admirably as his offsider.Steve Smith continues to push for a return to the Australian XI for the fourth Test at Old Trafford. “Morning Jonathan,” morning Damian Clarke. “Les Mis or Les Fat? I’m feeling a bit more Les Big Byrd, “A Little More Numb”.Ian Chappell: “Jason Roy is totally out of his depth opening in Test cricket.” While England search for an against-the-odds hero, Australia can celebrate their own unlikely saviour, Marnus Labuschagne.When he played a first couple of tentative Tests in late 2018, it came off the back of a few years of Sheffield Shield cricket averaging in the low 30s, and a dearth of domestic batting that meant any player stringing together a couple of scores was in with some chance for higher honours.The new ball watchman idea is catching on. Here’s Geoff Wignall: “England will be hoping that Root and Stokes can stick around long enough to deal with the new ball, say another 20 overs. But failing that is there a case for adopting the nightwatchman convention and sending in a newballwatchman (Woakes) to protect Bairstow and after he gets out Buttler, in hope of later runs?”Although Ben Heywood has spotted an obvious flaw. “The problem is, for it to come into effect either Root or Stokes has to get out first, and I’d rather that didn’t happen until about this time tomorrow.”Toby Ebbs needs help. “I’m currently up in the Sierra de Guadarrama, one hour north of Madrid, where the temperature is a much cooler 28 degrees. I’m on a diplomatic rescue mission to reunite with my girlfriend after a ‘time out’ of several months. So that I don’t appear inattentive to her needs I have to avoid the score, bank the OBO feed and then scroll through your reports with a mixture of apprehension and excitement at the end of the day. The only thing is that Friday’s play nearly destroyed me and ruined the mission. I was visibly upset but couldn’t really explain why. What should I do today?”My advice: pour a glass of lemonade and confess that you’re a secret cricket watcher.Weather: We’re in for a glorious summer’s day in Leeds, clear and hot. Is this genius, or have I eaten too many Haribo gummy bears? I keep rereading and it continues to make sense.Joe Root has become the central protagonist in this unfolding drama. As Andy Bull writes, what happens today - good or bad - could well define his captaincy of England. Root has played a lot of international cricket in the last six years: 320 innings altogether – more than any other player – and he has faced almost 20,000 balls, nearly a quarter as many again as two of the four other great batsmen of this generation, Kane Williamson and Steve Smith. Virat Kohli is the only one who gets close. Right now, Root is the only one of the four whose Test average has fallen below the fifty watershed. It falls all the way from 53 to 42 when he has been captain. Root’s game has frayed and worn, Watching his strange field placings in this series, it was beginning to feel as if his leadership was not worth what it costs in runs lost.I like Scott’s approach methodical, like how a batting coach would break down the challenge.Pitch: The Headingley surface has offered something to the seamers throughout this Test but it’s also improved for batting the longer the match has worn on. There are no gremlins for England to fear, although there are growing footmarks Nathan Lyon could exploit when bowling to left-handers.Tor Turner has emailed in, and I’ll paraphrase, because it sums up what the majority of England supporters seem to communicating. We really really really want and hope England to win. But, it’s horribly possible to see them collapse in under an hour. There can’t be many sporting sides around the world where the gap between two credible outcomes is so vast. Nor where that dichotomy is so keenly embraced by the team’s supporters. So, how did it come to this? Let’s turn to Vic Marks for some guidance.When England were 15 for two in their seventh over with another 344 runs required for victory and 70 overs to be bowled in the day, swift exit possibilities were being explored. Now other possibilities, more unlikely but much more intriguing, have surfaced. In their pursuit of 359 for victory England were 156 for three at the close with Joe Root on home turf attempting to play the innings of his life. At stumps he was unbeaten on 75, which already constitutes his innings of the series.“Since we’re talking about unlikely events, there have been two ties in test cricket history and only four higher fourth innings run chases.” A tie! An excellent idea Ian Forth. That results in a super over, right?Michael Robinson touches on the how, not how may. An interesting approach considering so much of England’s difficulty this summer has been attributed to the focus on white ball run-scoring. “As much as I don’t back England today I can’t help but think that if RootStokes, and then Buttler and Bairstow can just keep blocking the ball for two days then the runs will come. Lord knows they got long enough to soak up maidens.”James Roe has joined the growing legion of believers. “England just need to dig in and survive the first 20 overs then the Aussies will start to tire and we could be on for a famous England win. The spirit of our world cup victory and never say die and England can do it!”I can’t decide whether this groundswell of confidence makes me think of Les Mis or Les Fat.“It can’t happen but I can’t stop thinking it might” emails Ben Heywood. “203 runs. 7 wickets left (4 useful). Two days still to play. I know I shouldn’t daydream about a record-breaking, unprecedented comeback, and that we’ll probably be all out by lunchtime....but...but...but...isn’t the mere possibility of the impossible why we watch sport in the first place?” Yes, Ben, yes it is. And reading these emails and watching these dreams shatter into a thousand tiny pieces is why Australians watch the Ashes. Bruce Henderson is steaming in from the Kirkstall Lane end, convinced England are going to do it (with a little help from Steve Marriott), declaring: “For England, this is the summer of all. Not nothing.”Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of day four of the third Ashes Test from Headingley.How are your nerves? If you’re Australian, are you toey? If you’re English, dare you dream? In around an hour from now Joe Root (75*) and Ben Stokes (2*) will stride out to the middle of a field in Leeds in pursuit of the 203 runs England require to pull off one of the most incredible victories in the long history of Test cricket. They have seven wickets with which to complete the heist after suffering the ignominy of a first-innings total of 67. For the improbable to occur all manner of records require breaking. But this is Headingley, the crucible of so many previously unthinkable accomplishments.Commonsense analysis would say Australia are only eight overs from a new ball and their high-quality attack contains four world class, and crucially, patient bowlers. They will have access to a day four pitch that will aid the pacemen with the pristine Dukes and then Nathan Lyon once the ball has aged. No matter how plausible the maths become teams simply don’t chase over 300 in the fourth innings very often. But it is days like today that keep us returning to Test cricket. A day pregnant with possibility. A day that could end with Australians gambolling across the Headingley outfield celebrating the retention of the Ashes or an Englishman or two leaping in delirium with bats raised saluting an unlikely triumph. One way or the other history will be made. If you don’t know the drill yet, I am around for an hour or so to set the scene but as play begins Geoff Lemon will join the fray. If you want to share your thoughts before the opening ball you can reach me on email or you can tweet @JPHowcroft."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fd9bf2feaecaca81c6d1939c2af041299b5bba6/0_158_5624_3375/master/5624.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fe21b52d012344cde38ba248dd3de7c","title":"jonny and the baptists review assembly roxy edinburgh festival 2019","story":"Assembly Roxy, EdinburghAs politicised as each of its predecessors but the musical comics also explore the ineffable mysteries of life ‘As of right now, we’re no longer political.” That’s the conceit of this new show from Jonny and the Baptists, AKA musical comics Jonny Donahoe and Paddy Gervers. They have made their name setting-up (and sending-up) leftwing causes to Gervers’ emphatic guitar-playing and Donahoe’s big bluesy voice – and where has it got them? Or any of us? So instead, they are making a show about love, following the birth of Donahoe’s daughter with fellow comedian Josie Long.That’s the pitch, although you can’t take it entirely seriously after an opener that loudly choruses “you’re either against capitalism or for the end of the world.” There follows a fine, funny song about the unlikely plans they are making to scam the super-rich, and a riposte to Twitter trolls that shut down every progressive gesture with a disdaining “where will it all end?” The show is set to be as politicised as each of its predecessors since Donahoe and Gervers broke through with their Ukip song five years ago. They have some wicked fun here quoting the critics (mea partly culpa), who once questioned whether Farage was a threat. It’s nice to be right, but in this instance, they must wish they had been wrong.It’s only midway (after a showstopper retelling of the biblical story of Abraham from his scandalised son’s perspective) that the gig turns sentimental, with songs about Donahoe’s baby and Gervers’ mum, who died when he was seven. They’re played straight, not for laughs, their respective lyrics circling one another as they conjure the ineffable mysteries of life at its beginning and end.The point is that love is political at a time when acrimony and ision hold the whip hand. That might sound schmaltzy but it isn’t in performance, as a final number reaches for tortuous animal metaphors to express the depth of the duo’s friendship. There’s hard-hitting politics in the old dogs yet, but their new show is none the worse for its soft centre.• At Assembly Roxy, Edinburgh, until tonight. Then touring.• Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be29ef39c690bbf9785ff350bab3a132ba397664/3053_2243_1909_1146/master/1909.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e3dde9dc5e4b13125fa668a1fed2034","title":"sara pascoe i wanted to be prime minister","story":"Behind Sara Pascoe’s wide-eyed and innocent delivery is a knowing and politically savvy comedian. She talks to Rebecca Nicholson about break-ups, panel shows and why there’s nothing you can’t make a joke aboutSara Pascoe’s ludicrously sweet black-and-white puppy is lounging on the floor in front of her. Fresh from a photo shoot, Pascoe is in a shiny dress that gives her the look of a Disney character, albeit one who wants to talk about whether evolutionary biology will ever allow us, as a society, to move beyond shame. (She doesn’t think so the flush of it teaches children not to do something they shouldn’t, so it serves a purpose.). “Sorry,” she says, breaking off for a second. “I’m just looking at my dog being adorable.” He is being adorable. “He’s just having a little stretch. But I think what’s really interesting about politics and the people who are good politicians – and I don’t say this because I agree with their politics but people like Nigel Farage, who’s been an incredibly influential politician, and Boris Johnson and Donald Trump – is the unapologetic-ness. I mean, we associate power or alpha-ness with, ‘I am right.’ Maybe some people grow up with fathers who were like that, ‘Don’t question me’, so we can’t help but respond to men who behave that way.”Those who know Pascoe’s comedy – and now that it has been given the mainstream approval of a primetime BBC2 special, LadsLadsLads, filmed at the London Palladium, more will be familiar with it than ever before – will recognise the way her mind leaps from point to point, skimming like a stone across water before it splashes into a punchline that wraps it all up. Now 38, she has been doing standup since her late 20s, has popped up in some of the BBC’s funniest sitcoms of the past decade (Twenty Twelve, W1A), written a fascinating sort-of autobiography, Animal, that mixed feminism, memoir and evolutionary biology, and made a name for herself as a panel show regular, reliably stealing the show with her erudite whimsy. But this year, particularly, has been her year. LadsLadsLads won her a coveted comedy solo hour on the BBC. And now there is Sex Power Money, her second non-fiction book, which started life as a desire to find out more about porn – she doesn’t watch it – and ended up as an insightful, sensitive study of modern masculinity and sexual economics.It is not necessarily the most immediate material for a comedian, but Pascoe has a knack for artfully juggling the high and low. Unlike most of her peers, she is not going to the Edinburgh Fringe this year. “No, I’m going to Georgia to film a documentary about jobs that are about to stop existing,” she says, because of course, that’s what she would be doing instead. “My thing is, I am a little bit of a silly billy, but I’m much more of a Hermione,” she says, referring to the Harry Potter nerd. “I will fall over if you want me to fall over, but I’d really like it if we actually learned about Georgia.”It is a neat summary of what she does. She refers to her brain as “fizzy” more than once, and though she is more serious and reflective in conversation than her garrulous on-stage persona, she does tend to fizz. She speaks enthusiastically, in great long paragraphs that hoover up ideas from the air. “Since I was really small, my mum says I wouldn’t talk at breakfast because I would just read the back of the cereal packet,” she remembers. “I used to steal from the library, which is a crime and it’s bad, but I just couldn’t get enough books, and I also didn’t like to give them back once I’d read them. I just read everything. I get a fizzy thing in my brain, like a nice glass of wine, and I want to know facts and I want to understand.”She was born in Dagenham, east London, and grew up in Romford, Essex her parents orced when she was small, and her father moved to Australia, leaving her mother to bring up her and her two younger sisters. They weren’t particularly well off, “but not in any kind of tortured way”. She takes her shoes off and points at her little toe. “When I was little, I wore shoes that were too small for me for years, so my feet grew weird, so my little toenails grow and then they just fall off and then they grow again.” One of her little toes is lacking a nail. She points at it. “That’s the only sign of poverty on my body.”She may do silly billy well, but much of Pascoe’s comedy is personal and revealing, and on stage she often gives the impression of a woman who does not know what a boundary looks like. After watching her standup and reading her books, I feel as if I already know everything about her. “Well you do, in a way,” she says. Often, someone will come up to her after a gig and ask her how her mum is. “I’ll go, ‘All right?’” she says, with mock-suspicion. “I’m thinking: ‘Did this person go to school with my sister?’”In LadsLadsLads, which followed her break-up with fellow comedian John Robins, she talked extensively about sex, being single and the celibate year she imposed upon herself after they split. (Robins gave his side of the story in his own show, The Darkness of Robins.) She met her current boyfriend, Australian comic Steen Raskopoulos, doing comedy, too. “Comedy,” she laughs. “Everyone is comedy. There are horrible terms for women who only sleep with comedians. You’ve heard ‘gag hag’, or my agent once called somebody a ‘clown bike’, which I hadn’t heard. It’s harsh, isn’t it?” she laughs. “But the reason I forgive myself is that I used to do gigs seven days a week, I didn’t have a social life, and what tends to happen is that people have a drink after work, which means you’re up quite late with people…”She says she never fancies anyone straight away. “But then you see them for the third or fourth time, and think, ‘Oh I’m looking forward to seeing that person at the gig tonight.’ And also, you get to hear them do their stuff, and they’re either good at their job, which is sexy, and you get to learn a little bit about them, and then there are some people you might think are sexy and you hear their standup and you’re like, ‘Oh my God, what an awful person.’”As Pascoe’s star has risen, she has come to understand the reach of what she talks about on stage. While she is certain that, “Standup is a place where, as long as it’s funny enough, you can say your most embarrassing things, shameful things and disappointing things,” she has learned that mentioning real people has consequences, particularly when she includes her family. “My dad lives in Australia, and my mum brought us up pretty much by herself, but he’s in my life now and I really love him,” she says. Some of her family have a WhatsApp group, and will talk about her TV appearances on it. “And I have the potential to hugely hurt my dad with tiny little asides. I’ll just say this thing about, ‘My dad didn’t love me,’ and it’s just stupid and then it distills back down to this little jagged thing in the heart that you’re nearly 40 and still not over it.”A couple of years ago Pascoe was on the laddy weekend breakfast show Sunday Brunch. “I’m glad you brought that up,” she says, looking entertained. During a recipe segment, host Tim Lovejoy asked what she would and would not use for material. “People… might think you’re trying to make them look stupid,” she explained, before adding, cheerfully, “Or they don’t want everyone to know about their abortion, so you have to double-check.” You could feel the tension radiating out from the screen. “They acted like I’d said I kill babies,” she says now, laughing but incredulous. “Like, I knife them in the head, like I’ll give anyone an abortion who’s watching. I mean honestly, they acted like I’d said something so crude. Part of having it as a human right is that it’s also possible to talk about it without shame. Even on breakfast TV sometimes.”Pascoe wrote about her own experience of abortion in Animals. “One in three of their female viewers will have had a termination. And I really checked myself afterwards, like, ‘Do I regret it?’ But it was just the worst thing I could think about at the time, as in, in terms of if you were going to expose someone.” She laughs. “I’ve never gone on again.”One of the funniest lines in LadsLadsLads has her explaining that standup comedy is: “Just telling other people things about yourself that you should be very ashamed of and them thinking you’re joking.” She is aware of the contrast between what she does now and her early ambitions, which were notably more earnest. Pascoe had no desire to be a comic. She wanted to be a serious actor. She was studying English at the University of Sussex when she saw a piece of physical theatre about chimps learning sign language, obviously, and had an epiphany. She wanted to do political theatre, she wanted to agitate, she wanted to help change the world through art. She laughs. “And I’ve ended up doing silly billy.”For a while, she didn’t even like comedy, though watching The Mighty Boosh in her 20s cured her of her prejudices. “I really loved the ridiculousness of it and I thought it was so charming. I don’t think I realised that adults could be stupid as well.”It was going out with a standup comedian and then breaking up with him that led her to pick up a microphone. “I went to watch him do a gig and it was boys holding notepads being terrible. And I was like, ‘Oh I can do that. I can be terrible with a notepad!” When they broke up, the pieces fell into place. “A broken heart is a perfect time to do standup, because if it’s been a horrible heartbreak, you’re at the bottom of your own barrel. If you go on stage with nothing to lose, nothing bad can happen, and it actually makes you quite fearless.” She also thought that doing comedy herself would help her understand her ex. “And the second I did standup, I understood everything.”Her first gig was to 12 people in Balham and nobody really laughed. “I had a medium-to-bad time. But you get a physiological reward when you do something that scares you. For me, it was this lightning bolt of, ohhh, this is what I was meant to do.” She had been an actor, a tour guide, a backing singer in a hotel near Nottingham for Robbie Williams’s dad, but finally, she had found her calling.“I’d been writing a diary since I was 14, and standup is your diary. You just work out which bits to tell people, but it is your diary. I was like, ‘This is it, it’s like Shakespeare’s time, you’re a one-man band, you go from town square to town square and you lay out your stall and you tell your stories.’ My dad is a jazz musician, and he must have seen me do a terrible gig, because they were all terrible for years, but maybe three months in he said, ‘You’ve cracked it. You’re just going to be you, aren’t you?’”Pascoe has now entered that rare club of comedians who are household names. Partly, it’s because she’s been a prolific guest on panel shows like 8 Out of 10 Cats and Mock the Week. Contrary to the usual line about how women rarely enjoy doing them, Pascoe absolutely loves doing panel shows. “A panel show is, would you like thousands of pounds? Yes please. Would you like to come and sit with your friends? Yes please. Do you want a wine in a mug? Yes please. Oh, buy yourself a new dress, why don’t you? All you have to do is sit there and talk to your friends and then someone edits your worst bits out. It’s like the best version of you on your night out.”She readily admits that, over the past couple of years, her life has changed completely. “Well, you have much more money, that’s hugely life-changing people don’t talk about it very much because you’re supposed to be really embarrassed.” She says she often talks to other comedians about how much she’s being paid, so they can all negotiate better. “Money is so connected to freedom, autonomy, options, owning property. I just bought a house, I can get a dog, so this is the happiest thing that’s ever happened to me.”Having money means Pascoe has time, too, in a way that she’s never had time before. She wants to do an economics degree and she wants to write a novel. “This is going to sound audacious, but hear me out,” she says. “In terms of long-term ambitions, I really wanted to be an actor until I was 40, and then I wanted to write novels, and then I wanted to be prime minister.” She laughs, but she is totally serious. A few years ago, she appeared to be considering giving up comedy entirely to pursue politics instead. “But I really went off the idea of politics,” she says. She grew frustrated at the system, at how little it would be possible to change.Given how on-track her life has been so far, doesn’t that scupper the big plan? “When Boris got in, I started thinking, ‘Hang on!’ Obviously you say stuff in standup and think, ‘I could never be a politician now. I’ve talked openly about having an abortion, or I’ve had sex with loads of people.’ And then Boris gets in.” She smiles widely. “Do you know what? Just don’t apologise.”Sex Power Money is published by Faber on 29 August at £14.99.

While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Update your drinking habits with tips from the experts on enjoying rum’s craft revivalWhile gin has had a dramatic rise in popularity over the past five years, bartenders have been quietly getting excited about rum. It offers huge cocktail variety, depending on the style from the unaged white variety to those aged in the tropics, it’s as complex and nuanced as any other spirit. I spoke to some top mixologists about their favourite cocktails.Jack Wallis and Chris Tanner at the VaultRum cocktails range from the super-simple to concoctions worthy of Michelin stars. Jack Wallis, operations manager at the Vault in Soho, is proud of the simplicity of their Captain’s Blood – a twist on a daiquiri, made with rum, fresh lime, sugar syrup and bitters that’s perfect to serve at home. For something a little more complex, Chris Tanner, also of the Vault, makes a version of Planter’s Punch with orange, pineapple, lime juice, grenadine, sugar syrup and Lugger Rum. Unlike some varieties, Lugger Rum is not dominated by vanilla, aiming instead to deliver a full profile of spices, including nutmeg, orange peel and cloves.Liam Cotter of Heads, Hearts and TailsBarman Liam Cotter, of events and consultancy firm Heads, Hearts and Tails, warns not to take shortcuts in rum-based cocktails: “Inexperienced bartenders may swap out a quality rum with an inferior one and wonder why their grog isn’t quite the same.” Cotter’s all-time favourite cocktail is a Jungle Bird not the original 1970s version, created in the Kuala Lumpur Hilton, but the reimagined New York classic, created by way of Giuseppe Gonzales (formerly of New York’s Suffolk Arms and long-standing patron of Milk \u0026amp Honey). He reworked it to become infinitely more balanced and appealing to a refined contemporary palate. It’s part all-night-fun negroni, part complex bitter daiquiri. He thinks this would be great with Lugger Rum.He also has a soft spot for something more straightforward: “There is something lovely about a simple rum and coke.”Mia Johansson at SwiftLondon bar Swift is known for its elegant and inventive cocktails, and one of managing partner Mia Johansson’s favourites is a Praline Flip. First, they make their own hazelnut orgeat – by heating the nuts in water, cooling and re-blending them – then combine with Angostura bitters, egg, Guinness and spiced rum. Their second cocktail is a little less complicated, but still one I wouldn’t try at home. It’s an espresso martini using Mr Black cold-brew coffee liqueur, coffee, vodka, rich demerara sugar and spiced rum.Thom Solberg at Black RockBlack Rock’s bar manager Thom Solberg loves a Mai Tai. Although this award-winning Shoreditch bar primarily focuses on whisky, it also works with rum. Solberg’s take on his retro favourite uses three rums – Jamaican, Lugger spiced and over-proof – along with triple sec and lime juice. All it needs is shaking up, pouring over ice and a garnish of orange and mint. He says spiced rum goes well with anything apple-y, and that a particular favourite rum modifier is pomegranate molasses. He incorporates this mix into a rum punch alongside dry cider, lime, allspice dram and a little vanilla syrup, garnished with cinnamon, nutmeg and apple slices.Kurt Maitland, cocktail authorKurt Maitland, author of Drink, can recommend something simple and something more showy. A Devil’s Kiss won’t tax you: shake up equal parts coffee liqueur, Grand Marnier and Lugger Rum with ice and strain into small glasses.The Kama’aina is a completely different kettle of fish, however. It starts with ginger syrup, almond paste and pimento liqueur, stirred to create a #9. Next add Rhum agricole, Lugger Rum, guava nectar, real cream of coconut, and fresh lime then shake with crushed ice and strain into a tiki glass, adding Angostura bitters and an orange blossom garnish at the end. Maitland describes a Devil’s Kiss as like an aperitif at home before the main drama of a complicated Kama’aina in a specialist bar. The former can easily be made in quantity for parties and the spiced rum balances beautifully with the bitter coffee and sweet Grand Marnier.Featuring fruit, spice and a genuinely fiery twist – careful with those matchesLugger rum 50mlStrawberry and lime syrup 20ml*Angostura bitters, 2 dashesWest country cider 30mlSprig of rosemarySpiced powder**MatchesStrawSugar 50gStrawberries x10Peeled lime skins (x2 whole limes)Juice of 1 whole limeIn a bowl, muddle all ingredients and leave for 10-30 minutes in fridge, then strain through a sieve.Mix equal parts of icing sugar, cinnamon powder and nutmeg powder.Lugger Rum is a Caribbean rum aged in Devon, featuring sophisticated notes of orange peel, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla.

Bisected by the River Mersey, they are home to at least 67 species of birds, and the rare Daubenton’s bat. During the second world war, mock housing and factory buildings were built of plywood on Turn Moss as decoys to distract German bombers from nearby factories. The area still sports a historic hedge marking the traditional boundary between Lancashire and Cheshire. It was threatened last year with construction by Gary Neville’s Salford City FC, but a local grassroots campaign successfully fought to keep this green space open to all.• visitmanchesterHelen ColleyThe politicians might not be making much use of it at the moment, but Stormont Estate, home to the Northern Ireland Assembly, is a treat for the rest of us. The play park, brainchild of Mo Mowlam, the late Northern Ireland secretary, has swings with wheelchair access and play elements for children with sensory issues. We picnic or grab a coffee from the lorry parked on site. I often join the Saturday park run or use the outdoor gym. Visitors can tour the parliament buildings free of charge and have lunch in the members’ dining room between noon and 2pm. My reliable go-to place for a more hipster brunch or dinner with wine is the fabulous General Merchants nearby.

It was a maternity home during the 1960s and 1970s, and many locals were born there (including me). The house was bequeathed to the people of Dumbarton, but for many years lay in a sad state of disrepair until it was let to a Christian organisation. It runs a tea room on Saturdays (and Thursdays and Fridays in summer). You can walk around the gorgeous grounds or, if you’re feeling more energetic, go up into the Lang Craigs wood for fabulous views. Then relax and enjoy your coffee and cake in the Angel Room watched over by the heavenly frescoes.• visitscotlandCarol Ann RamsayWatchtree Nature Reserve, near Carlisle, offers walks in dense woodland populated with hare and deer, as well as frogs, toads and newts, if you look carefully enough. Sited on a former second world war airfield, it has a number of trails through the woods, as well as smooth track perfect for cycling or skating. It is possible to hire a range of bicycles from Watchtree Wheelers to tour the perimeter, though cyclists aren’t permitted to disturb the peace of the wooded areas. Given that is was once the burial ground for thousands of animals caught up in the foot-and-mouth crisis, its transformation into to a nature reserve, wind farm and disability cycling charity is a serene triumph.• watchtreeJames CartwrightHengistbury Head, just south of Christchurch, is a beautiful, tranquil and constantly changing piece of coastline that has something for everyone. As a newly created dog walker, I can choose from flat grassland tracks that lead to high sand dunes down to the beautiful natural and often deserted beach. Or we can choose to go high on to the head and walk the path through heather and ferns, with views of Christchurch Priory and estuary on one side, and the Dorset coastline on the other. Then, right at the tip, you see Mudeford Spit and its beach huts. There is wildlife and colourful plant life everywhere, and whether it’s sunny or cloudy (it’s always windy!) at the end of a walk you feel better for having been there.• see visithengistburyheadPhilippaBaggeridge Country Park, near Wolverhampton, has always been our family’s favourite place for an afternoon walk. It’s a former colliery with beautiful walks, a play park, a miniature railway, lakes and watercress beds to hop across. It’s often heaving on a warm day, so our best memories are in the drizzle when it’s quiet and we can watch the wildfowl on Bag Pool, or walk to Himley Hall and stop for hot chocolate. You often spot relics of the old mine works and can climb to the toposcope and look across to the old brickworks. A great place to observe all four seasons.• sstaffs.gov.ukColin PearsonBeacon Hill national nature reserve stands above the South Downs in Hampshire. The top of the hill is coated in beech woodland, which provides shady respite from the heat of the summer sun. The chalk downlands are the real attraction though, and you have to be prepared to go slow to appreciate its delights – multitudes of plants, all in flower, just centimetres from each other. The mind boggles at how so many different things can live cheek by jowl. The cherry on the cake isn’t just the song of the skylark, but the clouds of butterflies that erupt with every step. Here I am reminded of Pig-Pen, the character in Charlie Brown, as silver-spotted skipper butterflies surround me in their hundreds.• gov.ukRobFor a slice of serenity in the heart of London, I love Millwall Dock on the Isle of Dogs. Dwarfed by the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf, this expanse of open water is the perfect contrast to fast-paced urban life. Whether it’s observing the mischievous birdlife squabbling over possession of the tern raft in the old graving dock, or partaking in a bracing open-water swim from the Docklands Sailing \u0026amp Watersports Centre, or simply watching the sun set over the City of London with an array of dinghies in the foreground, there’s always something to amuse, refresh or inspire. And for those more interested in llamas, goats and donkeys, Mudchute Farm is just a stone’s throw away.Jack StookesSandwell Valley, near West Bromwich, is a one-of-a-kind place full of hidden gems, with surviving bits of real countryside, open pastures and grass meadows. It also has a nice old farm turned into a museum and two large, well-equipped playgrounds. Or you can visit the priory ruins – said to be haunted – with its Saxon stone coffins, surrounded by old dark woods with hidden medieval ponds. More recent history lies in the second world war ack-ack gun emplacements, still in good shape, but more and more engulfed by the vegetation every year. And an old colliery site has been transformed into a wildlife haven by the RSPB on the river Tame. This is all within a 1.5-mile radius surrounded on all sides by urban sprawl. May it remain undeveloped for ever.• sandwell.gov.ukStanleyMy absolute favourite green space is the Dalston Eastern Curve Garden. This small urban community oasis is set back from the madness of busy Hackney on a disused train line. It’s a beautifully layered garden with a magical wooded area, raised beds with vegetables, and beautiful pots full of seasonal flowers. The main reason I come here is for inspiration – I love the creativity, especially across the seasons. I especially love visiting in October: despite the year growing old, it is transformed into a beautiful autumnal space, using the changing plants, hundreds of carved pumpkins, and coppery red crispy leaf garlands. Sitting in the cold, warmed by a hot chocolate, it is just perfect.• dalstongarden.orgKatherine PhippsWilliamson Park in Lancaster is a gem. Jimmy Williamson (Lord Ashton) commissioned its construction from the remains of the city quarry in the 19th century. Most people who have passed Lancaster on the M6 heading north will have seen the Ashton Memorial in the centre of the park, rising above the trees, but step inside and you find lovely walks between mature trees, a regular outdoor theatre, cafe, wildlife park, butterfly house, children’s play areas and – on a clear day – views across Morecambe Bay to the Lakeland Fells.

There was no information on her current condition.So far in 2019 a total of 16 measles cases have been reported among Los Angeles county residents, and 11 infected people are known to have traveled through the county.The disease was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, meaning there was no continuous transmission for at least a year. CDC officials say the US risks losing its measles elimination status if the current outbreak, which began in October 2018 in New York, continues until October 2019.Symptoms of the virus, which can cause severe complications and even death, include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a characteristic rash which can appear up to three weeks following exposure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e245d887974e9a23cae3f38502cf39394fad488/0_87_5304_3183/master/5304.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1af40afbd74664d4145ceb742ab00e50","title":"nasa astronaut allegedly accessed ex partners bank account while living on iss","story":"Case appears to be first allegation of a crime committed in low Earth orbitNasa is investigating a claim that an astronaut accessed the bank account of her estranged partner while she was living on the International Space Station (ISS).The case appears to be the first allegation of a crime committed in low Earth orbit, according to the New York Times.Anne McClain acknowledged she accessed the account while she was onboard the ISS but has denied any wrongdoing. Through a lawyer she has insisted she was shepherding the couple’s still-intertwined finances.McClain has since returned to Earth after completing her six-month mission.Her estranged spouse, Summer Worden, is said to have filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. According to Worden, her bank account was accessed without her permission from a Nasa-affiliated computer network. A family member also filed a complaint with Nasa’s internal office of inspector general and has accused McClain of identity theft and improper access to Worden’s private financial records, according to the newspaper.Before their separation, McClain had been helping to raise Worden’s young son from a previous relationship and provided financial support. Her lawyer said she accessed the bank account because she was making sure that the family’s finances were in order and there was enough money to pay bills and care for Worden’s son. She was unaware Worden had requested she no longer access the account.“She strenuously denies that she did anything improper,” said her lawyer, Rusty Hardin, adding that McClain was “totally cooperating”.McClain successfully launched on a Soyuz rocket to the ISS on 3 December 2018 and performed her first spacewalk with fellow astronaut Nick Hague in March. She was scheduled to perform a second extravehicular activity on 29 March with Christina Koch, which would have been the first all-female spacewalk but spacesuit sizing issues resulted in this EVA being cancelled. McClain returned to Earth on 24 June.The five space agencies that are involved in building and running the space station – the US, Russia, Japan, Europe and Canada – have established procedures to handle legal issues that arise when astronauts are orbiting Earth.However, Mark Sundahl, the director of the Global Space Law Center at Cleveland State University, said he was not aware of any previous allegation of a crime committed in space. Nasa officials said it was also unaware of any crimes committed on the space station."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2acc02903938e74780ad218781150fd851d5febb/0_427_5104_3065/master/5104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71231aef508c2217c094dbd9d59bd04f","title":"civilians idlib syria bashar al assad total victory","story":"Offensive in Idlib threatens entire region as Turkey fears a new influx of refugeesOne family’s endless horror in SyriaSyrian government forces have made fresh military advances towards President Bashar al-Assad’s goal of reclaiming “every inch” of the country in an offensive that has intensified fears of a humanitarian disaster in the northern Idlib province.Opposition fighters withdrew last week from the key town of Khan Sheikhoun, another strategic concession to Assad and his Russian and Iranian backers, who have torn up a ceasefire deal protecting the rebels’ last major pocket of territory.As the country’s bloody civil war grinds into its ninth year, Assad is widely acknowledged to have emerged triumphant.But the fighting is far from over, with the terms of victory and the shape of Syria’s future still very much in play on the battlefield.Armed groups are dug in across much of the north, including extremist opposition fighters in Idlib, and beyond them foreign-backed fighters including Turkish proxy militias and US-backed Kurds along sections of the border with Turkey and Iraq.Caught in the middle of the fighting, as brutal as it ever has been during this conflict, are desperate civilians. Around three million are trapped in the opposition-held province of Idlib.The area is largely controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former al-Qaida affiliate that came to dominate the opposition after infighting and fragmentation destroyed more moderate groups.But the civilians gathered there come from a much broader range of backgrounds, many of them opposition supporters displaced multiple times from areas that have since fallen to Assad, including Aleppo and the Damascus suburb of Ghouta. Many have fallen under HTS control without actively supporting them.The latest crisis was set in motion in April, when the Syrian government offensive shredded a truce that was agreed last year between Turkey, Iran and Russia. It had created a buffer zone between the last remaining pockets of rebel-held territory and Assad’s forces.The scale and intensity of the bombardment that followed, including attacks on health facilities and schools, led the United Nations to launch an inquiry. It will investigate government targeting of UN-backed facilities and protected civilian sites that were on a list provided to Syrian authorities.Assad claimed that his troops attacked only because Turkey did not stick to its commitments to keep extremists out of the area, which Turkey rejects.Aid agencies say civilians fleeing the military advance face desperate conditions in makeshift refugee camps without water or sanitation, and with shortages of food. With the Turkish border to the north sealed, however, they have nowhere else to go as the fighting intensifies.The Syrian authorities have opened a “humanitarian corridor” for non-combatants to leave, but it leads to government-controlled areas, and few of those trapped see it as a safe escape route. Returnees with opposition links have faced detention, conscription or worse when arriving in parts of the country ruled by Assad’s forces.Khan Sheikhoun was targeted by Assad because it gives his forces control over part of a key highway linking the central city of Homs to Syria’s battered commercial capital Aleppo, and severs an opposition supply route.But the advance into the town deepened the standoff between Turkish and Syrian forces, by cutting off Turkish troops based at one of 12 “observation points” under the ceasefire deal. Ankara said it would not move the site.“The ninth observation post remains in its place. All the other observation posts foreseen or put in place under the Idlib agreement will continue to operate where they are,” said a Turkish government spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin.The effective siege of the Turkish outpost comes days after Syrian government air strikes targeted a Turkish military convoy that Damascus claimed was trying to reinforce rebel lines, killing three civilians and injuring several others.Syria’s government has made no bones about its intentions to reunify the country, by force if necessary. The foreign minister Walid al-Moallem underlined its commitment in a meeting with the Chinese envoy to Syria, Xie Xiaoyan, in Damascus last week. The government would fight for “every inch” of Syrian territory, “in spite of the blatant Turkish intervention”, he told Xie, according to the state news agency Sana.But Turkey too is under extreme political pressure to keep Idlib free of Assad’s control, both for strategic reasons, and because of fear about the three million people clustering ever closer to its border.It already hosts more than 3.6 million refugees, who have become a political liability authorities are trying to close refugee camps and send some of them home.Turkey would struggle to deal with a fresh influx but it fears increasing pressure to open its borders if Syrian government forces close in further on civilians gathered on the other side.Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, will host his Russian and Iranian counterparts for a summit on Syria next month, he announced on Thursday. They will discuss Idlib, but also political efforts to end the war."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/550f97b3455da9957d92ad93e936a884a871ff4c/81_254_2859_1715/master/2859.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c5fc4c5f987d32ae86814cece3eb1f7","title":"far right groups infiltrated uk nuclear submarine crew","story":"Member of Identitarian Movement ‘due to start work on Navy’s nuclear Trident sub’Two members of the Royal Navy, including one who is due to start work on a Trident nuclear submarine, are members of a far-right group with links to a banned terrorist organisation, the Observer can reveal.An undercover informant, who infiltrated the UK branch of the pan-European Identitarian Movement and had access to thousands of internal messages, met a Royal Navy sailor who revealed that he was about to take up a posting on a submarine armed with Trident nuclear missiles.The meeting, involving an informant for anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate, took place at the annual conference of Generation Identity UK in London on 27 July.The Identitarian Movement, which is fiercely opposed to mass migration, has expanded rapidly in the past two years and has at least 63 “regional branches” of varying sizes across Europe.The “great replacement” theory was cited as motivation by the mass shooters in the Christchurch mosque attacks, which killed 51 people in March, and the massacre in El Paso, Texas, earlier this month, in which 22 people died.There is no suggestion that GI UK endorses or supports violence.Last night the identities of the naval recruit and another GI member serving at the same base were sent to the MoD, which issued a statement saying: “Any extremist ideology is completely at odds with our values.”The infiltration, coordinated by Hope not Hate, was abruptly terminated after the group’s alleged links to Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet were discovered. “When we realised far-right activists from a group whose stated goal is the ethnic cleansing of Europe were in the navy, we decided to sound the alarm,” said the informant, who has shared the entire cache of internal messages and planning documents of the identitarian group.The messages show that Generation Identity UK was expelled by the movement’s pan-European network for inviting an antisemite to its recent conference and is now preparing to merge with far-right party For Britain, run by Anne Marie Waters. Prominent supporters of Waters include jailed anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson.The revelation that the far right has a presence in the armed forces follows the widespread outcry last year when Robinson posed for a photograph alongside a group of military figures.The informant, whose identity is being withheld by the Observer, added that the recruit he met at last month’s second-ever UK conference of Generation Identity, held in south Kensington, alleged that his membership of GI was widely known in the service. “He says the navy knows he is a member of GI. He claims all the officers are racist,” said the informant, who spent five months inside the group and officially left it as the Observer went to press.Simon Murdoch, identitarianism researcher at Hope Not Hate, said: “The idea that iniduals who subscribe to the dangerous far-right ideology that influenced the Christchurch killer are serving members of the Royal Navy, and that one claims to be taking up a job on a nuclear submarine, is completely unacceptable and actually quite terrifying. We simply cannot allow this dangerous ideology to gain any traction within our armed forces.”A YouTuber who had links to National Action before it was proscribed as a terrorist group by the Home Office in 2016, spoke at last month’s London conference, although the speech was not recorded, at the organisers’ request. The informant claimed the speaker had also invited two National Front members who were also former members of National Action and were identified by a GI regional leader.Previously, Jacob Bewick, an activist with GI, had been exposed as a member of National Action and was spotted at an NA march in 2016. At the conference, one GI UK member told the informant that two members of the fascist National Front were also believed to be former National Action recruits.While Generation Identity UK disavows violence and neo-Nazism, internal correspondence, sent on encrypted messaging app Telegram, reveals racism and antisemitism. They show that the UK branch has been expelled from Europe’s large identitarian network after recently inviting antisemitic white supremacist Colin Robertson – aka Millennial Woes – from West Lothian to its conference last month.Martin Sellner, the Austrian leader of Europe’s Generation Identity movement, wrote to fellow leaders, that he would “disavow the English movement publicly and declare that it is no longer part of GI, demanding to change its name and branding” after its unauthorised invite to “alt-right YouTubers, whose positions do not represent us”.Robertson has described himself as “pro-slavery” and called for the torpedoing of refugee boats.In June, Sellner himself was permanently excluded from entering the UK by the Home Office, which assessed that the 30-year-old posed a serious threat to the UK’s interests of preventing social harm and countering extremism.Another speaker at the conference was Waters, who has described Islam as “evil” and has attracted 34,000 Facebook followers to her group.Last night, an MoD spokesperson said: “It would be inappropriate to comment specifically on these allegations. We take allegations of this nature very seriously and would always carry out investigations into such matters when they are made against service personnel.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba31fbd60cb0c86100f66e5822d1901f7a7efe39/0_211_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfcb6a87ddbd241b980ade89d99564e4","title":"generation identity uk far right extremists","story":"Encrypted messages show the racist group was expelled from wider European alt-right for its embrace of dangerous ideologiesIn a beer garden in central London last Tuesday the atmosphere was relaxed. But not for Mike. Every few minutes he would turn to scrutinise the people around him. When you have infiltrated a group like the far-right Generation Identity UK, paranoia comes easily.Anti-racist groups have been trying to infiltrate the Identitarian movement’s British branch for years without success – until now. Earlier this year Mike began posting Facebook messages expressing outrage over “the great replacement” – the conspiracy theory that claims white people are being wiped out through mass migration. Soon after, following the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand by an Identitarian supporter in March, members of the group invited him to join.On Sunday the Observer reveals the results of his undercover mission, which was abruptly halted by the startling discovery that two Royal Navy personnel – one of them due to serve on a Trident nuclear submarine – were members of the group. He and anti-racist campaign Hope Not Hate gained unprecedented access to the movement’s social media operation, and exposed the even more disturbing and extreme views being adopted by the far-right group.Mike said: “It was clear that the UK branch appeared to be more open to things like antisemitism than its European counterparts would want.”Mike began copying messages from the group’s leaders on the encrypted messaging app Telegram. Generation Identity’s leaders like to present themselves as clean-cut, but the messages – seen by the Observer – expose connections to extremists.One is a former British National Party official and neo-Nazi called Mark Collett, who has tweeted that a “white genocide” is under way in Britain. Another is Swedish activist Daniel Friberg, a co-founder of the AltRight Corporation, formed through the merger of the National Policy Institute, run by American white supremacist Richard Spencer, and an antisemitic Scandinavian media platform.Other messages show members wanting to connect with antisemites and downplaying statements from a virulent “JQer,” a far-right reference to what they term the Jewish question.This drift even further to the extremes appears to have been noted by Martin Sellner, the movement’s Austrian leader. When the UK branch decided to allow an antisemite vlogger, Colin Robertson, known on YouTube as Millennial Woes, to address its annual conference last month, Sellner expelled the group from the wider movement.Some British members also left in disgust. One wrote: “We are trying to get totally away from the shadow of the Old Right. We don’t do that by getting a JQer to speak at our conference.”Mike quickly learned how the group operated. Its leadership created fake Twitter accounts to write positive replies to their own tweets. New members were recruited by “patriotic” Facebook pages that failed to mention they were run by Generation Identity. Ukip chatrooms were infiltrated. A strategy document called “campaign outreach” listed extremists like Collett as people they should contact to amplify their message.Others included the commentator Katie Hopkins and Paul Joseph Watson, an editor at the far-right conspiracy theory website Infowars.In some messages Generation Identity UK’s leadership described their group as a “water-tight metapolitical project”, their ambition not to win political power but to shape public debate, promoting ethno-nationalist ideas, and their goal the ethnic cleansing of Europe.Traditional far-right discussion of race and genetics is replaced by the language of culture and identity. One member wrote: “Pushing cultural differences is a more subtle way of implying that there’s very real differences between the people who were originally here and the people who are coming here.”The disclosures coincide with a new report by Hope not Hate revealing that Identitarian groups are active in at least 23 countries, making it “one of the most dangerous far-right networks currently active”. Researchers have previously found that 30,000 people are members of Identitarian Telegram groups with 140,000 subscribers on YouTube.France, where the author Renaud Camus coined the phrase le grand remplacement in 2012, remains the movement’s ideological centre. Having originated with the Nouvelle Droite (New Right) that emerged in 1968, Generation Identity has retained extensive links with the electoral French far right, particularly Marine Le Pen’s Rassemblement National (National Rally).Austria is another major player: its Generation Identity branch, led by Sellner, has nearly 17,000 Twitter followers. Police have revealed that the Christchurch mosque killer, who took the lives of 51 people, had donated €2,000 and €1,500 to the movement’s French and Austrian branches respectively. On 19 August, Austria’s centre-right People’s party announced it wanted to ban the Identitarians.Identitarianism is also influential among the US far right with support from Breitbart news, alt-right figures like Spencer and the neo-Nazi website, the Daily Stormer. The American Identity Movement site claims it is “defending our nation against mass immigration”.In the UK, the movement’s expulsion from Europe has prompted warnings that it could become more dangerous. Simon Murdoch, Identitarianism researcher at Hope Not Hate, said: “Evidence suggests we will be left with a smaller but more toxic group in the UK, open to engagement with the more antisemitic, extreme and thus dangerous elements of the domestic far right.”Already a possible alliance with the For Britain political party suggests a new chapter. Ann Marie Waters, For Britain’s leader, addressed the recent Generation Identity conference in London, in a speech billed by supporters as the first “great replacement” speech by a UK politician.Many, including Mike, are worried. “Anti-Islam is now seen as boring it’s moving on to ‘white genocide’, the replacement of whites” he said. “The trajectory is ominous.”Generation Identitarian in the UK claims to be non-violent and there is no suggestion that they have been responsible for any violent acts. Internationally, groups using the GI tag have been active since the 1960s.1968 The far-right Nouvelle Droite (ND) is formed in France.Early 2000s Génération Identitaire, a rightwing extremist group drawing on ND beliefs, is launched.2010 French writer Renaud Camus, coins the phrase “great replacement”.2012 Austrian alt-right activist Martin Sellner founds Identitäre Bewegung Österreichs (IBÖ), a group opposed to liberalism, multiculturalism and Islam.2016 IBÖ members storm a stage in an Austrian university where a play is being performed by refugee actors.2017 Sellner raises more than £70,000 to sail a ship into the Mediterranean targeting boats helping migrants and refugees.2018 Sellner visits Luton, insults Muslims with provocative slogans and is banned from the UK.March 2019 Identitarian-linked shooter kills 51 in mosques in New Zealand.August 2019 Gunman kills 22 in El Paso, Texas, citing identitarian ideas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cff81d5c74da11c2d10e6cedebdf1b8e79c1ec4/77_206_1774_1064/master/1774.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3c4bcf8657c7089aa96f22ec486ba32","title":"kitchener camp sandwich kent german jews haven","story":"Descendants of the Kitchener Camp men rescued from the Nazis will unveil a plaque on war’s 80th anniversaryIt is a near-forgotten chapter in 20th-century history: the rescue of thousands of Jewish men from the Nazis, brought to a camp on the outskirts of the medieval town of Sandwich in Kent as darkness fell across Europe.The Kitchener Camp rescue began in February 1939, and by the time war broke out seven months later about 4,000 men – mainly German and Austrian Jews – had arrived by train and boat. Although the story of the 10,000 Jewish children brought to the UK on the Kindertransport is well known, the Kitchener Camp has received much less attention.On 2 September, a blue plaque will be unveiled in Sandwich in the presence of descendants of the rescued men, as well as the son and daughter of two Jewish philanthropist brothers who ran the camp.Among those present will be Paul Secher, whose father, Otto, arrived in May 1939.“My father didn’t talk about it very much,” said Secher. “I sensed it was a painful subject for him. He managed to escape but his parents and a sister didn’t. The burden must have been immense.”After the Kristallnacht pogrom in November 1938, when Jews and their property were violently attacked, about 30,000 Jewish men were rounded up and taken to Dachau, Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald concentration camps.The Central British Fund (CBF), a Jewish aid organisation in the UK now known as World Jewish Relief, persuaded the British government to admit some refugees. Adult men were brought to the UK on condition they would not be granted UK citizenship, they must not work, and they must emigrate onwards to the US, Australia and elsewhere.The CBF organised transport and rented a derelict army base at Richborough, near Sandwich, to house the men. Their first task was to transform the site into a small town. They built or refurbished 42 accommodation huts, shower and toilet blocks, two synagogues, a medical clinic, a post office and shops. A 1,000-seat cinema was constructed with money donated by Oscar Deutsch, the founder of the Odeon chain.The men were not interned they could request a pass to leave the camp. They played football against local teams, visited nearby beaches, and some illicitly worked for cash on Kent farms. Nine editions of a newsletter, the Kitchener Camp Review, were published.At the time, the population of Sandwich was 3,500. The arrival of 4,000 refugees could have been overwhelming but they were largely welcomed. Hundreds of people attended concerts performed by refugee musicians, and local children visited the camp to play table tennis.The men expected their families – parents, siblings, wives and children – to follow them to the UK. Some women were granted “domestic service visas” enabling them to escape the Nazis, but arrivals abruptly ended with the outbreak of war on 1 September 1939.Nearly all Kitchener men were categorised in tribunals as “friendly aliens”, with the words “refugee from Nazi oppression” stamped on their papers. “Enemy aliens” were interned.After the start of the war, 887 Kitchener men enlisted in the Pioneer Corps. But after the Dunkirk evacuation in May 1940, public opinion turned against German-speaking refugees, who some suspected of being spies or saboteurs. Those not serving in the war effort were interned or deported to Australia and Canada. The Kitchener Camp was closed.An exception was Lothar Nelken, who had been a judge in Germany before being stripped of his position under the Nuremberg Laws and interned in Buchenwald concentration camp. “He wrote a diary throughout the war. I grew up knowing about his experiences in Buchenwald. He never kept secrets, he shared his memories,” said his son, Stephen.On Thursday 13 July 1939, Lothar Nelken wrote: “At around 9pm we arrived in the camp… We were welcomed with jubilation. After supper we were taken to our huts Hut 37II. I chose an upper bunk. One hut sleeps 36 men. The beds are surprisingly good. One sleeps as if in a cradle.”In 1973, Clare Ungerson discovered a plaque in Sandwich, “but the wording was very strange, referring to refugees from Nazi oppression”. The daughter of a German Jewish refugee, Ungerson “realised it must refer to Jews, but I’d never heard of this camp”.After she retired, she researched and wrote a book, Four Thousand Lives, which is being reprinted this month. In terms of the terrible history of the time, the Kitchener Camp may be a small detail she said, “but it’s not small to the many descendants of Kitchener men, who would not exist if those men hadn’t been rescued”.The exhibition, entitled Leave to Land: The Kitchener Camp Rescue 1939, will run until 8 September. Through it, said Ungerson, documents and memorabilia kept safe by families for 80 years “will now see the light of day to tell a story that for too long has been relatively unknown”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/721a80c9e5aa1bfa635b5ff8561251518ce78ee1/0_24_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349a4f8ab4af1a2411686cb46bd6e3fc","title":"g7 the west takes its eyes off africa at its peril","story":"The G7 thought it had solved Africa’s problems, but rising child poverty is a ticking time bombTime was when Africa dominated gatherings of the G7. In the period between two summits held in the UK – Birmingham in 1998 and Gleneagles in 2005 – the talk was of little else. There was public activism and it led to political action.In part, that was because the big developed countries were enjoying a spell of low-inflationary growth and could look beyond their own problems to see a bigger picture. There was the occasional financial panic, but the G7 thought the problems of economic management had largely been solved and all that was needed was a bit of tinkering by technocratic central bankers.Once it turned its attention to other parts of the world, the G7 found much that needed attention. There were initiatives to reduce the burden of debt, to increase aid, to improve governance and to free up trade. It helped that the UK at the time had a prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer – Tony Blair and Gordon Brown – who were committed to the cause and prepared to chivvy along the more reluctant members of the G7.Gleneagles was the culmination of the process. Public awareness was at its height and was marshalled effectively by the development movement. G7 countries talked the talk with a big package of aid and debt relief. Africa, it was thought, was sorted. Time to move on to other issues.As it turned out, the G7 was living in a fool’s paradise. It hadn’t found the secret to trouble-free growth, as the financial crisis that erupted two years after Gleneagles conclusively proved. And it certainly hadn’t sorted all Africa’s problems, even though economic management generally improved and some countries – Ethiopia, for example – grew strongly.The west took its eyes off Africa as it focused on its own problems. China, hungry for natural resources, moved in to commodity-rich African countries and provided infrastructure on a no-questions-asked basis. Countries that were rich in natural resources borrowed in the expectation that high oil and mineral prices would be sustained but, when they weren’t, growth slowed and debt problems resurfaced.Since the Gleneagles summit, the west, for the most part, has become more alive to the risks of global heating fences have put been erected to keep out migrants a meeting of the G7 never goes by without a commitment to keep fighting terrorism.Yet it doesn’t take a genius to work out that escaping poverty is the motivation for migrants to travel to the west, or that the failure of poor countries to provide their young adults with decent jobs breeds extremism. Birth rates are higher in poor countries, with the result that rising populations put pressure on the natural environment. All these problems are particularly acute in Africa.Even the biggest and longest walls in the world are not going to prevent poor people being lured to the west. No amount of security is going to keep societies safe from the young and angry. And any attempts to reduce carbon emissions in developed nations are going to be irrelevant if – as seems inevitable – Africa’s hunger for energy rises exponentially as its population grows.And Africa’s demographic trends are truly scary. Of the 2.4 billion increase in the world’s population between 2015 and 2050, it is estimated more than half (1.3 billion) will come from Africa.New research to be published later this week by the charity Save the Children UK and the Overseas Development Institute thinktank sums up well the risks of ignoring or underplaying Africa’s problems. That, the report says, is precisely what is happening, even though one of the United Nations 2015 sustainable development goals was a collective pledge to eradicate extreme poverty – defined as living on less than $1.90 a day – for all people everywhere.That promise will nowhere near be met on current trends. In particular, it will be broken for African children, with the SCUKODI research estimating that more than 300 million sub-Saharan African children will be living in extreme poverty by 2030.As Kevin Watkins, chief executive of SCUK, notes: “Put simply, the world’s population of children is increasing most rapidly in the region where poverty is coming down most slowly. These trends are unfolding in full view of the governments who have pledged to eradicate poverty – yet their response to child poverty has been a case study in inertia.”The SCUKODI study is pretty unsparing in its conclusions. It found little evidence of African governments developing coherent policy responses to growing child poverty.

Meanwhile South Korea began two days of military drills around a tiny island also claimed by Japan on Sunday, prompting a protest from Tokyo just days after Seoul scrapped an intelligence-sharing pact with its neighbour amid worsening relations. Tokyo and Seoul have long been at loggerheads over the sovereignty of the group of islets called Takeshima in Japanese and Dokdo in Korean, which lie about halfway between the east Asian neighbours in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. The Japanese foreign ministry said the drills were unacceptable and it had lodged a protest with South Korea calling for them to end.Kenji Kanasugi, the director general at the ministry’s Asian and Oceanian affairs bureau, told the South Korean embassy in Tokyo that the island was “obviously an inherent part of the territory of Japan”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Detectives say the 54-year-old was shot at a filling station in Waringstown on MondayInjured man was found by a passer-by in Killinarden Estate after 11pm on SaturdayThis year\u0026rsquos Festival of Nations brings drums, dress and dancing to Mountjoy SquareThe 54-year-old career criminal was found dead in Waringstown on MondayGarda\u0026iacute launch investigation following serious incident at Loughanure overnightClonguish GAA club in Longford extends sympathies to the family of Ciar\u0026aacuten O\u0026rsquoBoyleGarda\u0026iacute alerted at 3am to report of injured man (21) lying on the ground in the townE-cigarettes generally thought safer than cigarettes but long-term effects unknown\u0026lsquoIt would be my plea5ure to have you and your wife 5tay a5 our gue5t5 in the Man5ion Hou5e\u0026rsquoWarm continental air raises temperatures as HSE issues UV radiation warningScientist overseeing HSE fight against CPE warned about declaring emergency overSurvey shows families keeping older relatives in hospital, adding to overcrowdingConcerned among representative bodies about plan to free garda\u0026iacute for frontline dutiesReport finds minority Muslim group faces difficulties with language and employmentSystem for launching small craft found to be in bad repairAssault on Muslim teenager in Dundrum and death threat to UCC lecturer raise concernsT\u0026aacutenaiste to accompany US vice-president on visit to Cliffs of Moher during two-day visitCaseload has decreased every year since the controversial court was establishedJust 127 children have attended urgent care facility since opening in July"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3996653.1566728648!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"g7 leaders agreed on joint action over iran to defuse tensions","story":"US president Donald Trump has told UK prime minister Boris Johnson that Brexit Britain will have a very big trade deal with the United States, adding that Johnson will be a fantastic prime minister. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister Boris Johnson, French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Angela Merkel, Italy’s acting prime minister Giuseppe Conte and European Council president Donald Tuska at the G7 summit on Saturday. Photograph: Andrew ParsonsPool via Reuters  French president Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday that G7 leaders had agreed joint action on Iran with the aim of defusing tensions and opening a new negotiation with Tehran.“We agreed on what we wanted to say jointly on Iran,” Mr Macron told LCI television. There is a message from the G7 on our objectives and the fact that we share them is important, which avoids isions that in the end weaken everybody.“Everyone wants to avoid a conflict, Donald Trump was extremely clear on that point,” he said. Meanwhile, US president Donald Trump on Sunday said he was getting along well with his Western allies at a G7 summit in France, dismissing reports of rifts among leaders as they prepared to discuss global trade woes.The G7 gathering is taking place against a backdrop of growing worries about a global economic downturn and coincides with an era of international disunity across an array of issues that have strained decades-old allegiances.“Before I arrived in France, the Fake and Disgusting News was saying that relations with the 6 others countries in the G-7 are very tense, and that the two days of meetings will be a disaster,” Mr Trump wrote on Twitter shortly on Sunday before meeting British prime minister Boris Johnson. “Well, we are having very good meetings, the Leaders are getting along very well, and our Country, economically, is doing great - the talk of the world!”However, major policy differences over trade protectionism, climate change, Iran and France’s push for a universal tax on digital technology giants clouded the run-up to the summit in the Atlantic coastal resort of Biarritz. Mr Trump arrived in France just hours after escalating his trade war with China in a tit-for-tat battle between the world’s two largest economies that has spooked financial markets.“I am very worried about the way it’s going, the growth of protectionism, of tariffs that we’re seeing,” Mr Johnson said on Saturday.“Those who support the tariffs are at risk of incurring the blame for the downturn in the global economy, irrespective of whether or not that is true.”Underlining the discord, Mr Trump also threatened his host on the eve of the summit, saying the United States would tax French wine “like they’ve never seen before” unless Paris dropped a digital tax on US technology companies.Leaping into the fray, European Council president Donald Tusk, who takes part in the G7 discussions, warned the EU would respond “in kind” if Mr Trump acted on his threat.“This may be the last moment to restore our political community,” Mr Tusk told reporters on Saturday, giving a bleak assessment of Western relations.Looking to broaden the scope of the debate, Mr Macron has invited several African leaders to discuss the problems facing their continent, while leaders from India, Australia, Chile and Spain are due to attend a dinner on Sunday where the focus will be on the environment and other issues.Brexit squabbles Mr Trump up-ended last year’s G7 summit in Canada, walking out of the meeting early and disassociating himself from the final communique having initially endorsed the document.The delegations had barely arrived in Biarritz before differences were exposed, with senior US officials accusing the host, French president Emmanuel Macron, of looking “to fracture the G7” by focusing on “niche issues” rather than major global concerns.France denied this, pointing to Sunday’s initial session covering the economy, trade and security - areas that used to draw easy consensus but are now sources of great friction.Overnight, Mr Trump wrote on Twitter that lunch with Mr Macron was the best meeting the pair had yet had, and that a meeting with world leaders on Saturday evening also “went very well.”France has got around the communique problem by doing away with the time-honoured document, deciding it was not worth even trying to find common language.While the transatlantic rift is the most stark, there are also deep isions within the European camp, with Mr Johnson making his G7 debut at a time when he is struggling to persuade EU capitals to renegotiate Britain’s exit from the bloc.Mr Johnson and Mr Tusk, who are due to talk on Sunday, sparred ahead of the meeting over who would take the blame if Britain leaves the EU on October 31st without a Brexit agreement acceptable to both sides.“I still hope that PM Johnson will not like to go down in history as Mr No Deal,” said Mr Tusk, who leads the political direction of the 28-nation EU.Mr Johnson later retorted that it would be Mr Tusk himself who would carry that mantle if Britain could not secure a new withdrawal agreement.Mr Macron added to the internal EU strains by unexpectedly threatening on Friday to block an EU trade deal with a group of South American states over Brazil’s handling of fires that are ravaging the Amazon rainforest.Germany and Britain both voiced deep concern about the fires, but disagreed with Macron on how to respond, saying shooting down the ambitious Mercosur trade accord would not help save the Amazon.–Reuters "},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons august 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Order The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Comment: We will never save the rainforest until a living tree is worth more to Brazil than an incinerated oneComment: The Europeans always knew we Brits were too swashbuckling for Brussels  Comment: Boris should scrap our archaic Sunday trading laws, and let people choose when to shopDonald Trump wants to strike deal \u0026#39within a year\u0026#39, says Boris Johnson, as US president describes EU as \u0026#39anchor\u0026#39 around Britain\u0026#39s anklesSerious injuries in private care rise sevenfoldDame Esther Rantzen says Skype won\u0026#39t combat loneliness of elderly like a hug and cuppaCriminal gangs strike at almost half of churches in rural BritainComment: Michael Gove is vindicated: state schools are finally catching up with private schools Powerful, obscure law is basis for Trump \u0026#39order\u0026#39 on tradeMan in 60s stabbed to death in broad daylight outside west London pubBan on liquids over 100ml to be lifted as airports introduce new scanning technologyBoris Johnson tells Donald Trump: it\u0026#39s time to help British firms\u0026#39AI is not being developed fast enough to stop child abuse\u0026#39Comment: While welcome, the Government\u0026#39s HS2 review has to be transparent British companies want the UK to \u0026#39end the current uncertainty\u0026#39 and \u0026#39crack on\u0026#39 with leaving the EU, Andrea Leadsom saysCarrie Symonds\u0026#39 young eco warriors seek help to buy rainforestComment: We will do everything in our power to help businesses seize the vast opportunities of BrexitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bring back child labour good know","story":"You never know: it might revive struggling industries like the chimney sweepDevastating news.

It also suggests that search could be more likely to find life on exoplanets than we had thought.This is a surprising conclusion, said lead researcher Dr Stephanie Olson.\u0026nbspIt shows us that conditions on some exoplanets with favourable ocean circulation patterns could be better suited to support life that is more abundant or more active than life on Earth.In recent years, scientists have found huge numbers of exoplanets, or worlds orbiting around stars that are not our own. But they are all very far away – impossible to reach even with the fastest space probes, and difficult even to see in any detail.Researchers are working on a variety of ways to learn about those worlds, including telescopes that will be able to sniff their atmospheres and learn more about what the planets could be made of. But to understand the information that comes back, scientists need to build detailed and complicated models of how planets form and their climates work.Created with Sketch.Best NASA pictures of the month - July 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A total solar eclipse as seen from the US National Science Federation observatory in the Chilean Andes on 2 JulyA composite image of the Cygnus OB2 star cluster composed of pictures taken by the Isaac Newton Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope on July 24The spacecraft Soyuz MS-13 is launched at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on July 20A copy of LIFE magazine from July 4 1969 signed by Michael Collins is seen onboard the Soyuz spacecraftThe galaxy NGC 1156 which is said to resemble a cherry blossom tree.

Using that Nasa technology, they were able to create models of the possible climates and oceans that could be on those exoplanets.They found that many of them seemed like more hospitable and flourishing places for life than even Earth is. They looked at the process in Earth\u0027s oceans that allows life to take root down here – and considered whether that same process could be happening elsewhere in the universe.Our work has been aimed at identifying the exoplanet oceans which have the greatest capacity to host globally abundant and active life, said Dr Olson in a statement.Life in Earth\u0027s oceans depends on upwelling (upward flow) which returns nutrients from the dark depths of the ocean to the sunlit portions of the ocean where photosynthetic life lives. More upwelling means more nutrient resupply, which means more biological activity.These are the conditions we need to look for on exoplanets.By modelling a variety of different exoplanets, the researchers were able to think about which types would be most likely to develop and then sustain life. And they were surprised to find that Earth is not the best kind – and that there may be other worlds out there that are a far better place for life to begin.We have used an ocean circulation model to identify which planets will have the most efficient upwelling and thus offer particularly hospitable oceans, she said.\u0026nbspWe found that higher atmospheric density, slower rotation rates, and the presence of continents all yield higher upwelling rates.A further implication is that Earth might not be optimally habitable – and life elsewhere may enjoy a planet that is even more hospitable than our own.The work is important because our technology means that we are unable to see everything: there is almost certainly more life than we will ever be able to see, even with the most advanced telescopes and other equipment. That means scientists will need to optimise their search by looking at the planets where life will find it easiest to find a home.We expect oceans to be important in regulating some of the most compelling remotely detectable signs of life on habitable worlds, but our understanding of oceans beyond our solar system is currently very rudimentary, said\u0026nbspChris\u0026nbspReinhard, from the Georgia Institute of Technology, who wasn\u0027t involved in the study.\u0026nbspDr\u0026nbspOlson\u0027s work represents a significant and exciting step forward in our understanding of exoplanet oceanography.The new research could now help inform how new telescopes are built, since we now know what kinds of planets will be best to search for. Now we know what to look for, so we need to start looking, said Dr Olson.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That has to be the cruellest thing in the world.“Babs always recognises me when she sees me but then I don’t know what it would be like the following day. Every time I have seen her, she has given me a big hug and she has these sparkling eyes and she is ‘Allo, sweetheart’. She is lovely.”Richie, who has appeared on EastEnders on and off since 2002, said he hopes his former co-star can attend his new stage show.Created with Sketch.Dame Barbara Windsor: career in pictures Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Barbara Windsor was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to charity and entertainment.Practicing her high kicks at Aida Foster School for the role of Red Riding HoodAppearing in the West End Musical \u0027Fings aint what they used to be\u0027During filming of \u0027Crooks in the Cloisters\u0027Windsor sporting her now infamous blonde barnet Windsor playing a hitchhiker in British comedy \u0027San Ferry Ann\u0027Starring in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang With first husband Ronnie Knight Appearing alongside Sid James in Carry On film \u0027Carry On Henry\u0027Barbara Windsor at the Bafta Television AwardsBarbara Windsor as her most famous character, Eastenders\u0027 Peggy MitchellWith Steve McFadden who plays her on-screen son Phil Mitchell in EastEnders at the National Television AwardsWith some of the EastEnders cast at the National Television Awards.

When someone of his standing makes a statement like that, it should give pause for thought.But according to Daniel Pitchford, co-founder of AI Business, this view, while pretty common, is over-egging the situation slightly.Pitchford set up AI Business, an “online content portal for artificial intelligence and its real-world applications” back in 2014 with the intention of demystifying AI for businesses and trying to cut through some of the more hyperbolic beliefs about AI.There is no doubting Musk is not alone in his apocalyptic view of AI so Pitchford clearly has his work cut out in converting the business masses but what, in his view, is behind this rather extreme reaction?\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

What is the ROI and outcome before you start. Is that realistic?\u0026nbsp“A lot of people think AI is going to change the world and if they plug a piece of software or application on top of what they are already doing\u0026nbsptheir business is going to transform overnight, and then end up bitterly disappointed when it isn’t,” he says.The fear stems from change. Whether it is AI or whether it is the industrial revolution – whatever the change is – that is what people fear because humans don’t really like to changeWhich is where he hopes his business can play a crucial role. Starting out as a blog written in his and his business partner’s spare time, AI Business quickly grew to become a trusted source of AI insight for business across the world by producing business-useful content, in contrast to the academic content that dominated at the time.But with his background in business event production, Pitchford was aware that for AI Business to become truly indispensable to the business community, it had to adopt a thoroughly analogue approach and bring vendors and businesses together face to face.From 400 attendees at its\u0026nbspinaugural AI Summit in London in 2016, AI Business is now the leading brand globally hosting events in London, New York, San Francisco, Munich, Hong Kong, Singapore and Cape Town. The 2019 Summit in London alone drew 25,000 AI enthusiasts.So clearly there is an appetite to understand the applications and implications of AI in the business world,\u0026nbspbut what is the destination?\u0026nbsp“Ultimately, the future of AI is about increasing productivity and that’s what politicians and governments get excited about – what can it do for our GDP? That is the big end goal,” Pitchford explains.Elon Musk’s AI project to replicate the human brain just received $1bnA 2017 report from PWC estimated that UK GDP could increase by more than 10 per cent\u0026nbspby 2030 as a result of AI, a cash equivalent of £232bn, which is no small shakes.But the UK is not the only nation eyeing the benefits of AI, with Pitchford outlining a global AI arms race between China and the US, each vying for the position of the world’s AI superpower.“A lot of people are saying China will emerge as the AI superpower. Over the last two years, Asia has overtaken Europe in terms of the amount being invested by enterprises and businesses in the adoption of AI whereas two years ago, Europe was ahead.”He says that China’s rapid emergence can be explained by the level of investment the Chinese government is putting into AI with latest estimates placing it as high as $300bn\u0026nbsp(£240bn): “As you move from innovation to implementation there is a massive opportunity which they are acutely aware of, hence the investment they are pouring in.”Such is the rate of change in AI development and implementation, it would be foolish to bet on any one nation or region becoming the dominant power just yet. But in the meantime, AI Business\u0026nbspintends to build on its own dominance in this space following its recent acquisition by publishing giant Informa.“The future is scale,” Pitchford says. “What we have with Informa is that opportunity of scale. The scale of the events and other acquisitions made by the group help that in terms of collaboration and opportunities.”And as for the allegedly demonic heart of AI? Pitchford says that proponents are acutely aware of the potential dangers and are actively addressing it.“There is a lot being invested by the big players in understanding how AI can support society rather than just generate profit,” he says.\u0026nbspSo perhaps the robot apocalypse might yet be averted by traditional human compassion.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

That is the lowest reading in three months and the joint-lowest since February 2016.The index is based on surveys of service and manufacturing firms, with each sector given its own index. The reading for services was 50.9, also the lowest in three months. For factories, the index stood at 49.9, indicating the first contraction since September 2009.“August’s survey data provides a clear signal that economic growth has continued to soften in the third quarter,” said Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit which compiles the data.“The PMIs for manufacturing and services remain much weaker than at the beginning of 2019 and collectively point to annualised GDP growth of around 1.5 per cent.”The poor manufacturing measure was mainly a result of a fall in new orders, while output continued growing, IHS Markit said. The data also showed the fastest drop in factories’ export sales in 10 years, with firms often citing the weakening in the global economy. \u0026nbspThe surveys are likely to fuel fears that the trade war with China instigated by Donald Trump is starting to hurt US factories.Mr Moore added: “Business expectations for the year ahead became more gloomy in August and remain the lowest since comparable data were first available in 2012.”\u0026nbspMost US business economists expect a recession in the US by the end of 2021, according to a survey by the National Association for Business Economics released on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”.

Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. The first of a number of future Star Wars TV series on Disney+,\u0026nbspThe Mandalorian stars Pedro Pascal as a lone bounty hunter roaming the wasteland left behind after the downfall of the Empire at the end of Return of the Jedi.Pascal is surrounded by an eclectic cast that includes Carl Weathers, Giancarlo Esposito, Gina Carano, Nick Nolte and the literal Werner Herzog, who is reliably snarling and menacing in the trailer.Following years of speculation, Ewan McGregor is indeed returning to the Star Wars universe and reprising his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi. According to Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, the scripts for the series have already been written, with production due to begin in 2020.It was previously reported that the character, played by Alec Guinness in the original trilogy, would be getting his own film, but following the disappointing box office performance of the Han Solo spin-off movie Solo: A Star Wars Story, the studio has decided to proceed with the project on the small screen.Ms Marvel, She-Hulk and Moon KnightWhile we know little about any of these projects\u0026nbspother than the fact that they’re in development, TV series based on comic book characters Ms Marvel, She-Hulk and Moon Knight are in the pipeline. In her current incarnation, Ms Marvel is the first Muslim superhero to headline her own Marvel comic book. Moon Knight is a former US marine who transforms into a costumed vigilante at night, while She-Hulk is historically the cousin of male-Hulk Dr Bruce Banner.According to the Hollywood Reporter, British writer and comedian Bisha K Ali will write the Ms Marvel series.After appearing on stage to perform a rendition of “We’re All In This Together” from the original High School Musical, the cast of the TV series adaptation introduced the show’s first trailer. The new High School Musical is in truth a mockumentary (which explains the convoluted title) that follows a group of high school students auditioning for their school play… which is High School Musical itself.Lady and the TrampThe first trailer for Disney’s live-action remake of the animated classic was also released. The new film finds Tessa Thompson and Justin Theroux voicing the dogs of the title, with real-life rescue dogs supplying their form (though with some CGI assistance to make their mouths move). Kiersey Clemons and Thomas Mann are Lady’s live-action owners, while Janelle Monae, Sam Elliott and Ken Jeong are among the supporting voiceover cast.Disney+ launches on 12 November in the US, Canada,\u0026nbspAustralia and the Netherlands, but a UK launch date remains unannounced so far.Lady and the Tramp\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ricci’s deadpan performance is so gloriously apathetic and mean that she comfortably steals the show from her adult co-stars, and deservedly had her role beefed up for the film’s sequel. (AW)218 Saoirse Ronan in Atonement (2007)Since Atonement, Ronan has become one of the most accomplished actors of her generation. And it’s no surprise, given how convincingly she brought to life, at the age of 13, Ian McEwan’s precocious and stubborn protagonist Briony Tallis, whose misinterpretation of a romantic encounter between her sister and her childhood friend wreaks havoc in the lives of those around her. (EH)318 Quvenzhané Wallis in Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012)Quvenzhané Wallis is proof that lying sometimes gets you places. As a five-year-old, the child star convinced her parents to let her fib about her age so that she could audition for Beasts of the Southern Wild – their minimum age was six. So impressed was director Benh Zeitlin by Wallis that he changed his entire script so that the character of Hushpuppy matched her stubborn personality. At the age of nine, she became the youngest Best Actress nominee in Oscars history. (JS)418 Aleksei Kravchenko in Come and See (1985)Horrific war film Come and See – which depicts Nazism through a child’s eyes – is a nightmarish but essential experience, if only to witness the performance of Aleksei Kravchenko. It would have been tough for an actor of any age to film the scenes asked of him by director Elem Klimov let alone a 14-year old one, but Kravchenko commits so nobly it’s hard to tear your eyes from the screen. He found the shoot so troubling that he reportedly developed grey hair. (JS)518 Jean-Pierre Léaud in The 400 Blows (1959)Jean-Pierre Léaud was one of several hundred boys who François Truffaut auditioned for The 400 Blows and it’s easy to see why he won the role. In Truffaut, Léaud found a mentor –  he took control of the 15-year-old\u0027s upbringing when shooting ended after he was expelled from school and kicked out of his carers’ home – and Léaud would return as the character five more times. (JS)618 Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone (1990)Considering he starts Home Alone as an obnoxious “little jerk”, it’s a testament to Macaulay Culkin’s skill that Kevin McCallister manages to worm his way into viewers’ hearts . Culkin has insane amounts of fun ruling the roost when his family accidentally forget to bring him on their Christmas holiday, and it never fails to be a gleeful experience watching Kevin runs rings around bumbling burglars Harry (Daniel Stern) and Marv (Joe Pesci). (JS)718 Abigail Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine (2006)Breslin became one of the youngest Oscar nominees of all time when she received a nod for Best Supporting Actress for her performance, aged 10, as Olive Hoover in the beloved 2006 road movie. She played an underdog youngster on a mission to win a beauty contest, accompanied by her quirky and dysfunctional family, with real wit and flair. (EH)818 Alex Hibbert in Moonlight (2016)Giving a performance in perfect symmetry to the film around him, Alex Hibbert is one of a number of brilliantly subtle actors in Moonlight. Only on screen for the film’s first third, he mostly inhabits a quiet and devastating yearning, embodying a character buried under the emotional weight of playground bullying and constant domestic upheaval, and desperate for someone to show him compassion and answer his questions. If Hollywood has any sense, Moonlight will be just the first of many incredible opportunities for the young star. (AW)918 Mara Wilson in Mrs Doubtfire (1993)Mara Wilson is one of those great child star success stories, immortalised in at least three classic movies while still in single-digits, retiring early, and now writing, podcasting and saying smart, funny things on Twitter. But while 1996’s Matilda is often talked about as her best work, she was somehow even more brilliant in Mrs Doubtfire three years earlier, where she is adorable and grouchy and seems to possess a beautifully sincere, if today bittersweet, joy over merely being in Robin Williams’s company. (AW)1018 Isabelle Fuhrman in Orphan (2009)Isabelle Fuhrman is scarily convincing in her role as Esther, the sickly-sweet orphan girl turned murderous dwarf asylum escapee. The sexual and violent nature of some scenes may be uncomfortable to watch, but there is no denying Fuhrman executes them perfectly. (MH)1118 Tatum O’Neal in Paper Moon (1973)Tatum O’Neal was, and still is, the youngest person to ever win an Oscar for her role as the sassy, smoking, swindling tomboy Addie in Paper Moon. Addie may or may not be the daughter of con man Moses, who is reluctantly saddled with the youngster before realising she can help him with his scams. Moses is played by O’Neal’s real-life father Ryan O’Neal, and there’s just no faking that kind of chemistry. (AP)1218 Lindsay Lohan in The Parent Trap (1998)Lohan was just 12 when she played identical twins Annie and Hallie in the 1998 classic. While the sisters were of course impossible to distinguish by their looks, their personalities and backgrounds could hardly have been more different: one was a well-to-do Londoner, the other a boisterous American tomboy. The young star impressed audiences with her ability to switch effortlessly and convincingly between the two. (EH)1318 Heather O’Rourke in Poltergeist (1982)Heather O’Rourke tragically died aged just 12 in 1988, but she will long be remembered as the ethereal blonde Carol Anne Freeling. Cast after a chance meeting with Steven Spielberg, she captivates the audience as a little girl who can communicate with “the other side” through the family television set. (MH)1418 Jacob Tremblay in Room (2015)Egregiously overlooked for an Oscar in 2016, Jacob Tremblay\u0027s performance in Room will pull out heartstrings you never knew you had. As Jack, a long-haired five-year-old who has been imprisoned in a garden shed all his life and is oblivious to the outside world, he not only raises the film\u0027s cute quotient, but also brings surprising depth. His is a turn of great maturity, one that scratches away at the fact that Jack has never had any male interaction. Brie Larson, who plays his mum, did win an Oscar for her role here. (PS)1518 Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense (1999)Haley Joel Osment’s performance as Cole Sear, a young boy tormented by his ability to see and talk to the dead, is so strong that he remains the most memorable part of the M Night Shyamalan film, despite a career-best turn from Bruce Willis and one of the most effective twists in cinema history. (JS)1618 River Phoenix in Stand by Me (1986)One of the few comforts to cling onto when thinking of River Phoenix’s tragic death aged 23 is that he was at least able to showcase his vast acting range before he died. The actor, whose brother is Joaquin Phoenix, played everything from tortured teenagers to tough adventurers and street hustlers. But perhaps his finest work came early, in 1986’s Stand by Me, when he played a sensitive pre-teen who masks insecurity and self-loathing beneath a veneer of macho posturing. It’s a staggering bit of acting from someone so young. (AW)1718 Hailee Steinfeld in True Grit (2010)It’s probably not true to say that Hailee Steinfeld is the only person who could have pulled off the role of the fearless Mattie Ross in the Coen brothers’ adaptation of Charles Portis novel True Grit – but from the moment she arrives in Fort Smith with plans to hunt down her father’s killer, she makes you feel like she is. How she didn\u0027t win Best Supporting Actress at the 2011 Oscars will remain a mystery. (JS)1818 Heather Matarazzo in Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995)Generally speaking, children acting in Todd Solondz movies need to have nerves of steel and far more self-confidence than average youngsters. But it takes a child of unusual gutsiness to enact the horrors inflicted upon poor Dawn Wiener in his 1995 film Welcome to the Dollhouse. A yearning, eager loner played to perfection by Heather Matarazzo, Dawn is the recipient of a level of casual cruelty that would feel fetishistic if it weren\u0027t so tragically true to life. When she was killed off before the credits in Solondz’s 2004 film Palindromes, the collective mourning it inspired in his fanbase was only a result of how powerfully Matarazzo’s performance lingered. (AW)118 Christina Ricci in The Addams Family (1991)In the 27 years since she was transferred to the big screen via Christina Ricci, Wednesday Addams has become less a character and more a mood, a religion and a lifestyle. Ricci’s deadpan performance is so gloriously apathetic and mean that she comfortably steals the show from her adult co-stars, and deservedly had her role beefed up for the film’s sequel.

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pretty Woman certainly isn’t good, with an undercurrent of sleaze so disquieting that it’s no real surprise to learn it was once planned to be a gritty sex work drama that ended in tragedy. But Julia Roberts is pure star-is-born loveliness here, beloved by the camera and endlessly watchable as a result, her joyous pluck overshadowing the rest of the film’s murkier elements. That Disney, the studio behind the film, imagined its aspirational romcom hero as a rich businessman prowling Hollywood Boulevard for an escort is slightly maddening. That Pretty Woman somehow pulls it off… even more so.There are a few moments in this high-school re-telling of George Bernard Shaw\u0027s Pygmalion – in which, due to an elaborate bet, popular jock Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr) attempts to turn artsy nerd Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the Prom Queen in six weeks – that pull the rug out from under your feet. One such moment is when Laney finds out about Zach’s ploy. “Am I a bet? Am I a bet? Am I a f**king bet?” It is raw, painful, and elevates the film well above your average high-school romcom.Saving Face is both a romantic comedy about gay women, and a romantic comedy about two Asian-Americans, making it a double rarity in the genre. But its loveliest quality is its Manhattan earthiness, with its smoky streets, subway cars, fire escapes and cheap take-out places, all backdrops to the tentative relationship between surgeon Michelle Krusiec and dancer Lynn Chen.Partly because she was its last high-profile “queen”, Katherine Heigl has often been positioned as the actor that killed the romantic comedy. Which is unfair for a host of reasons, but specifically because both Knocked Up and 27 Dresses are such pristine examples of how great the romcom can still be. 27 Dresses is the more traditional of the pair, Heigl surrounded by stock characters (including Judy Greer once again cast as the sad-sack best friend, as she did in the Jennifer Lopez vehicle The Wedding Planner) and playing a brunette and therefore unlucky-in-love single New Yorker obsessed with weddings. But she is such a delightfully prickly and neurotic presence that it makes up for the film’s lesser qualities. We truly didn’t appreciate her at the time.530 26. Playing by Heart (1998)Not strictly a romantic comedy, buoyed as it is by serious drama involving everything from infidelity to AIDS, Playing by Heart is one of those talky, interconnected, Robert Altman-esque indies that dominated so much of American cinema in the Nineties. But the reason it’s here is because two of its many storylines feature lighter pairings that appear unlikely on paper but somehow become incredibly compelling and tender in execution. In one, Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe meet at an LA bar and begin a romance in another, Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart meet in a bookstore and begin dating. Both stories develop from there, with Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Ellen Burstyn and Madeleine Stowe among the recognisable faces orbiting them. But whatever the tone of each seemingly unrelated story, Playing by Heart is driven by a lovely, nostalgic sense of Los Angeles ennui at the end of the 20th century. No one has heard of this movie, and that’s a shame.Crazy Rich Asians may not have saved the romantic comedy last summer, as everyone predicted it would, but it remains a breathless celebration of the genre – with a far-too-late-in-the-day but still wholly appreciated ersity at its centre. Constance Wu is the New York economics professor who discovers her apparently Average Joe fiancee is in fact Singapore royalty. What follows is a fish-out-of-water comedy that both indulges in its gorgeous opulence while never becoming too in awe of it. Michelle Yeoh is a standout, as a high society matriarch intimidatingly protective of her son.Few romantic comedies are more nakedly aspirational about big-city jobs, capitalism and the social power of being busy than One Fine Day, a mid-Nineties comedy about two single parents thrust together when their hectic schedules mean their children miss the class trip. There are far too many big cellphones here, but Michelle Pfeiffer and an ER-era George Clooney, as the squabbling pair at its centre, must surely rank as one of the most beautiful romantic comedy couples in recent memory.The first black, mainstream romantic comedy to possess the same aspirational sheen as their white counterparts, Boomerang is a lively battle-of-the-sexes comedy with Eddie Murphy as a powerful, womanising advertising executive spurned by his female doppelganger (Robin Givens). Grace Jones, Eartha Kitt and a young Halle Berry make for wonderful supporting players, but Boomerang’s secret weapon is Givens, who gives a performance with so much sparkiness that it’s enraging her volatile marriage to Mike Tyson overshadowed much of her acting career.Released a decade after Knocked Up, Seth Rogen’s adorable if occasionally bro-heavy first stab at the romcom, Long Shot bears the fruits of a man who has fixed some of his more regressive tendencies in the interim, producing something smarter, more sensitive and as interested in the feelings, neuroses and dialogue of his female co-star as he is to himself. He is a left-wing journalist recruited as a speechwriter for his former babysitter (Charlize Theron), who is now the US Secretary of State, and the pair forge an unshakable bond despite their wildly juxtaposed looks and vocations in life. Against the odds, Theron and Rogen are adorable together, while the film strikes a wonderful balance between sweetness and crudity. Long Shot may have flopped at the box office, but it’s the closest thing we’ve had to a romcom classic in years.A perfect encapsulation of the Fifties, specifically the allure of the European jet-set, the idealised rat-a-tat-tat magic of big-city journalists, and the otherworldly regality of Audrey Hepburn, Roman Holiday is more of a time machine than most of the films here. But it’s also a true-blue classic, its “famous woman paired with ordinary man” plot inspiring everything from Notting Hill to The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and appropriately beloved as a result. There’s no Hilary Duff, obviously, but we won’t hold that against it.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a bit like peering into a time capsule a reminder of a time when Russell Brand was (nearly) a Hollywood A-lister, and people believed Jason Segel could be a movie star. Of the post-Judd Apatow era of romantic comedies, this remains the best, however – nicely balancing genuine sweetness and pathos (Mila Kunis is at the peak of her adorability as Segel’s love interest) with A-grade smut (Segel’s two full-frontal nude scenes remain hilariously shocking no matter how often you’ve seen them). There’s also a puppet musical thrown in for good measure, which is never not welcome.Very loudly not fun but still something quietly extraordinary, The Break-Up is a romcom in reverse, with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn a couple at the end of their tether, who really shouldn’t be together and break up before the opening credits roll, and then muddle through the following 90 minutes figuring out what to do next. Aniston, always underrated as a movie star, is brilliantly magnetic, while Vaughn nicely downplays the manic energy that tends to suffocate his on-screen partners in his other roles. The film’s closer, a thoughtful, heartfelt celebration of having once loved someone regardless of how it all ended, is one of the bravest things an expensive studio romcom has done in recent decades.This satirical comedy set at a gay conversion camp has, quite clearly, a lot more than romance on its mind. But Jamie Babbit’s pink satin-coloured debut is most memorable for the brewing relationship between Clea DuVall’s Graham and Natasha Lyonne’s Megan. One is more in denial about their sexuality than the other, but they discover a mutual attraction while being held under the thumb of Cathy Moriarty’s conversion camp den mother – who, it should be said, is somehow more of a drag queen than her colleague (played by a de-glammed RuPaul).1430 17. Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994)An underwritten female lead in the form of Andie MacDowell’s Carrie is the only fly in this wry, warm-hearted ointment. Revolving around a group of friends as they attend – you guessed it – four weddings and a funeral, this film marks the first of many collaborations between Hugh Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis. We can probably all agree that the hopeless, stuttering Charlie should have ended up with his best friend Fiona (Kristin Scott-Thomas), but without his devastating indifference towards her, we would never have been blessed with one of the most magnanimous displays of unrequited love ever committed to film. The film’s worth your time, too, for its quietly progressive, heart-wrenching gay subplot.As much a ludicrously beautiful romcom as it is a nostalgic snapshot of the New York hip-hop scene at the turn of the 21st century, Brown Sugar casts Taye Diggs as an A\u0026ampR executive for a record label and Sanaa Lathan, magnetised to so many black romcoms during this time, as the editor for XXL Magazine. Friends since childhood, they’re perfect for one another, but involved with other people (the similarly too-beautiful-for-words real-life couple Boris Kodjoe and Nicole Ari Parker). Queen Latifah and Mos Def are their perfectly cast best friends, just to add to the film’s early-Noughties charm.Most great romcoms are lucky enough to have one stand-out set piece that becomes embedded in the cultural landscape. Love Actually, the annually inescapable Christmas romcom behemoth from Richard Curtis, has about six or seven. Because it’s as famous as it is, Love Actually oddly has a tendency to be underrated, dismissed as too cutesy or misogynist, too awkwardly Blairite in its politics. And all of that, in fairness, is true. But it’s also a real classic of the form – masterfully structured, endlessly watchable, and filled with familiar faces, sweet romances and heartache. It’s love in all its colours, often cringeworthy, sometimes monstrous, but always compelling to watch unfold.The secret masterpiece of the teen movie boom birthed in 1999, and truthfully one of the last of that era, Get Over It grabs so many elements from its subgenre predecessors (a Shakespearean undercurrent, sexually excitable animals and cameos from one-hit-wonders of the time) that it’s a wonder it’s so brilliant. Ben Foster is the recently-dumped high school basketball player who signs up for the school play (a musical version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, naturally) to woo back his ex, only to fall for the adorable younger sister (Kirsten Dunst) of his best friend. Surrounding them are an array of recognisable faces, including Mila Kunis, Martin Short, Zoe Saldana and the literal Sisqo, while it features one of the finest Backstreet Boys-era boyband spoofs this side of Josie and the Pussycats.1830 13. 500 Days of Summer (2009)Beloved and loathed in equal measure, 500 Days of Summer is notorious among a certain generation of young people who grew up with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel as quirky hipster pin-ups. And it’s likewise already something of a nostalgic masterpiece, beloved in first-year university film studies classes if then loudly rejected come graduation. There’s a lot to say about where its allegiances lie (is Deschanel’s Summer the movie’s villain, or its rational, realistic hero?), but that discussion also swallows up appreciation for what is for the most part a clever and funny comedy, and a movie that sincerely celebrates the conventions of the genre.It is funny in hindsight that there was such a stink over the casting of the Texan Renee Zellweger as the very English Bridget Jones. Because could you now imagine anyone else playing her? Her accent flawless (in that very prim, written-by-Richard-Curtis way), Zellweger similarly nails the spirited, neurotic melancholy that makes Bridget such a likable character, despite all the reasons we probably wouldn’t be able to stand her in reality. Like most of Curtis’s work, there is a lovely comfort to Bridget Jones, full as it is of slapstick, silly jumpers and new-Millennium London, featuring Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as “adorable dork” and “magnificent bastard”, respectively, and a perfect Christmas finale. It’s truly one of the best of the genre.2030 11. 13 Going on 30 (2004)If every romantic comedy is a fantasy, then 13 Going on 30 is the ultimate fantasy romcom. As if she has watched too many herself, unhappy tween Jenna Rink wishes she could be 30, flirty and thriving, and wakes up one morning a high-powered magazine editor who looks like Jennifer Garner, and whose dorky neighbour has transformed into Mark Ruffalo. By turns incredibly touching and genuinely funny, 13 Going on 30 is brought to life by Garner, who plays the adult-bodied Jenna as a guileless spark plug of self-doubt, glee and determination. Also features none of the weird child molesting undertones of Big, which we should forever be thankful for.With Nora Ephron having slipped off this mortal coil, Nancy Meyers has more or less claimed her spot as Hollywood’s most dependable creator of sensitive and funny love stories set within designer kitchens. She has a largely great filmography, but Something’s Gotta Give remains her masterpiece. Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, both twinkling with lived-in Seventies-movie-star ease, play variations on their off-screen personas: her the exasperated neurotic, him the womanising letch. They’re thrown together in the Hamptons, stumble upon an unexpected attraction, and wrestle with what it all means. Keanu Reeves, as Keaton’s doctor and secondary love interest, is additionally a dream.There’s a great Arrested Development storyline in which Jason Bateman’s character doesn’t realise his love interest is mentally ill because she’s an eccentric British woman who looks like Charlize Theron. It may or may not have been inspired by Serendipity, the greatest romantic comedy ever made about a deranged and beautiful Englishwoman fixated on fate, chance and the cosmos. Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack meet by chance at Christmastime in New York, share a blissful evening together but then go their separate ways, Beckinsale sure that they must only date if the universe doesn’t otherwise intervene. Some time later, the pair are engaged to other people, but can’t shake their memories of that fateful Christmas Eve. Sweet, cosy and completely irresistible, Serendipity is a rare Christmas movieromantic comedy twofer and features two lovely performances at its centre. Absolutely bonkers, to be fair, but few films on this list aren’t.2330 8. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)Gut-wrenching to watch in the wake of Heath Ledger’s death, but still one of the smartest, most convincingly heartwarming comedies of the last 20 years. Ledger and Julia Stiles are a pair of “unappealing” high schoolers whose romance is engineered by Stiles’s younger sister, who can only date once she does. There is much to love here, from the film’s feminist politics (10 Things remains the holy grail of its era, in that regard) to its delightful supporting cast. But it’s Ledger and Stiles that burn the screen. Their chemistry is so authentic, charming and sexy that it’s almost uncomfortable to watch, with only the fact that they’re both ridiculously beautiful encouraging you never to turn away.Christmas has never been better presented in all its melancholy splendor than in Billy Wilder’s The Apartment, with two lonely souls both left dispirited by the holiday season yet finding each other hopelessly up in one another’s lives. Jack Lemmon is unsurprisingly wonderful as one half of the film’s central twosome, who loans out his apartment to his lecherous bosses so they can conduct their affairs, but it is Shirley Maclaine who provides the film with its heart – she is bruised and brittle but eager for connection, and perfectly embodies the dizzying emotions of the winter season.Considering how many people adore My Best Friend’s Wedding, it’s always surprising to re-discover how monstrous its apparent heroine is. Julia Roberts has had better-received roles before and since, but there’s something fascinatingly daring about her work here, playing a single woman in love with her best friend and determined to destroy his wedding to a lovely if naive rich girl she has decided is evil. Cameron Diaz, as the bride-to-be, is an adorable revelation, Rupert Everett a hoot as Roberts’s then-radical “gay best friend”. And the sheer darkness on display here, mixed with that funny and expensive Nineties-romcom sheen, makes it one of the most intriguing romcoms in history, and secretly one of its very best.You could argue that June and Joseph – the dead, park bench couple – have the most poignant love story in this film, but the one between world-famous movie star Anna (Julia Roberts) and very-much-not-famous bookshop owner Will (Hugh Grant at perhaps his most charming, foppish and floppy-haired) comes a close second.A fizzy treasure of a comedy that set the tone for much of what came after it, The Philadelphia Story casts a never-haughtier Katharine Hepburn as a feisty heiress stuck between three men: her dull fiancé (John Howard), a prickly journalist (James Stewart) and the ex (Cary Grant) still hopelessly in love with her. Everyone speaks incredibly fast, romantic tribulations occur in elegant mansion estates and the film’s central trio embody an impossible movie-star glamour you can’t help but begin to miss as soon as they appear on screen.We know. Where you stand on Woody Allen’s work, particularly the stuff not revolving around the apparent inability of young women to resist the allure of a scrawny, bespectacled middle-aged neurotic, is one of those endless pop culture questions we’ve all asked ourselves in recent years. If anything, though, watch Annie Hall for Diane Keaton at her most Diane Keatonish – daffy, stylish and impossibly cool, she becomes so much more than an idealised fantasy figure through sheer force of will. Annie Hall, admittedly, is a masterpiece, if you can look past the obvious.While Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan’s most famous prior romcom collaboration, 1993’s Sleepless in Seattle, has a dark melancholy that makes it less immediately pleasurable to watch, their 1998 reunion in You’ve Got Mail is the kind of movie built for comforting rewatches beneath a blanket. Or at least once every year at Christmas. The pair play sworn enemies waged in a war over the future of Ryan’s ludicrously serene independent book shop, but find love when interacting anonymously online. Despite the dial-up modems and archaic dialogue (“What’s email?” everyone seems on the verge of asking), You’ve Got Mail hasn’t aged poorly, proving how timeless chemistry-driven love stories between beautiful movie stars can be. And considering how brilliant Ryan is here, oscillating between tough strength and soft vulnerability, it is no surprise that she is still regarded as the star most associated with the genre.Truthfully, it couldn’t be anything else. Not only did When Harry Met Sally kickstart the romcom boom that dominated the Nineties, it also invented much of what we recognise today as clichés: from the sardonic best friend (played to perfection by Carrie Fisher), to the late-night phone calls while watching old movies, the ChristmasNew Year’s climax, the “neurotic Jewish man”“Shiksa goddess woman” pairing at its centre, and the hilarious honesty when it comes to sex, never bettered than in the film’s iconic diner-orgasm scene. Romantic comedies are only clichéd because When Harry Met Sally set such a glorious benchmark for why these films work in the modern era, assisted by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan at their most golden, and a gorgeously structured script that leaps through time, written by the queen of the genre herself, Nora Ephron. Nothing will ever better this.Pretty Woman certainly isn’t good, with an undercurrent of sleaze so disquieting that it’s no real surprise to learn it was once planned to be a gritty sex work drama that ended in tragedy. But Julia Roberts is pure star-is-born loveliness here, beloved by the camera and endlessly watchable as a result, her joyous pluck overshadowing the rest of the film’s murkier elements. That Disney, the studio behind the film, imagined its aspirational romcom hero as a rich businessman prowling Hollywood Boulevard for an escort is slightly maddening. That Pretty Woman somehow pulls it off… even more so.There are a few moments in this high-school re-telling of George Bernard Shaw\u0027s Pygmalion – in which, due to an elaborate bet, popular jock Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr) attempts to turn artsy nerd Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the Prom Queen in six weeks – that pull the rug out from under your feet. One such moment is when Laney finds out about Zach’s ploy. “Am I a bet? Am I a bet? Am I a f**king bet?” It is raw, painful, and elevates the film well above your average high-school romcom.Saving Face is both a romantic comedy about gay women, and a romantic comedy about two Asian-Americans, making it a double rarity in the genre. But its loveliest quality is its Manhattan earthiness, with its smoky streets, subway cars, fire escapes and cheap take-out places, all backdrops to the tentative relationship between surgeon Michelle Krusiec and dancer Lynn Chen.Partly because she was its last high-profile “queen”, Katherine Heigl has often been positioned as the actor that killed the romantic comedy. Which is unfair for a host of reasons, but specifically because both Knocked Up and 27 Dresses are such pristine examples of how great the romcom can still be. 27 Dresses is the more traditional of the pair, Heigl surrounded by stock characters (including Judy Greer once again cast as the sad-sack best friend, as she did in the Jennifer Lopez vehicle The Wedding Planner) and playing a brunette and therefore unlucky-in-love single New Yorker obsessed with weddings. But she is such a delightfully prickly and neurotic presence that it makes up for the film’s lesser qualities. We truly didn’t appreciate her at the time.530 26. Playing by Heart (1998)Not strictly a romantic comedy, buoyed as it is by serious drama involving everything from infidelity to AIDS, Playing by Heart is one of those talky, interconnected, Robert Altman-esque indies that dominated so much of American cinema in the Nineties. But the reason it’s here is because two of its many storylines feature lighter pairings that appear unlikely on paper but somehow become incredibly compelling and tender in execution. In one, Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe meet at an LA bar and begin a romance in another, Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart meet in a bookstore and begin dating. Both stories develop from there, with Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Ellen Burstyn and Madeleine Stowe among the recognisable faces orbiting them. But whatever the tone of each seemingly unrelated story, Playing by Heart is driven by a lovely, nostalgic sense of Los Angeles ennui at the end of the 20th century. No one has heard of this movie, and that’s a shame.Crazy Rich Asians may not have saved the romantic comedy last summer, as everyone predicted it would, but it remains a breathless celebration of the genre – with a far-too-late-in-the-day but still wholly appreciated ersity at its centre. Constance Wu is the New York economics professor who discovers her apparently Average Joe fiancee is in fact Singapore royalty. What follows is a fish-out-of-water comedy that both indulges in its gorgeous opulence while never becoming too in awe of it. Michelle Yeoh is a standout, as a high society matriarch intimidatingly protective of her son.Few romantic comedies are more nakedly aspirational about big-city jobs, capitalism and the social power of being busy than One Fine Day, a mid-Nineties comedy about two single parents thrust together when their hectic schedules mean their children miss the class trip. There are far too many big cellphones here, but Michelle Pfeiffer and an ER-era George Clooney, as the squabbling pair at its centre, must surely rank as one of the most beautiful romantic comedy couples in recent memory.The first black, mainstream romantic comedy to possess the same aspirational sheen as their white counterparts, Boomerang is a lively battle-of-the-sexes comedy with Eddie Murphy as a powerful, womanising advertising executive spurned by his female doppelganger (Robin Givens). Grace Jones, Eartha Kitt and a young Halle Berry make for wonderful supporting players, but Boomerang’s secret weapon is Givens, who gives a performance with so much sparkiness that it’s enraging her volatile marriage to Mike Tyson overshadowed much of her acting career.Released a decade after Knocked Up, Seth Rogen’s adorable if occasionally bro-heavy first stab at the romcom, Long Shot bears the fruits of a man who has fixed some of his more regressive tendencies in the interim, producing something smarter, more sensitive and as interested in the feelings, neuroses and dialogue of his female co-star as he is to himself. He is a left-wing journalist recruited as a speechwriter for his former babysitter (Charlize Theron), who is now the US Secretary of State, and the pair forge an unshakable bond despite their wildly juxtaposed looks and vocations in life. Against the odds, Theron and Rogen are adorable together, while the film strikes a wonderful balance between sweetness and crudity. Long Shot may have flopped at the box office, but it’s the closest thing we’ve had to a romcom classic in years.A perfect encapsulation of the Fifties, specifically the allure of the European jet-set, the idealised rat-a-tat-tat magic of big-city journalists, and the otherworldly regality of Audrey Hepburn, Roman Holiday is more of a time machine than most of the films here. But it’s also a true-blue classic, its “famous woman paired with ordinary man” plot inspiring everything from Notting Hill to The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and appropriately beloved as a result. There’s no Hilary Duff, obviously, but we won’t hold that against it.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a bit like peering into a time capsule a reminder of a time when Russell Brand was (nearly) a Hollywood A-lister, and people believed Jason Segel could be a movie star. Of the post-Judd Apatow era of romantic comedies, this remains the best, however – nicely balancing genuine sweetness and pathos (Mila Kunis is at the peak of her adorability as Segel’s love interest) with A-grade smut (Segel’s two full-frontal nude scenes remain hilariously shocking no matter how often you’ve seen them). There’s also a puppet musical thrown in for good measure, which is never not welcome.Very loudly not fun but still something quietly extraordinary, The Break-Up is a romcom in reverse, with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn a couple at the end of their tether, who really shouldn’t be together and break up before the opening credits roll, and then muddle through the following 90 minutes figuring out what to do next. Aniston, always underrated as a movie star, is brilliantly magnetic, while Vaughn nicely downplays the manic energy that tends to suffocate his on-screen partners in his other roles. The film’s closer, a thoughtful, heartfelt celebration of having once loved someone regardless of how it all ended, is one of the bravest things an expensive studio romcom has done in recent decades.This satirical comedy set at a gay conversion camp has, quite clearly, a lot more than romance on its mind. But Jamie Babbit’s pink satin-coloured debut is most memorable for the brewing relationship between Clea DuVall’s Graham and Natasha Lyonne’s Megan. One is more in denial about their sexuality than the other, but they discover a mutual attraction while being held under the thumb of Cathy Moriarty’s conversion camp den mother – who, it should be said, is somehow more of a drag queen than her colleague (played by a de-glammed RuPaul).1430 17. Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994)An underwritten female lead in the form of Andie MacDowell’s Carrie is the only fly in this wry, warm-hearted ointment. Revolving around a group of friends as they attend – you guessed it – four weddings and a funeral, this film marks the first of many collaborations between Hugh Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis. We can probably all agree that the hopeless, stuttering Charlie should have ended up with his best friend Fiona (Kristin Scott-Thomas), but without his devastating indifference towards her, we would never have been blessed with one of the most magnanimous displays of unrequited love ever committed to film. The film’s worth your time, too, for its quietly progressive, heart-wrenching gay subplot.As much a ludicrously beautiful romcom as it is a nostalgic snapshot of the New York hip-hop scene at the turn of the 21st century, Brown Sugar casts Taye Diggs as an A\u0026ampR executive for a record label and Sanaa Lathan, magnetised to so many black romcoms during this time, as the editor for XXL Magazine. Friends since childhood, they’re perfect for one another, but involved with other people (the similarly too-beautiful-for-words real-life couple Boris Kodjoe and Nicole Ari Parker). Queen Latifah and Mos Def are their perfectly cast best friends, just to add to the film’s early-Noughties charm.Most great romcoms are lucky enough to have one stand-out set piece that becomes embedded in the cultural landscape. Love Actually, the annually inescapable Christmas romcom behemoth from Richard Curtis, has about six or seven. Because it’s as famous as it is, Love Actually oddly has a tendency to be underrated, dismissed as too cutesy or misogynist, too awkwardly Blairite in its politics. And all of that, in fairness, is true. But it’s also a real classic of the form – masterfully structured, endlessly watchable, and filled with familiar faces, sweet romances and heartache. It’s love in all its colours, often cringeworthy, sometimes monstrous, but always compelling to watch unfold.The secret masterpiece of the teen movie boom birthed in 1999, and truthfully one of the last of that era, Get Over It grabs so many elements from its subgenre predecessors (a Shakespearean undercurrent, sexually excitable animals and cameos from one-hit-wonders of the time) that it’s a wonder it’s so brilliant. Ben Foster is the recently-dumped high school basketball player who signs up for the school play (a musical version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, naturally) to woo back his ex, only to fall for the adorable younger sister (Kirsten Dunst) of his best friend. Surrounding them are an array of recognisable faces, including Mila Kunis, Martin Short, Zoe Saldana and the literal Sisqo, while it features one of the finest Backstreet Boys-era boyband spoofs this side of Josie and the Pussycats.1830 13. 500 Days of Summer (2009)Beloved and loathed in equal measure, 500 Days of Summer is notorious among a certain generation of young people who grew up with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel as quirky hipster pin-ups. And it’s likewise already something of a nostalgic masterpiece, beloved in first-year university film studies classes if then loudly rejected come graduation.

On Friday, the website still showed the remaining property – a five-bedroom house – as available for sale at a price of £875,000.One HAB investor, who put in several thousand pounds, was quoted as saying: “I’m disappointed that what I saw as an idealistic project seems to be collapsing on a sour note, with the original directors having departed and investors seemingly left to bear the entire financial burden of a failed enterprise.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I will of course do everything in my power to improve the current situation but I cannot discuss anything else at this point because we are, importantly, trying to find a resolution with both the mini-bond investors and the company.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But despite her long comic book history, a number of iniduals have taken to Disney’s official Instagram to complain about the series, which was announced yesterday, and what they have interpreted as merely a gender-switched version of The Hulk.Created with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

guarantees from Boris Johnson that he will not sign a post-Brexit trade deal with Brazil if it fuels the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.In a warning to the prime minister to be wary of a deal with far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, who has been accused of encouraging loggers and ranchers to clear the forest, shadow trade secretary Barry Gardiner said: “We cannot risk our planet to buy cheap beef.”Mr Johnson has refused to join French president Emmanuel Macron and Irish premier Leo Varadkar in threatening to block a South American trade deal if Mr Bolsonaro fails to live up to his commitments to protect the environment.Stressing his unwillingness to disrupt trade at a time when fears of a global showdown are rising, the PM said that some leaders at the G7 Summit in Biarritz were using the catastrophic wildfires in the Amazon as an “excuse” to interfere with free trade.But Mr Gardiner warned that a deal with Mr Bolsonaro might mean UK consumers eating beef from cows reared in the very areas currently being cleared of their ancient forest by fire.Created with Sketch.Amazon rainforest swept by fires: In pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with

Conor Burns, who posed for pictures drinking champagne with Brazilian minister Marcos Troyjo, who has explicitly backed Mr Bolsonaro’s policy of deforestation.Reports by environmental groups have shown links between beef imported from Brazil and sold in UK supermarkets and deforestation in the Amazon.EU president launches scathing attack on Trump as he arrives at G7The Amazon is a key carbon sink for the world’s carbon emissions and its destruction has a major impact on the global effort to tackle climate change. In addition the Amazon is home to an estimated 10 per cent of the world’s species.Mr Gardiner said: “While the Amazon rainforest burns to clear space for cattle and crops, the Conservative government is cosying up to Brazil’s far-right president Bolsonaro.“Any post-Brexit trade deal with Brazil must guarantee that the UK is not further contributing to the destruction of the Amazon.

That is the lowest reading in three months and the joint-lowest since February 2016.The index is based on surveys of service and manufacturing firms, with each sector given its own index. The reading for services was 50.9, also the lowest in three months. For factories, the index stood at 49.9, indicating the first contraction since September 2009.“August’s survey data provides a clear signal that economic growth has continued to soften in the third quarter,” said Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit which compiles the data.“The PMIs for manufacturing and services remain much weaker than at the beginning of 2019 and collectively point to annualised GDP growth of around 1.5 per cent.”The poor manufacturing measure was mainly a result of a fall in new orders, while output continued growing, IHS Markit said. The data also showed the fastest drop in factories’ export sales in 10 years, with firms often citing the weakening in the global economy. \u0026nbspThe surveys are likely to fuel fears that the trade war with China instigated by Donald Trump is starting to hurt US factories.Mr Moore added: “Business expectations for the year ahead became more gloomy in August and remain the lowest since comparable data were first available in 2012.”\u0026nbspMost US business economists expect a recession in the US by the end of 2021, according to a survey by the National Association for Business Economics released on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Clark Mindock reports from IowaClick to followThe Independent USWith the UK facing an uncertain future as Boris Johnson marches the country towards a no-deal Brexit, American farmers can’t help but see something of a golden opportunity to bring their goods into a new market.While many US farmers have historically been turned away from trading with the UK over fears for the implications of practices such as washing chickens in chlorine, or the use of genetically modified crops, Britain’s impending exit from the EU has left some dreaming of a change to that situation.On a blistering summer day in Iowa, the idea is hard to avoid for farmers such as Leon Sheets, a pork producer from the northeast of the state who also maintains 600 acres of row crops.“Hey, let’s have the conversation. Let’s work out a deal,” Sheets says, emulating the kind of language one might expect from Donald Trump.When prodded further, Sheets acknowledges\u0026nbspthat he hopes to see a post-Brexit trade deal that would allow for the introduction of products that have previously been off the table: “That’s what the goal is – no restrictions, so products can move freely back and forth.”It is an issue that has received backing from prominent American farming executives, even if some lip service has been given to having “a conversation” about the US food standards that have worried some in the UK.Currently farming exports to Britain – including wine, nuts and fruit – are worth only about $1.8bn (£1.47bn), a fraction of the total overall sales of $133bn. That means there is potentially massive room for growth, under the right circumstances.With the US saying that the UK will be “first in line” for a trade deal following Brexit, Zippy Duvall, the head of the American Farm Bureau, recently said that they are eagerly watching for ways to begin a trade partnership – but that Britain had to accept US standards.PM warned US trade deal ‘highly unlikely’ if Ireland has hard borderGovernment finally hands firms customs numbers for post-Brexit tradeTrump vows to continue China trade war even if recession hits USAs Britain seeks new trade deals, can we learn a lesson from Poldark?UK told to accept US food standards in any trade deal“You know, here in America we treat our water with chlorine,” Duvall, a poultry farmer himself, told the BBC.He claimed it was not a public health issue, saying: “So there is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with chlorine wash just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market should be taken away. If there was something wrong with it our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Chlorine-washed bagged salads are sold in the UK and other countries in the EU, for instance.But what is of concern is that relying on chlorine washes – which proponents say makes harmful bacteria virtually undetectable – at the end of the process allows farmers to keep unsanitary conditions for the chickens earlier on. And the wash could allow for crowded abattoirs where disease could theoretically spread with greater ease.While it is tricky to compare the rates of food-borne illnesses between two countries, two separate studies would suggest that the US experiences higher rates of salmonella infection. One British government study from 2014 found that there were roughly 55 salmonella infections per 100,000 people, when analysing 2009 data. A separate study of the US found a rate of 350 infections per 100,000 people, using data from 2002-08.When it comes to deaths, the US also reports higher numbers. While the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reports around 380 deaths a year due to food-borne salmonella, England and Wales had zero such deaths between 2006 and 2015, according to the most recently available data from Public Health England.Gail Soutar, the chief European Union exit and international trade adviser for the National Farmers Union (NFU), says there was a considerable level of anxiety that a hasty and chaotic Brexit could leave UK farmers competing against a flood of international goods coming in, and undermining their prices.Soutar says she is particularly concerned at the prospect of a no-deal outcome, and the impact that subsequently high tariffs on UK agricultural products could have. Farmers, she worries, could be threatened by a flood of new goods being brought in from the US, which could undermine efforts to honour European Union standards – with the EU, for now, a much larger trading partner than the US.“There is a concern that we are going to see an increase of imports coming into the UK under a no-deal situation,” she says. “It remains absolutely key that we get a deal with the EU.”UK politicians have at least paid lip service to the notion that standards will not be abandoned in pursuit of a deal, with former environment secretary Michael Gove telling an NFU conference in\u0026nbspFebruary that they would not abandon those requirements “in pursuit of trade deals”.But thousands of miles away in Iowa, the outcome of negotiations between the UK and EU are understandably less of a concern for farmers. Whereas UK farmers may be feeling some anxiety, American farmers are clearly sensing opportunity.Bill Tenneger, a pig producer in northwest Iowa, says\u0026nbspDonald Trump’s trade war with China had been hurting farmers like him, but he thinks Mr Trump could potentially capitalise on a weak negotiating position following Brexit.But he adds\u0026nbsphe hopes\u0026nbspit would help British people out too: “I think trade agreements are good. Hey, it’s a small world. We’ve all got to get along in the world. I’ve travelled all over the world representing the pork industry.“In the end, I don’t care what culture you go to or you get embedded in, they all just want to feed their families and support their families and have the government leave them alone.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Or perhaps it’s gingerism Either way, it’s smoke-and-mirrors nonsense designed to deflect from the reality that the public is wearied and irritated by the constant proselytising of a young couple who don’t appear to practise what they preach.This is the problem when Royal Family members abandon the monarchy’s long-held tenet of “never complain, never explain” and start making political statements about how the proles should live their lives.It’s an obvious side-effect that, emboldened by the proleration of social media, one’s once loyal subjects might rise up and have a few strident opinions of their own.Particularly when they’ve just contributed £.million for your “cottage” to be done up.Sir Elton John — with whom they have been staying on their most recent holiday to Nice — appears to blame the media for what he claims was a “distorted and malicious” account of the trip, adding for good measure that he wanted to protect the young couple from the “unnecessary press intrusion that contributed to Diana’s untimely death”.MOST READ IN OPINION\" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   TM-comp-Tony-Parson-.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTONY PARSONS Be the Duchess of Woke or jet-setter, Meghan, but you cant be both \" data-srcset\"https:i.wp www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg croppx%Cpx%Cpx%Cpxresize%Cssl\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentSUN ON SUNDAY SAYS BoJos storming start to G summit shows hes ready to fight for Britain \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-Brendan-ONeill.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentBRENDAN ONEILL Why so glum for those on Planet Remain  Were loving it on Planet Brexit \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMP-IRA.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentLEO MCKINSTRY The Troubles could come back with a vengeance as New IRA rears its ugly head \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-rod-liddle.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentROD LIDDLE Public is tiring of Meghan, Harry, Andrew and Williams whining and hypocrisy \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN SAYS Were not negotiating with the EU over Brexit, were talking to a brick wall Hmmm. Putting aside the observation thatyou want to avoid press coverage then boarding a private plane to stay with an A-lister is perhaps ill-advised, it’s widely acknowledged that Princess Diana was safely ensconced inside the Paris Ritz when she and Dodi took the fateful decision to leave their suite at midnight and get in a car that, unbeknown to them, was being driven by someone . times over the limit and speeding.A French judicial investigation concluded that the photographers were not near the Mercedes when it crashed.But eventhey had been, just like the detracting cry of “racism”, Harry’s tragic loss of his mother shouldn’t be used to try to shut down valid criticism about him and Meghan virtue-signalling their “woke” credentials then hopping on four flights that emit an estimated seven tonnes of CO.Judging by online message boards, the Diana-loving public certainly aren’t buying it.I’ve been a journalist for a long time and know that, whatever I choose to write, people make up their own mind about the issues of the day.And the majority view on the royal couple’s gas-guzzling transportation is that it’s hypocritical.Equally, climate change activists say the same. Or are they being misquoted by the evil media Harry’s impeccably dutul grandmother the Queen understands that the role of the Royal Family is to turn up to a community centre on a wet and windy day and shake the hands of those in society who put in real graft on behalf of others — therefore highlighting a good cause and hopefully encouraging others to do their bit.In other words, leading by example rather than constantly telling everyone how they should be thinking and feeling.Particularly when the Smiths of Acacia Avenue are being made to feel guilty for boarding a budget airline on their one week’s holiday a year and don’t have multi-millionaire friends to offset their carbon foot-print with an “appropriate contribution” to a climate change initiative.It’s a simple truth that, were the Sussexes buckling down and just quietly getting on with their royal duties like Princess Anne et al, they could visit Beyonce George Elton whoever on privately-funded luxury flights and few would question it.But entitled “do as we say, not as we do” hypocrisy should always be called out.IT was perhaps inevitable that the marriage of Strictly pro dancers Neil and Katya Jones would hit the rocks after that kiss.After all, the encounter between Katya and her Strictly  partner Seann Walsh wasn’t just any old snog, it was a Marks  Spencer’s chocolate pudding snog – all dark and mysterious with an explosive centre.It was furtive, hurried, messy and forbidden – everything that a kiss within the confines of a long-term relationship rarely is.However drunk you are, you only kiss someone like that when you’re a a teenager at the local disco or b looking for something, or someone, that’s missing from what you already have.And that’s a tough reality to move on from.Bruised by the humiliation of glaring headlines and the unremitting scrutiny of the public gaze, it’s understandable that they deployed “nothing to see here” mode – swearing undying love for each other and clamping on fixed smiles for any photographer within a -yard radius.But behind closed doors, the recriminations clearly began and, ten months on, their -year relationship is over.The end of a marriage is always sad but, all credit to them, they have vowed to remain friends and professional dancing partners.Now they can both kiss who they want.THE new leader of Ukip is a Richard Braine – a name that has led to plenty of “Dick Braine” ­joshing and articles about other people with ­unfortunate monikers.One of them being my nemesis on a charity edition of The Chase. “Which of these is a Dutch politician ” Bradley Walsh asked me . . . for £,.Ruud Bum, Luuk Bonkers or Tiny Kox were the options and I went for Ruud on the basis footballer Ruud Gullit was from the Netherlands and no one who spoke English as well as the Dutch do would call their son Tiny Kox.But, as this photo shows, I was shocked to learn it was Tiny Kox, a Dutch senator and Socialist Party­ member.He’ll fit right in should he choose to pay a visit to Corbyn and his comrades.FORMER Page  favourite Linda Lusardi is now  and has posed in the same gold bikini she wore in her modelling heyday.If anything, she looks better in it now.She credits her youthful look to good genes and not eating unless she’s hungry, but there’s another crucial factor too – happiness.Linda has been married to actor Sam Kane for  years and a more easy-going, devoted couple you could not wish to find.She says: “I’m in a good place. I have a very happy le, happy marriage and two great kids who are doing what they want to do. That’s all I need.”Indeed. Inner contentment is the greatest anti-ageing formula there is.Don’t I know it.In Mexico, The Bloke said: “Seen one old building, seen ’em all,” as I headed off to Chichen Itza and he headed for a sun lounger.And when I once suggested a safari in Africa, he replied: “No thanks, I’ll watch it on the Discovery Channel.”I got him to come to Rome’s Colosseum once, but only because it was raining and there was a recommended restaurant right opposite.Dear reader, I married him.MICHAEL Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones have posted a charming photograph of a family lunch that includes their two teenage children, Michael’s brothers and nephews, and his once troubled son Cameron from his first marriage.Now , Cameron – who credits Catherine and Michael for sticking by him – has turned a corner and is happily married with a young daughter.Also there were Michael’s dad Kirk, , and stepmum Anne, .Proof,needed, that Hollywood royalty or not, every family has its ups and downs and all that matters as your le nears its end are the loving people that  surround  you.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The private jets to climate change summits. The gobsmackingly expensive renovations to their house with wallpaper made of organic kale and goji berries, or something.It was reported this week that the Royal Family’s bill for travel and security has almost doubled since . Much of that is probably Meghan.But I think people are also weary of William seemingly talking about depression every time he opens his mouth.Hell, you’re depressed, Wills  Howja think the rest of us feel I’ve always been marginally in favour of having a royal family.But that’s contingent upon who that royal family actually is. And how they behave.The Queen and Prince Philhave been models of decency and duty. They keep a certain distance from the public and that is perhaps why they are so adored.To her immense credit, Princess Anne has followed that blueprint. She doesn’t emote for the media and lecture us.My worry is that the newer generation of royals will turn the British public against the Windsors. In Andrew’s case, befriending a scumbag has brought disgrace upon him and the family firm.With Harry and Meghan and William, it’s a case of trying to be too modern and thus losing sight of what it means to be a member of the Royal Family.Keep on this track and we won’t have a royal family for very much longer.A FADING reality star called Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace has had a mega boob implant.

And you see it in opinion polls, too.Much to the horror of the Brexit-bashing elites, polls show that ordinary people do not think No Deal will be the end of the world as we know it.A recent Opinium poll asked people what we should doBoris Johnson fails to wring concessions from the EU and to change the Withdrawal Agreement to make it more palatable to MPs.A whopping  per cent said we should go ahead with Brexit on October  — Boris’s ­promised exit day — evenwe don’t have a deal.Just  per cent said we should cancel Brexit altogether and  per cent said we should continue with negotiations.This echoes a YouGov poll from a few months ago. It asked what we should dothe EU refused to grant an extension to talks on the exit deal.Forty-four per cent said we should say adios without a deal. Forty-two per cent said we should revoke Brexit and stay bound to Brussels.This is all incredibly revealing. No, it does not suggest millions of us are reckless and crazy and hell-bent on jumping off the “clf edge”.Most Brits, including Boris himself, would prefer to leave with a deal,a good one can be struck.No, what the polls show is that there is only so much baloney from the EU that we are willing to take.If Eurocrats carry on behaving stubbornly and arrogantly by refusing to reopen talks about the Withdrawal Agreement, then we should show some self-respect and walk away — that is what people are saying.This captures one of the key ides between the elites and ordinary people today. The political and media classes dread No Deal because they have lost faith in Britain.They view the UK as a tiny, pathetic island that could never possibly cope outside of the EU.They think we need to be looked after by the apparently caring, maternal figure of the Brussels bureaucracy. Andwe do the political equivalent of cutting the apron strings, we will be doomed, apparently.In the rest of the country, meanwhile, people have far more faith in the nation.They believe we are more than capable of being a sovereign, independent country that strikes its own trade deals and writes its own laws.They see the country not as a useless little island, but as a plucky, resourceful nation that should reach out to the world without being beholden to any of it.The ide over No Deal reveals how much disagreement there is between the political elites and the people today.It is hard to remember a time when the chasm between Us and Them was as wide as it is right now.The th Century Prime ­Minister Benjamin Disraeli once said the UK feels like “two nations”. In one nation there are the posh and well-educated, and in the other there are ­ordinary working people.These “two nations” have entirely dferent “habits, thoughts, and feelings”, he wrote. It is asthey are “inhabitants of dferent planets”.It feels like that again today. On the planet of the Remainer elites, No Deal will be terrible, Boris is the worst PM ever, and anyone who ­disagrees is probably a racist.But on the planet inhabited by the rest of us, No Deal will be fine. And support for the Boris-led Conservative Party is rising. Surging, in fact.The latest Britain Elects ­opinion poll shows that  per cent of us would vote for the Tories, compared with just  per cent for Labour.From their increasingly isolated planet, the chattering classes rage against No Deal, denounce Boris as “far Right”, and bad-mouth Britain.But their shrill cries make no impact on our planet. In our more sane world, we still want Brexit to happen and we think Britain is a good, decent, capable country.The elites should come over to our planet.

Keep your home as cool as possible – shading windows and shutting them during the day may help.Open them when it is cooler at night. Avoid too much exercise, which can cause heat exhaustion or heat stroke, and watch for signs of heat stress - an early sign is fatigue.Drink plenty of fluids, but not alcohol, which dehydrates the body. If theres anybody you know, for example an older person living on their own, who might be at special risk, make sure they know what to do.Brits have also warned to stay inside and out of the sun between am and pm to avoid suffering from heat or sun stroke or sunburn and to drink plenty of water.Those most at risk are young children, the elderly and people with underlying health conditions such as asthma.The Met Office has issued amber, yellow and green health alerts across the country lasting from am on Saturday until am on Monday.A level  heatwave alert was issued for parts of eastern England, which means temperatures can be dangerous to health for three days straight.Level two and one alerts are in place for London, the south east and the north, where there is a  per cent chance heat levels will become unbearable for at least two days.As millions take to the road for short breaks, experts have warned the hot weather could cause more breakdowns.RAC spokesman Rod Dennis said: “With summer ing in time for the weekend for many of us, it’s going to mean millions of us take to the road for day trips and short breaks.“Unfortunately, as the temperature rises so can the chances

Over the next few months, Charlie became obsessed with Emma’s right breast, taking every opportunity to snf at her.‘I began to feel worried,’ she recalls, ‘and had a growing sense that she was trying to tell me something, so I decided to examine my boobs.aposWhen I found a small lump, I was horried, and ran my fingers over it again and again to make sure I wasn’t going mad.aposBut it was definitely there.’ Emma went straight to her GP, who referred her for tests.Just a few days later, she was called in to see a consultant where she was given the awful news she had breast cancer.‘I was so shocked and frightened,’ she says.   ‘One of my aunts had breast cancer at a young age, but somehow I didn’t think it would happen to me.’ Emma was told she’d need a mastectomy, followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy.‘I got home and just broke down as I told my mum,’ she says.‘The idea of losing my breast was horric, but mum reassured me that we would get through it together.aposThankfully, my cancer was at stage one, and doctors were sure they could remove it.’ A lesaver Telling Ben and Jack that she had cancer was incredibly tough for Emma.‘I sat them down and told them there was something bad inside me, but that the hospital were going to help me get it out,’ she says. ‘Thankfully, they took it in their stride and were brave, which gave me confidence as I went into hospital.’ Even in her darkest hours, Emma knew she owed her le to her little pup.‘I couldn’t stop thinking thatit hadn’t been for Charlie, I might not have checked.aposI knew she was trying to warn me,’ says Emma.‘I’d read about dogs snfing out illnesses before, but I hadn’t believed it.aposI gave Charlie the biggest hug and told her what a clever girl she was.’ Emma’s mastectomy went well, and slowly but surely she began to recover.Her consultant explained thatshe’d waited any longer before having treatment, the cancer would have spread rapidly, leaving Emma in no doubt that Charlie was her furry little hero. Over the next few weeks, chemotherapy left Emma feeling exhausted and sick.‘Charlie was by my side whenever I felt unwell,’ she says. ‘Some days, all I wanted to do was lie in bed and feel sorry for myself, and she’d come and give me a gentle nudge.aposKnowing she needed a walk would always get me up and out, and the fresh air would do wonders.’ After her course of chemotherapy, Emma moved onto radiotherapy, and wept with relief when the treatment finished in September .At once, Charlie stopped following Emma around and nudging her chest, and went back to being a boisterous little dog.Thankfully, Emma’s cancer is now in remission, and this month she will attend her final oncologist appointment.Charlie is still very much a loving, devoted part of the family. ‘I’m so glad I can put this behind me,’ says Emma.‘I owe Charlie my le and she deserves all the doggy treats in the world.aposShe’s my best friend.aposFor me and Charlie, it really is puppy love.apos  Meet Daisy: The Labrador who has detected  cases of cancer Ten-year old Daisy received the Blue Cross Medal for bravery and heroism after snfing more than , samples and detecting over  cases of cancer during her time as a bio detection dog. ‘Dogs can smell changes that humans can’t,’ says her owner, Dr Claire Guest.‘I’ve been taken into a vast room full of equipment at Manchester University and been told that it has the power of Daisy’s nose.’She was inspired to set up the Medical Detection Dogs charity after Daisy detected her own breast cancer back in .Dr Guest had been working as a psychologist, specialising in interactions between humans and dogs, when Daisy began acting in a weird way.‘Daisy kept pawing at my chest one day, which alarmed me,’ says Dr Guest.‘I got it checked out and was told I had early stage breast cancer."},{"url":null,"title":"i thought boy fussy eater","story":"NewsI thought my boy was a fussy eater - but it was actually a big red flagWhen Jo Black adopted a cat called Chi for her son Finley, she didn’t realise it would change their lives so dramatically…ShareCommentsByRuth AddicottRosie Hopegood:,  AUG NewsFinley loves his cat Chi, who has helped him overcome a multitude of problems\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Exhausted and not eating aposThe diagnosis was a relief. aposI stopped apologising and I was able to explain that Finley wasn’t being dficult, he was just having a dficult time. aposWe read books and went on courses to try to better understand his needs. But mealtimes remained a battle. aposHe wouldn’t eat any protein like meat, fish, cheese or eggs, or anything in a sauce or breadcrumbs. aposThe only things he would eat were chips, broccoli, beans, fruit, brown bread and yoghurt. aposIf it had an unusual taste or texture, he’d panic and projectile vomit. aposHe was sick so much, he had to have teeth removed because of the acid. aposWe tried small portions and putting things on dferent plates. We tried distracting him. aposWe tried focusing on the food and messy play to get him used to the idea of textures. aposWe made no progress at all. aposWe went through mental health services and no one could suggest anything that helped. aposIt was exhausting. aposFinley wasn’t eating. We weren’t eating. aposI got to the point where I hated food. aposIf he caught even a whf of the slow cooker or a Sunday roast, he’d run upstairs and hide under a blanket. aposIt was either food wasted, or the same boring things again.  aposFinley then developed his phobia of crisps – I don’t knowit was the texture, orhis lips had got sore from the salt. aposHe saw my mum eating crisps once and he wouldn’t give her a hug, even though she’d washed her hands. aposAlthough Finley has his issues at mealtimes, he tries very hard. aposOnce, when he was four,he asked me why so many illnesses are to do with animals. aposI said, ‘What do you mean ’ He said, ‘Like chicken pox and having a frog in your throat.’ aposThen he said, ‘Is that why when I’m sick you give me Cowpol ’ He is very funny and likeable, and without anything being said, his year group took on a kind of mothering role. aposI’d see him coming out of class and there would be children helping him put on his coat. aposHe was invited to a birthday party and the little boy whose party it was came up to me and said, ‘Can Finley come to my birthday party  I promise there’ll be no crisps.’ aposI think children are very accepting in a way some adults aren’t. aposFinley loves the library because it’s quiet and has books about dinosaurs, but one day, he opened a book and had a huge meltdown. aposI don’t knowit had a funny smell or something, but this lady came up and said, ‘When I took my children out when they were young, I made sure they behaved.’ aposI felt so ashamed and stupid, thinking, you have no idea. aposFinley may have his moments, but he is my little boy who I love.  aposWhen Finley was seven, he was diagnosed with autism, which not only explained his meltdowns, but why he was so exhausted at the end of the day. aposHe didn’t want to leave the house, he would come home from school and literally shake and hide in the corner.  Feline help aposOver the holidays, he was becoming increasingly isolated, so in  we decided to adopt a rescue cat. aposWe went to the shelter and there was a little kitten who had been abandoned, she took one look at Finley and literally jumped into his arms. aposHe named her Chi after a cartoon character, and the two of them became inseparable. aposChi followed Finley everywhere, she’d run up to greet him when he came in from school, and sit with him for hours while he’d talk about his day. aposChi treats Finley like her kitten, she even tries to clean him and covers him with hugs. aposAnything he is doing she is sitting ft away watching intently. A furry saviour aposAt night, I’d see this tiny ball of fur sitting at the top of the stairs waiting for him to wake up, and as soon as she heard his voice in the morning, she’d run in and smother him with affection, and he’d start the day with a smile. aposI think it’s also the sensory thing – Chi is soft and warm, she is a pressure when she sits on him, and I think that helps with his anxiety. aposThey have such a lovely, quiet companionship.  aposCommunication can be a barrier with autism. aposFinley talks non-stop, he’ll chat for  minutes without drawing breath. aposIf you’re speaking to a person, they’ll start giving out body language that they’re done with the conversation, or start interrupting so they can get a word in, but cats don’t. aposChi is a comforting presence. aposHe can talk to her for hours about dinosaurs and she’ll sit and listen. aposAlthough mealtimes can still be a battle, Chi has helped with Finley’s anxiety so much, it has been transformative. aposHe is so much more relaxed, we have inspired other families with autistic children to adopt a rescue cat.

She had spent the day in Washington on a fruitless quest to interview former Vice President Spiro Agnew. It was part of a one-month tryout with an American weekly newspaper that paid her extraordinarily well - far more than her usual newspaper could afford thanks to the country’s current economic crisis. Sandy had no plans for the evening and was nervous at the prospect of drinking alone in the South. Atlanta wasn’t London, where the pubs in Soho were so familiar to her they ed as a second home. As she wrote a few years later, years of pulling in pubs and clubs had taught her that, despite being a bit broad in the beam and not exactly a raving beauty, she had a magnetism that drew men asto a pile of iron filings. Sandy was single, in her mid-forties.She could travel, pursue flings with younger men — early to mid-twenties was the ideal range — drink heavily without a hangover and keep her primary focus on her work.  Sandy wasn’t alone at the Holiday Inn bar long. A young man she’d eyed earlier with some disdain for wearing a flowery tie to match his shirt walked towards her. Would you like to dance  he asked. Well, no, thank you She’d been thrown by his advance, but seeing the rejection cross his face, she blurted out: I have only just arrived in town and haven’t had a drink all day….I have to go to work. I am a journalist, you see. He replied: Will you be gone long  Will you come back  Are you staying here  Sandy wasn’t gone long.The Atlanta Constitution office proved disappointing.She came back, and the redheaded six-footer with a classically handsome face topped by hair the colour of scotch and water that complimented her own flaming red hair, was still in the bar when she ed. This time, she accepted his invitation to dance. He told her he was on his way to Miami. That’s funny, said Sandy, I’m going to West Palm Beach tomorrow. “You should let me drive you there,” said the man. “It only takes a day and you could see something of the country.” Sandy mulled over his suggestion. How  would she see America as it was, not the America constrained by tight deadlines and formal interviews  Plus, he seemed to be an experienced traveler. Earlier, the young man rattled off a list of cities and states visited - New Orleans, Houston, Dallas, Kentucky, St. Louis. Alabama. She decided to accept, on one condition. “I’m not going to bed with you. Oh, I know you haven’t asked, but it sure ain’t dficult to read your thoughts!” Besides, Sandy continued: “I don’t know anything about you, you could easily be another Boston Strangler for all I know!”  Both burst out laughing. Within hours, Sandy would take the younger man to bed, though the experience would prove underwhelming. “So you’re not really another Boston Strangler after all,” she said, after. “What a disappointment.” Days later, Sandy would learn how wrong she was, and what danger she’d been in the entire time. An experienced reporter Sandy had found success as a fashion editor and when she grew restless with greater ambition, joined the Daily Mail and the , where she moved into feature journalism. She was a lone woman among throngs of men, and felt it was necessary to outdrink, outlast, and outwit them. She was fun to be with. And that was before what happened in America in November . Sandy wondered why she had agreed to the man’s offer of a ride to West Palm Beach. He was attractive and young, yes. But the sex wasn’t all that great. His conversation revolved around recurring visions of a shortened leI don’t know when, but within a year I shall be dead. I am going to be killed by someone and of audio tapes secreted away in his lawyer’s vault. Was any of it true, or was the man, who had finally given his name as Lester Daryl Golden, putting her on And why on earth was he determined that she write a book about him     Meanwhile, people kept dying with alarming speed. -year-old Alice Curtis, choked to death in her own home in Jacksonville, Florida.Mylette and Lillian Anderson, sisters aged just seven and  whose bodies were never found. A teenage girl whose name wasn’t known for decades. Marjorie Howie, , strangled with her nylon stocking, television set pilfered from her apartment. Women and girls, all dead between August  and , . The spree didn’t stop with those victims. Kathie Sue Pierce, strangled in her Musella, Georgia home on August  in front of her three-year-old son, who escaped harm. William Bates, picked up at a roadside pub in Lima, Ohio on September , his nude body not discovered for another month. By that time Emmett and Lois Johnson were found shot to death at an Ely, Nevada campsite on September  Charlynn Hicks, raped and strangled in Seguin, Texas and Ann Dawson, a beautician missing from Birmingham, Alabama as of September . Worse was still to come in October and November.Karen Wine and her -year-old daughter, Dawn, both raped in their Marlborough, Connecticut home on October , both strangled with a nylon stocking. Doris Hosey, , shot to death two days later in Woodford, Virginia.Edward Hilliard and Debbie Grfin, choosing the wrong car to hitchhike with on November , with him ending up murdered, and her body never recovered. Carswell Carr, befriended by his killer over drinks in Milledgeville, Georgia, only to be stabbed to death on November , after which his -year-old daughter, Mandy, died by strangulation. Sandy knew none of this. Not until she spied the front page of the local paper that Daryl purchased on November , the day they finally left Atlanta. A page devoted entirely to the recent spate of murders. But she wanted to get to Florida. She’d drunk too much the night before. She didn’t much care about Daryl’s assertion that he had friends in Macon, about  miles from Milledgeville. And she certainly didn’t recall saying to him in bed the night before that she didn’t think he was a “maxi-murderer at all, more your mini-murderer. That fleeting look of irritation  No, this was a joke best left alone. Once in West Palm Beach on November , Sandy did find Daryl useful. He drove her to the local office of the paper she was trying out with.He drove her to the house of Florida attorney general William Saxbe so she could conduct an interview, and waited in the car until she was finished. But the next day, after a heart-stopping near-loss of materials, as well as a more pressing looming deadline, Sandy knew it was over. The sex hadn’t been worth much to begin with, but now there was little point keeping on. “I hate saying [the words] but I’m going back to London on Saturday and I have a lot of work to do and people to see before I go.” But before they parted, she had to know - would Daryl tell her what was on the tapes  He would not.    “In that case I have to concentrate on my own business…but it’s been a marvellous week, Daryl, wonderful, truly like a holiday. However, le must take over again.” Couldn’t they spend just one more night together, asked Daryl. “No, darling. No.” Sandy was firm: “Goodbyes are horrible but they’re better over and done with.” She kissed him on the mouth one last time, and felt “free to come and go and please herself again. She spent that evening at a bar with some other American journalists, who teased her about ditching a clearly heartbroken Daryl. The next day, Sandy received an urgent message from West Palm Beach police detective sergeant Gabbard. When she arrived at the station, she thought perhaps Daryl had had an accident. When Gabbard askedshe knew of a Susan MacKenzie, Sandy said she did, vaguely.She was the we of one of the journalists she’d gone out drinking with the prior night. “Your friend attempted to rape her this morning.” Sandy, stunned, blurted out a response she would regret for the rest of her le: “Good God…and he wasn’t even a good poke!”After a beat of silence, she asked Gabbard to fill her in. “Mrs. MacKenzie says that when he was driving her to the hairdresser’s this morning when he pulled the car off the road and asked her to make love to him. When she refused he pulled a gun on her.”  Susan managed to get out of the car, despite Daryl grabbing her by the hair, and called police from a nearby pay phone.Despite being spotted by a squad car, Daryl had escaped, though police now knew the make and model of his car. By the time he was arrested on November , after a shootout involving multiple officers from several law enforcement agencies, helicopters, and dogs, Daryl had killed two more people. Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Charles Campbell, who’d failed in his own attempt at an arrest and ended up a hostage and James Meyer, kidnapped so that the man could swap a police car for a less obtrusive one. By the time the killer and the abducted duo reached a remote, wooded area in Pulaski, Georgia, the hostages’ fate was clear: both were handcuffed to a tree and shot to death. Over the next few days, Sandy learned the gruesome truth about her week-long lover -his real name was Paul John Knowles, and he was suspected in the deaths of at least  people. “Exactly a week ago I had been in his arms,” wrote Sandy.“How could I have made such a mistake  Then, like hot metal flooding my veins, came the memory of that first morning, the sense of evil in the room that had thrust me headlong to the door. Good God, I had known.” Knowles was well-acquainted with Florida’s foster homes and reformatories, given up by his father after a juvenile conviction for petty crime. He married, young and briefly.

Up to  people from the UK are thought to have been laid low by susp­ected norovirus at the four-star accommodation on the Greek island of Zante. It is claimed the reports of guests suffering severe vomiting and diarrhoea began four months ago but travel firm Jet has continued to send tourists there despite knowing about the issue. One couple became so ill they spent eight hours on a medication drip at a private health clinic. The pair – former nurse Gwen Yapp, , and husband Tony,  – of Bridgnorth, Shropshire, had paid £, for their week-long holiday in May.    Gwen, who has diabetes and is registered disabled, said: “It was a nightmare. The holiday was ruined. We spent most of it in our room. I reported it to the rep in May and to Jet when I came home. “They said they could not be held responsible for a virus in the hotel.” The Avalon Hotel has a notice warn­ing of the problem. It gives health and safety advice and says the bug is “going around the island”.  Jane Shields, , fell ill this month on the second week of a £, holiday and spent two days in her room. The NHS worker and her husband Steven, , from Huddersfield, West Yorks, spoke to a Jet rep at a hotel meeting. Jane said: “I said, ‘You need to stop sending people here because you are going to kill somebody’.” Clare Wood, , and boyfriend Craig Tooby, , arrived at the hotel last week­end for a £, all-inclusive break.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGrinning from ear to ear in a cute holiday snap, little Mylee Billingham doesn’t have a care in the world. But just months later, the eight-year-old’s le was cruelly snuffed out with a kne by her evil dad William. Authorities took no steps to monitor -year-old Billingham’s contact with her – despite him being a violent criminal with a history of domestic abuse. Last week we revealed Mylee was one of  kids killed after they were left alone with known abusive parents. Now, in a heartbreaking interview, Mylee’s mum Tracey Taundry is backing our crusade to change the law and Save Kids From Violent Parents.  Tracey, , who was forced to listen to Mylee begging “Stop it, Daddy” as Billingham stabbed her to death behind a closed door, said: “No violent criminal should be left alone with a child. “I just wish I could switch places with Mylee. My le has changed and I’ll never be the person I was.” Tracey also slammed authorities for not warning her about Billingham’s background, saying she would have taken legal action in a bid to stop him accessing their daughtersshe had known the extent of his violence. She said: “Why wasn’t I told about his previous conviction  He also had children with exes who would be in the same situation as mine were. “Social workers must have known about his record. I could kick myself. “I wish I could go back and stop him from seeing my children but I would have been accused of being a bad parent and using them as a weapon. “I wanted them to have what any child would want, a mum, a dad. I didn’t believe in split Christmases so he’d come at Christmas. There was no ‘these are dad’s presents, these are mum’s presentsapos, none of that because that’s not how I wanted it to be. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror    “He’d always been fine with the girls. I had no reason to believe that he was capable of doing something like that. “He’d been horrible to me in the past but not against my kids, never.” Tracey, of Walsall, West Midlands, also revealed that Billingham has refused to give up his parental rights to their two surviving girls – even though he is now serving le in jail. He is entitled to regular updates on the other kids and has a say in medical treatment and education. Tracey even needs permission to take them on holiday. He can also bar the girls from changing their surname. Tracey said: “How can the man who murdered my daughter have control over my children  Why should he know about their welfare  He lost all rights when he killed Mylee. “He doesn’t want me to be able to move on and, by having control of the kids, he has control of me. One of my daughters was called a ‘murderer in the making’ because of her surname.” WHAT WE ARE CALLING FOR . A change in the law, which means anyone who has been convicted of violent crime, child abuse or sexual offences can’t have automatic, unsupervised access to their kids. The same rules would apply to those who’d had similar findings made against them in the civil courts. The ban could only be overturned by a judgethe parent had undergone a thorough assessment by an independent expert proving they have been rehabilitated. . Mandatory, standardised training in domestic abuse for judges, social workers and any other professionals involved in child access arrangements. We also want to see domestic abuse training for coroners overseeing domestic homicide inquests. . More State funding to support the hundreds of thousands of children in the UK affected by domestic abuse – including the , kids currently being supported by Refuge. It is only with the right support, such as specialist therapy, that these children can recover from the trauma they have experienced.   Tracey’s world imploded when Mylee was killed on an access visit in January . Billingham was furious because Tracey was in a new relationship, even though they had split up years earlier. Authorities had not checked Mylee was safe with her father even though he had a s conviction for ABH relating to a previous girlfriend, of which Tracey was unaware. His murder trial at Birmingham Crown Court also heard claims he had threatened to jump from a balcony while holding his son from a past relationship. Tracey said thatshe had known about his background she would have taken legal action, even though it might not have succeeded. Our nine-month probe has shown that even when cases reach the family courts, judges often grant unsupervised access to violent criminal parents. The Children Act, introduced in , was designed to ensure the welfare of children comes first. But it does not specically ban anyone convicted of violent crimes, sexual offences or child abuse from unsupervised access.  Tracey said social services did visit her after Billingham was cautioned for assaulting her when Mylee was small. But she claimed they did not make clear how violent he’d been in the past, or how his behaviour put her kids at risk She said: “Nothing was really explained. I wasn’t aware of anything but my own situation.” A serious case review was commissioned in the wake of Mylee’s death, which found authorities failed to record key details about Billingham’s abuse. It also found that professionals failed to make checks to ensure Tracey and her kids were safe. Tracey is now tortured by the thought that her evil ex could have killed all three of their girls. Tracey, who has started her own petition for Myleeaposs Law to remove parental rights from people convicted of serious crimes, said: “He killed Mylee to spite me. That makes me, as Mylee’s mummy, quite grateful to Mylee because in a way, it’s like she died so her sisters didn’t have too. I do believe, as hard as it is for me to admit,it wasn’t Mylee, it would have been all three. If I could change it, I would make it me. I would switch my le for hers. You can sign the petition for Myleeaposs Law here. Our campaign is being backed by a raft of charities and MPs. Shadow home office minister Carolyn Harris said: “The idea children need both parents is admirable but a dangerous parent is a threat.” Refuge chief Sandra Horley said: “We want an end to the presumption that parental contact is always positive.”  Tracey carries on for the sake of her surviving children and is incredibly calm when she speaks about the terrible events of January . “It’s a coping mechanism. I don’t want to get up in the morning. I have to. I don’t have a choice because I’m their mum and I’ve got to look after them, she said. I want to look after them. I don’t want other people to look after them because I’m not in the right frame of mind. In the beginning, that was very dficult. I had a lot of family around me helping me to look after the girls. “I haven’t grieved properly. People say ‘oh this far down the line, you moving on ’ No, I can never move on.   Some days everything is fine. Then I remember Mylee is not there. It’s the little things, like when I buy a pack of three chocolates and have one left and I shouldnapost have and now I can’t help but keep buying that pack of three chocolates. Things like that. I’ve always shouted their names in order and itaposs always on the tip of my tongue to say Myleeaposs name.  Traceyaposs eldest daughter has launched a bid to change her surname because of the cruel aposmurderer in the makingapos taunts. “I just want my kids to grow up and be okay and not carry that stigma of that name because for them, it’s not fair, said Tracey. “My eldest has got her own opinions, she wants to change her name. She knows what happened to her sister. “My daughter is nearly . She has her own mind to think what she would like. Why should she have to carry a name that she doesn’t want ” Tracey refuses to speak negatively about Billingham in front of her children - and has banned others from speaking out. She said: “I’ve never slagged him off in front of her. I don’t think itaposs right. I’m their mum, not their enemy. I don’t want to put thoughts in their head. “My youngest daughter is autistic so doesn’t understand a great deal. But my eldest daughter who is really bright, a clever girl, knows. But no, I’ve not let anyone  say anything.  “Bad words are not said against him. In fact I don’t give him my thoughts because he’s not worth it in that sense. “I don’t talk about him. “That uses my energy and itaposs bad energy. I don’t like it.  “It doesn’t mean I condone what he did. “I hate him for it. But I’m not going to waste my good energy. And Mylee was a good child. “She gave everyone a fair chance and I don’t believe in using my children as a weapon like he did. “So to speak badly of him to my children would make me a terrible person.. That would be me using them as a weapon and that is not who I am. I would never do that. Billingham was sentenced to le with a minimum term of  years at Birmingham Crown Court in October last year. Tracey was forced to recount every minute of the horric incident in court - as the sick dad refused to show remorse and claimed he could not remember the killing. She said:  “It was traumatic to give evidence. I had to do it and I would do the same thing tomorrowit meant he was found guilty. Of course. I looked at it like I was doing my bit for Mylee. “But I had to go to court to give evidence, yet he didn’t have to get on the stand and be cross-examined. That in itself is disgusting to me. “That I had to stand and go through it all again, and tell the story that was in my head constantly anyway. I had to relive it and say it out loud to a jury and people that I didn’t know. And then he gets to say ‘no, I don’t want to get in the box’.  Part of me was like ‘well we know why, because you haven’t got an answer.’ Because you know you’ve done it, even though he said he had memory loss. He knew he did it and there was nothing. Because he said I’ve got memory loss and I can’t remember. He never suffered from memory loss before.  “It was another form of control. People have said to me, aposoh he got le, with a minimum of  yearsapos. Le should mean le actually. And it can’t bring her back. It doesn’t seem long enough. She’d be my age. Mylee would be my agehe’s released then.” Tracey says she doesn’t like to think about the way Mylee died and instead focuses on her wonderful le. She said: “Mylee was perfect. She loved dancing and singing. She would do an after school club every night and then go straight to a dance club. She was really outgoing. She loved scooters, bikes, football. “Mylee was... you know, she’d go out in a tutu with football boots. That was Mylee. “She never cried. She was never upset. She was always smiling. “She never took a side and was popular at school. That’s the type of child Mylee was. “She loved dancing, ballet, ballroom, tap. My laminate floor took the brunt of that with the tap shoes! “She could be mischievous. ‘Oh no, it wasn’t me!’, well it was! “Mylee was very close to her siblings and we celebrate her le by doing lots of things that she would have done. “At Mylee’s school, they’re doing a Mylee garden. As a positive space, not a negative.

The Queen and Prince Philip have been staying at the castle for a few weeks with a rotating cast of the Windsor clan joining them in turn.Scandal hit Prince Andrew has been and gone and this weekend the Cambridges arrived in force to enjoy the wild beauty of the sprawling estate. The family lunched together on Friday. Kate and William were seen clambering in and out of a Range Rover while the Queen drove herself, dressed in classic tartan skirt, woolen jumper and a dark green sleeveless coat.  Mum-of-three Kate was casual in jumper and slacks and carried a rucksack. She looked casual and very relaxed in a setting sure to suit her love of the outdoors. Prince Philip was also seen out and about in the grounds of the castle with his daughter Princess Anne. The Duke of Edinburgh is rarely seen in public ever since his retirement. Peter and Autumn Philips, the latter of whom is the oldest grandchild of the Queen, were also pictured at the estate. The Royals have endured a tough week as questions continue to be asked about Prince Andrewaposs friendship with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. In a statement today the Duke of York said he never saw or suspected any sex crimes during the time he spent with Epstein.  But the denial hasnapost stopped serious questions being raised about his knowledge of Epsteinaposs crimes. Andrew has repeatedly denied any knowledge of Epsteinaposs alleged behaviour, but questions over his wisdom in continuing the friendship have refused to go away. The Duke was not seen in Scotland today, and was last spotted with his bodyguard at the Real Club Valderrama, one of the most exclusive courses in Europe, in southern Spain.  And another headache is the continued criticism of Prince Harry and we Meghan Markle who used a private jet four times in  days while travelling on holiday to Ibiza and the south of France. Both have previously been outspoken in their concerns about climate change. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expected to join the Royals in Balmoral shortly, though it is not thought they have arrived yet, the Daily Mail reported on Friday.

Laura Donegan, , from Coventry, was just  weeks pregnant when her waters broke. But she had no idea this was the case as a doctor had initially told her she had wet herself, she said.Laura, who had lost a lot of fluid, posted her concerns in Facebook group Little Heartbeats and a flurry of mums rushed to advise Laura who then decided to go back to the hospital.She was eventually diagnosed with preterm premature rupture of the membranes three weeks later. If not for the advice from other mums, Laura said she would have risked losing her babies due to infection.    After being signed off work for six weeks, she went on to give birth to her daughters Cara and Evie, at  weeks pregnant on May . Laura, an accountant, said: If I hadnapost have posted into the group about my concerns, Iaposd have never have known about apospreterm premature rupture of the membranesaposand could have easily lost the girls. My first pregnancy went really smoothly, so I had no idea what to do when things started to go wrong. Whilst the doctor told me Iaposd simply wet myself and said to aposcontinue as normalapos, the ladies in the group said I should insist on antibiotics and lie down as much as possible so I didnapost lose too much fluid.  I had to take three weeks off work before I eventually got a doctors note confirming my waters had broke allowing me a further six weeks off before the girls were born. PRROM is where the sac, or the amniotic membrane, ruptures before week  of pregnancy. Once the sac breaks, there is an increased risk of infection and a higher chance of having the babies early - and Laura said this would have been detrimental for her twins.  If it wasnapost for the advice from members of the Facebook page, Laura believes she wouldnapost have managed to hold off her labour until  weeks.

Julie, a college lecturer who has three other teenage daughters, said: “She was addicted to the instant communication on Snapchat. “It’s faster-paced than Facebook or Instagram and she loved that.” Julie claimed Snapchat’s “streak” feature, which tallies direct snaps exchanged between friends over consecutive days, encouraged her addiction. Longer streaks are ­rewarded with special emojis but the tally goes back to zeroa day of messaging is missed. Julie, of Carlisle, Cumbria, is now calling for Ruby’s Law – a ban on ­social media sites for under-s. She said: “I’d like to see the Government and social media s take ­responsibility so we never see another child lose their le due to the virtual world before they’ve lived a le in a real world.” Since Ruby’s death in February , Julie has been piecing together her daughter’s online le by speaking to her friends.  She was horried to realise her daughter posted a string of disturbing messages in the lead-up to her death. On the night before she died, Julie quizzed her daughter about a £ phone bill for mobile data. Ruby sent two messages to friends in Newcastle saying: “I think I might as well kill myself in the morning.” Neither replied, though it is ­unclearanyone saw the messages. Next day she killed herself. A string of teenage suicides have been linked to social media including Molly Russell, , who took her le after viewing self-harm content on Instagram. Jessica Scatterson, , killed herself in Warrington in April  after being emotionally overwhelmed by social media without the skills to cope.  Single mum Julie, who also has twins Kitty and Florry, , and Maisy, , added: “Enough is enough. This stuff is accessible to kids all the time. They are tied into it because everyone  is doing it. They don’t want to be left out. “Ruby would show me a photo of someone, going ‘Why don’t I look like that’ and wishing she didn’t wear glasses. “I told her not everything is like you see on there but she didn’t get it. “She got upset when a photo didn’t get as many likes and asked whether it was because of the way she’d done her ­eyebrows or how she was smiling.She came to my room crying, her bicep ­bleeding. She showed me her arms ­covered in marks, telling me she didn’t feel worthy of love. I felt awful.” Ruby was referred to Child  Adult Mental Health Services for treatment and began regular counselling. She was signed off in July  and the family moved from Newcastle upon Tyne to Carlisle for a fresh start. But her addiction to social media was fuelled as she tried to stay in touch with her old friends. Her messages included: “I might pop down to AE and seethey can stitch my le back together.” Another said: “How I sleep at night knowing I’m a disappointment and ­knowing no one cares about me.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tv baker who lived uk","story":"NewsTV baker who has lived in the UK for  years denied settled status by Home OfficeRichard Bertinet, who has appeared on TV shows like Saturday Kitchen, had to apply for settled status under the EU Settlement SchemeShareCommentsByMichael TaylorSarah LumleyAnna Ye:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video tv-baker-who-lived-uk-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Richard Bertinet, who has been acclaimed as a food champion by the BBC and has appeared on shows like Saturday Kitchen, was born in Brittany, France and has lived in the UK for  years. He runs his own bakery classes and has published a number of books. He also has a British we and three British children. Despite the le he has built for himself here, the Home Office has only granted Mr Bertinet pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme. This means he can remain in the UK for five more years, before needing to apply again.  The governmentaposs website states pre-settled status normally applies to EU citizens without five yearsapos continuous residence upon application. Mr Bertinet, of Bath, said he felt betrayed by the decision but is determined to appeal against it. He shared a photo of the Home Office letter on his Instagram account yesterday. Alongside the photo, he wrote:  years living in the UK without a break for more than a few weeks holiday . Originally employed without gaps then started several businesses employing s of others and one that attracts visitors in to the UK from overseas.    Always paid UK taxes. Married to a British woman for  years with three British children. Have NOT spent  days in five years or  days in  months outside the UK. Submitted all evidence requested, as requested. NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR SETTLED STATUS. Speaking about the Home Office decision, he added: I applied as we watched the news about Brexit and we were worried about having to reapply for residency. He continued: You feel like you spend  years of your le living here but it is not your home, said Mr Bertinet.  There is something not right here. It is something of a betrayal. It is a slap in the face. I have paid taxes, I am grateful for the NHS and I have employed hundreds of people for my businesses. I have never had a British passport as I have a French passport. It leaves a very sour taste in the mouth. When people today say they are embarrassed about their country, you know something is not right. Mr Bertinet said messages of support have come flooding in, including from fellow chef Nigella Lawson.  The letter from the Home Office states: You have permission to stay in the UK for five years from the date of this letter. If you wish to apply for settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, you can do so as soon as you meet the qualying criteria for this. More information on the qualying criteria for the EU Settlement Scheme can be found at:  https:www.gov.uk settled-status-eu-citizens-families when-to-apply . You should make an application when you believe you qualy for settled status and before your pre-settled status experies. You can also rely on any rights that you may have as an EEAor Swiss citizen under EU law whilst those rights remain in force in the UK.

The team of paranormal investigators said it also has video footage of growling and screaming noises at Pool Parc asylum in Ruthin, north Wales. Six ghost hunters from the group Spirit Walkers went into the -year-old manor house armed with specialist equipment including night vision cameras and EVPdevices on August . Beth Hopper, , who runs Spirit Walkers, said they only discovered the haunting images once they ed home. She said one image appears to show a shadowy figure standing next to a noose. The mum from Chester, said: We were filming through a broken window and I just canapost explain the growling sound I heard on the film when I got back to the car.    Itaposs about one minute and five seconds into the footage, I thought: aposWhat the hell is that apos I also got those screams on the electronic voice phenomena. It was quite disturbing. People have said to me they can hear the sound of torture. If you picture the mental asylum and what mightaposve happened there, that might explain it. It is just a horrible sound. Iaposve been there several times and have heard voices and footsteps. One girl said she felt a nurse was standing right in front of her in the dark. Weaposd also heard reports of an ex-patient there who thinks heaposs a Roman soldier and who marches up and down the corridor and throws stones at people.  I was glad to get out of there in the end! But then when we did we saw a noose hanging from a window that we hadnapost spotted with our torches before we went in. It wasnapost until I lightened the picture later that we saw what could be a figure in the window. It was pretty creepy. The spirits could be trying to send a signal of the pain they went through there. My team say spirits are drawn to me because of my bubbly personality. They use our energy so maybe they like me for that. The spirits say on Ouija boards that they like me and Iaposm like a mother to them.  The group uses a range of ghost hunting equipment during its visits to haunted places, including cameras, night vision equipment, dowsing rods and Ouija boards. It also uses white sage to purge an area of any malevolent spirits at the end of a visit.Beth set up Spirit Walkers four months ago and the group already has  Facebook followers.She added: Some teams claim every piece of footage they get is paranormal but weaposre not like that.

victory over Hearts has been dampened by the - aggregate loss to Rijeka and - league loss at St Mirren.McInnes’ side struggled to an extra-time Betfred Cup win over second-tier Dundee on Sunday, and Hedges insists they can no longer hide behind excuses like fatigue as they try to rediscover the dynamic, free-flowing football they showed just a few weeks ago.Hedges said: “We were off Monday and Tuesday, so we’ve had a few days.“I think the performancewasn’t to the standard we expect, but the main thing is we’re through and now we’ve got to look forward to the next round in the League Cup and to today.“When the games come thick and fast, there’s a lot of things to overcome and the travelling out to Croatia probably didn’t help as well.“But you want to be playing Thursday and Sunday, because it means you’re still in Europe, obviously that’s not the case anymore, but playing with  men on Thursday probably didn’t help going into Sunday.“I don’t think we can hide behind that – we should’ve done a lot better and hopefully we can put it right today.“On the whole, everyone to a man could’ve given a better performance.“I can’t say there were any stand-out performances.“Cossyis scoring goals, but there’s a lot more the team can give as a whole and hopefully we can do that.”Today was set to be a novelty for Hedges as he’d never played competitive football on an articial pitch.Angelo Alessio’s Kilmarnock, who will also be new to him, have a newly-laid G surface at Rugby Park.Hedges said: “I’ve never been to Kilmarnock and it’ll be a whole new experience playing on G as well.“It’s one I’m looking forward to and something I’ll need to get used to playing in this league.”He added: “They’ve got a new manager in who’s trying to change the way they play this season.“We know it’s going to be a hard game, but we need to go there trying to get three points.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/iStock-964395046-126x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"aberdeen art trust calls for new artists","story":"Creative members of the public are being given the opportunity to answer an exhibition’s open call.Grampian Hospitals Art Trusthas partnered with NHS Grampian for the initiative, which will see artwork showcased in the Suttie Arts Space at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary from November  until January .A statement by the charity said: “GHAT aim to showcase a wide range of artworks, including painting, drawing, sculpture, print, film and photography.“Using a medium of your choice, the content and theme should be suitable for family and NHSG audiences.”Selected artists will be invited to a preview event before the opening of the exhibition on November .For more information on how to apply, the application pack can be downloaded at bit.ly YQxEl"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/5d5fd225da82c8.70592606-351x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet dougal josie and harley are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This boisterous boy is five years old and is looking for a new place to call home.Dougal, who has been neutered, is not suitable to be homed around children.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"trailer load of cash raised for marie curie","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOne lucky winner can look forward to a cosy winter after winning a trailer load of logs at Mid Argyll Show.The sticks were donated, as in previous years, by Ardrishaig#s Alan Ryan to the Mid Argyll Marie Curie Fundraising Group for their stand at the show.

Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year.

This is standard, legal practice. Safety is our number one priority when arranging home to school transport.The spokesperson added: ldquoWe are working with colleagues across the council and in schools to ensure that all pupils who have been issued with a bus pass are on the transport providersrsquo lists and to improve access to the school transport timetables.ldquoWe recognise that this may have caused uncertainty for parents, carers and pupils.ldquoOur staff and the transport providers will continue to work closely together to manage the transition to these new arrangements.Councillor Craig Hoy, ward member, said: ldquoI was relieved to get clear reassurance from council staff on the issues of vehicle safety and the safety of children travelling from Gford and outlying areas to Knox Academy.ldquoItrsquos clear that there were communications problems which impacted parents and pupils.

For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays.

She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really

effectiveness.George Robertson, from the townrsquos community council, stressed the consultation needed to be ldquothorough.He said: ldquoThe feedback has been very mixed some are in favour and quite a few are opposed.ldquoI think where we are at the moment is we have already talked as part of the community council to East Lothian Council to convince them that they need to do a comprehensive survey of local opinion in order to determine the way ahead.The townrsquos community council has been heavily involved in discussions surrounding the reduced speed limit in the town.Mr Robertson said original discussions looked at the speed limit on residential streets, such as Countess Road, being reduced to mph.At that time, the plan was for the greater speed limit ndash mph ndash to remain in place on, at least, sections of the main arterial routes, such as Belhaven Road, but they had their speed limit lowered too.Fellow community councillor Herbert Coutts has been firmly behind the calls for the reduced speed limit.He said: ldquoMy feeling is that the speed trial has been a useful exercise and that a considerable number of people have been law abiding and have observed the mph speed

would be preferred ndash space is also available to make suggestions of both removing streets or indeed adding streets.There is also the opportunity to add comments regarding speed limits in Hallhill, south of the railway line, which also has a near-blanket mph limit which is already permanent.Responses can be submitted online, while , leaflets will be posted through the doors of homes in Dunbar

years. While the name of these types of promotions seems to imply that players will be on the receiving end of totally free spins, during which anything won can be kept and withdrawn, the truth is often a bit murkier than that.The UK Gambling Commission has played no small role in attempting to clear up the matter. According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached. They should be offered to players with a genuine chance to win real money for free, money which can ndasha player desires ndash be withdrawn from the start. This doesnrsquot mean to say that there arenrsquot other terms and conditions.Many top free spin bonuses tend to come with dates attached, only being valid during a predetermined period. Moreover, they may only be valid on select slot machines and could be limited to players in a specic region.Only a Handful of Chances to WinThere is a downside to the new ldquofree spins offers at casinos. They generally tend to provide a limited number of spins, far fewer than the old no deposit bonuses with wagering requirements, and deposit offers. Moreover, they are often only valid on slot games which do not offer substantial cash prizes, including many simple - line games from NetEnt and others.Promos Which Are Ideal for Test Driving CasinosSuch free spin bonuses which come with no wagering requirements at all are hardly going to be appealing for players who fancy landing big wins. As mentioned, they tend to be valid on slots which donrsquot offer such epic wins. However, these promos and deals may make the ideal introduction to slot gaming for new players, or those who wish to test-drive a slot before deciding to wager real money on it.The East Lothian Courierencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Labour   s tortuous EU twist won   t halt a No Deal Brexit","story":"Europhiles in the Labour Party can hardly believe it. After three years trying to explain to bemused voters why Labour is backing Brexittheyrsquore now free to say what they always wanted: Labour is the party of Remain. Itrsquos out of the closet.Twitter trolls have been sent packing. The high priestess of Remain, the rsquos Polly Toynbee, has given her blessing. The hyperactive Labour peer, Lord Adonis, and the #FBPE philosopher, SC Grayling, are singing a duet of ldquoOh! Jeremy Corbyn. Tony Blair has been stunned into silence.However, long-standing Labour Remainers are just a little cautious about this conversion on the road to departure. And with cause. Mr Corbyn remains enigmatic, as always. It is not at all clear the Labour leader is personally planning to back Remain.:Bill for Citizens Assembly consultants nears pound,Moreover, Labour Party policy is still pro-Brexit. Its manesto commits a Labour government to accepting the results of the  referendum and leaving the European Union, ending free movement along the way. A General Election is possibly weeks away, yet an incoming Labour government is committed to negotiating a ldquobetter Brexit deal with Brussels.The new twist is that this new deal would be put to the voters of Britain in a ldquoconfirmatory referendum. But there is no presumption that Labour would campaign in favour of it. Indeed, leading figures like Ms Abbott and Mr McDonnell would clearly call for voters to reject Labourrsquos new deal.Letrsquos work this through: Prime Minister Corbynrsquos first act would be to approach Brussels for renegotiation of the Withdrawal Agreement. This would presumably include the things they wanted to tag on to Theresa Mayrsquos deal: Customs Union, regulatory alignment with the single market, job and environmental protections and so on.Now, there is every reason to suppose that Brussels would accept this new deal with alacrity, since it is very largely the arrangement it has with countries like Norway and Switzerland.

And wersquore not giving the referendum question because that would be ldquospeculative.Some in the Labour Party still believe that the ldquoconfirmatory ballot could be Deal versus Remain, excluding any No Deal Brexit. But this would surely be a non-starter. The Electoral Commission would say that such gerrymandering of the franchise excludes too many voters. According to YouGov, more voters are in favour of No Deal Brexit than are in favour of Mr Corbyn becoming Prime Minister.The last time Labour got into a mess like this was over the Scottish referendum back in . Tony Blair did a U-turn on devolution announcing that,the Scottish Parliament was really the ldquosettled will of the Scottish people, as the late John Smith believed, then it should be tested in a referendum. The wrangling went on for months. The hapless Shadow Scottish Secretary, George Robertson, was left trying to explain why there would be one, two or possibly three referendums before the settled will could be determined.:Irsquom a Yes voter, but Irsquom now sick and tired of my own sideHowever, that constitutional imbroglio was nothing compared to Brexit. Scottish home rule was never going to determine the outcome of the  General Election because it was of marginal interest to the vast majority of UK voters. Brexit is the central question that will dominate the coming General Election, and probably the ones after it. Parliament has proved unable to address the question properly, let alone find a satisfactory resolution.If Labour had really intended to pivot to Remain it should have done it two years ago when Parliament debated Article . That legislation made Brexit legally binding, and a No Deal Brexit the default. It was the height of irresponsibility for MPs, led by Mr Corbyn, to vote by a massive  majority to authorise Brexit, on a hard timetable, irrespective of the terms of departure. It was, as the SNP argued, a Brexit blank cheque.Mr Corbyn now says he will do ldquowhatever it takes to stop No Deal Brexit. But this is like waiting till the bus is tipping over the clf before trying to do a handbrake turn. Labour could belatedly have prevented a deal-less departure from the EU by supporting Mrs Mayrsquos Withdrawal Agreement, most of which Labour actually agreed with. It chose instead to walk through the ision lobbies with the far-right European Research Group of Tory MPs.Indeed, Labour could have halted hard Brexit on a number of occasions. It refused to endorse a Norway option, Mrs Mayrsquos deal, or a compromise in the last-minute negotiations with the Government. Mr Corbyn chose to dance around the question, seeking a narrow party advantage. It was all tactics and no strategy and played into the hands of one Boris Johnson.My own view is that Mr Corbyn would be rather content now to see a hard Brexit. This is partly because he has always been a Eurosceptic, but mainly because he thinks Labour could capitalise on the chaos thereafter. When your opponents are making a mess of things, donrsquot get in the way.Itrsquos an electoral gambit, but a cynical one and voters may not go along with it.

The fewer the votes in play, the bigger the scope for an upset.:Scotland in Union funds sink to record lowOrkney MP Alistair Carmichael this week sounded the alarm, urging Labour and Tory supporters to back the LibDems. ldquoIf we split the anti-independence vote by voting for other parties or independents, then it is possible the SNP could win this seat, he said.ldquoThere is a reason why, having not set foot in Shetland for three years, the First Minister has now visited three times in one month.Of course, scare tactics to mobilise your vote are standard for elections. But other LibDems say similar things in private. ldquoItrsquoll be close, they frown.There is another factor that can help the SNP. Money. At national elections, candidate spending limits are based on the size of the electorate. In Shetland, the maximum allowed by law in  was pound, over five months. But the spending limit in byelections is a standard pound, that can be spent in five weeks.That kind of money - which the SNP has and the Scottish LibDems donrsquot - lets the SNP blitz every corner of the islands.Motivation is also with the SNP.

The firm has enlisted the services of Matthew Black, previously a senior energy adviser at the Stirlingshire-based Fintry Development Trust, specialising in reducing carbon emissions and enhancing sustainability.Mr Black said: ldquoShared ground loop arrays are the most effective solution for delivering Scotlandrsquos ambitions for the decarbonisation of heat. Along with the right policy changes in Scotland, we can make signicant progress towards Scotlandrsquos  net-zero carbon target and beyond.ldquoThe race to decarbonise electricity in Scotland has made considerable progress. The race to decarbonise heat and transport is on.Currently celebrating its th anniversary, Kensarsquos heat pumps already provide heating to a number of sites, notably Orkney Islands Councilrsquos multipurpose facility Stromness Warehouse, which is heated using the sea, and the first and most northerly ground source installations in Unst, Shetlands.The Warehouse Buildings house the townrsquos library and customer services team, and provide a work base for staff from a iety of Council services, and draw heat from coils of pipes fixed to  stainless steel s ndash known as ldquopond-mats ndash sunk beneath a nearby pier to draw heat from the surrounding water.This has allowed the local authority to make substantial savings, thanks to the pound, cost of the electricity used to run the xkW heat pump over a -month period, compared to pound, for an oil-based system.It also means the Warehouse Buildings now produce substantially less greenhouse gas emissions thana more conventional source of heat was used.The carbon emissions linked to keeping the Warehouse Buildings warm are calculated to be six tonnes of CO per year, compared to more than  tonnesan oil boiler had been fitted.James Stockan, who chairs the councilrsquos Development and Infrastructure Committee, said at the time: ldquoAcross the country very few buildings currently use sea-source heating systems. ldquoAs the Warehouse Buildings stand close to the sea, it made sense to opt for this innovative approach to keeping them warm and I am very pleased the system is proving to be efficient and effective.ldquoAs wersquore using heat from the sea and electricity primarily from renewables, these buildings are an excellent example of how the council is making signicant steps towards creating buildings that are virtually carbon neutral in terms of their energy consumption.ldquoThis investment clearly demonstrates our commitment to making best use of one of Orkneyrsquos greatest assets ndash the abundant renewable energy we can harness from the wind and seas around us."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-government-worker-simon-cheng-freed-china","story":"A spokeswoman at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed the release in a statement to the PA news agency.She said: ldquoWe welcome the release of Simon Cheng and are delighted that he can be reunited with his family.ldquoWe will continue to provide support to them.:Foreign Office lsquourgentlyrsquo seeking more information about detained embassy workerldquoSimon and his family have requested privacy and we would be gratefulthis is respected.Public security authorities in Shenzhen said Mr Cheng was released as scheduled after  days of administrative detention.The Luohu public security bureau in Shenzhen, the mainland city neighbouring Hong Kong, made the announcement on its Weibo microblog account.Mr Cheng was detained for violating mainland Chinese law and ldquoconfessed to his illegal acts, the statement said, without providing further details.ldquoSimon is released.

By building a further  million turbines, the entire world could be powered until .With Scotlands current greenhouse gas emissions target set to meet net-zero in , windfarms are said to be a key tool in reaching the goal. Butthe building and maintenance of these windfarms and their de- or recommission  years later destroys one of our greatest natural assets in the flight against climate breakdown, as well as others, what are their true cost Richard Lindsay, head of environmental and conservation research the University of East London said: \"There is a delicious irony in the fact that we build wind farms to reduce our carbon emissions. But some of the best places to build wind farms are peatlands, which are our biggest carbon store.\"Just cm of peat over a hectare holds the same amount of carbon as the same area of tropical rainforest. They have been capturing and storing carbon for up to  years so when you damage them, you release this long-term carbon store.\"Read more: The green energy debate: why wind power will never be the answerPeat is lost when the foundations for the turbines are dug out but it is the building of the roads that are the biggest risk to the peatlands, said Mr Lindsay, as they cut across their natural water s, causing them to dry out.Mr Lindsay said: \"As soon as you stop peat being water logged it will begin releasing carbon dioxide. Long term, we actually dont know what the effect is going to be.\"Other concerns, particularly in Shetland, include peat slides which occur after the peat has been destabilised through disturbance. In , in Galway, around km of peat slid off the hillside and travelled for km down the river system narrowly missing buildings.Mr Lindsay said: \"Actually, they are just slowly sinking roads.What they need to be doing is constantly building the road surface up again. The windfarm industry is not been very forthcoming on the extent of that issue.\"In terms of what is being done by energy companies to offset damage to the peat, the future remains unclear. Mr Lindsay said: \"Maybe theyre restoring some very damaged peatland but what are the long term effects of what theyre doing on the windfarm  Nobody can answer that question because were looking at potential carbon release over decades. There are a whole series of issues that have never really been investigated.\"And its not just an issue in Scotland. On the ridges of Northern Spains Cantabrian Mountains windfarms have been constructed on blanket bog, bisecting almost every one.But there could be an alternative: building onshore windfarms on agricultural land that is currently not being used to its full potential.In America and Europe, some windfarms are built on leased farmland, allowing farming, crops and grazing, to continue around them.Mr Lindsay said: \"There is incredible reluctance to turn agricultural land into multi-use but there is huge potential there.\"Scottish government planning policy now requires the use of a carbon payback calculator, developed by The James Hutton Institute and Aberdeen University, that assesses the carbon impact of windfarm developments by comparing the carbon costs of the developments with the carbon savings made.David Miller, Knowledge Exchange Coordinator for The James Hutton Institute who helped develop the calculator, told the Herald on Sunday: \"The starting point was to rely on modelling of the carbon costs ... after a few years you could begin to refine the models to say the carbon payback would take a certain number of years, originally calculated to be one estimate and then subsequently recalculated today.\"Calculations can y from seven to  years which far exceeds the -year le span of turbines, influencing the carbon calculations when considering the impact of re-turbining or reinstatement of the site.Mr Miller said: \"This is something still being worked on in Scotland because we recognise that protecting our peatland is a core element of Scotlands contribution to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.\"Onshore wind is playing its part meeting Scotlands climate targets, said Mr Miller, but more questions need to be asked.He said: \"After  years, as each of the developments come up for reconsideration, are there any which might have been put in the wrong place and might not be renewed because other sources [of energy] are becoming effective.\"We have an opportunity in the second half of the next decade for reconsidering whether some of the earlier developments are as efficient for production as originally intended. Hypothetically, it might turn out [that windfarms] are not as negatively impacting to landscapes as feared or there might be other areas where the impacts are greater than has been expected but it does mean that the story is not finished.\"Nothing comes without a cost, said Mr Miller, especially not our energyHe said: \"Energy isnt created, its just transferred. So its hard to imagine that genuinely, there is environmental and cost free energy. Its not just the magnitude but where and the nature of the trade-off. That explains why were felling trees instead of planting them as we did  years ago because of the understanding of the signicance of the peatlands for carbon storage.\""},{"url":null,"title":"green-energy-debate-case-onshore-wind","story":"As our capacity to capture the energy from the gales and breezes which scour Europes windiest country has increased, so too have the numerous benefits which onshore wind farms bring.In , the most recent year for which statistics are available, the onshore wind sector invested pound. billion in Scotland ndash the equivalent of .% of Scotlandrsquos GDP.Read more:The green energy debate: are wind farms really worth it But the real reason the world needs onshore wind is simple: we cannot win the fight against climate changeour energy industry continues to produce carbon at the rate it historically has.The equivalent of around three quarters of the electricity we use in Scotland is delivered by renewables like onshore wind today, up from just a quarter  years ago.Using renewables like onshore wind to generate electricity means we dont have to use fossil fuels, and prevents, according to the most recent figures, . million tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere each year ndash the equivalent of taking almost every car, bus, lorry and train off Scotlandrsquos roads and rails.But while onshore wind power is more popular today than itrsquos ever been ndash and more popular in Scotland than in the rest of the UK ndash we need to be sure the development of onshore wind projects is as environmentally sound as it can be.Industry works hard with an enormous range of stakeholders to make sure that the very best construction, operations and maintenance practices are followed.Last monthwe worked with our members, Perth and Kinross Council, Historic Environment Scotland, Forestry Commission Scotland, SEPA and Marine Scotland to update a document which has come to symbolise that cooperation: Good Practice during Wind Farm Construction.Read more: The green energy debate: why wind power will never be the answerIt sets out, in detail, best-practice principles on every aspect of wind farm construction, from how to best engage planning authorities as a site is being considered right through to engaging in circular economy concepts like re-using and recovering as much redundant material as possible.Scottish Renewables also sits on Scotlandrsquos National Peatland Group, which is revising a National Peatland Plan to take into account new information on how wind farms and peatland interact.And that brings us to a remarkable but often hidden benefit of onshore wind development: its intrinsic relationship with conservation and restoration of our most valued flora, fauna and landscapes.The Scottish Governmentrsquos carbon calculator plays a key role in ensuring that wind farm developments in Scotland are built in a sustainable way.It compares the carbon costs of wind farm developments with the carbon savings attributable to the wind farm in a comprehensive and consistent way, giving planners the detail they need to consider every application.As an industry which works in remote areasthe onshore wind sector has led the way in restoring hectares of degraded peatland while at the same time installing turbines to tackle climate change and generate local economic benefit.Scotlands rigorous planning system, currently undergoing reform following the PlanningAct and through the formulation of the fourth National Planning Framework, is in place to ensure only good, sustainable projects get built ndash and that all interested parties get their say in the process.We must continue to develop our renewable energy resource to provide the clean energy needed to tackle the climate emergency and meet our net-zero emissions target, and our industry will continue to work with stakeholders across society to make sure we do that in the most sustainable way possible."},{"url":null,"title":"following-money-trail-top-heavy-navy-passing-danish-britain-vietnam","story":"I know almost nothing about Greenland but it is clearly much more than the President of the United States.

Throughout the war the Allies had armed and supplied the independence movement, the Viet Minh under Ho Chi Minh, to fight the Japanese occupying forces on the promise of self-determination after hostilities.However, at the Potsdam Conference in July , when the world was ided into spheres of influence and control by Churchill, Stalin and Truman, it was decided that the French, who had colonised Vietnam, were to , although, after their defeat and occupation by the Nazis, they were in no shape to do so.The Germans had surrendered and after the two atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki the Japanese did likewise in early September.So Mountbatten, trying to hold the country for the Frenchand with insufficient Anglo-Indian troops to do so after Ho and the Viet Minh rebelled over the duplicity, allowed the Japanese armies to hold on to their weapons and fight against those who had been promised their freedom.Itrsquos a little-known and deeply shameful episode in Britainrsquos inglorious past.But for the arming of the then enemy, itrsquos safe to say there would have been no Dien Bien Phu, no Vietnam War, , US soldiers would not have died and, more pertinently, more than a million North Vietnamese soldiers and two million civilians would not have perished.This was an episode missing from the hagiographic documentary."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-39-s-greatest-views-part-2","story":"The second part of our fanastic series, Herald writers reveal their favourite views ... and explain why they should be yours too.Down Gleann an Dubh-Lochain, KnoydartWhat makes it so special  Wild, remote, astounding beauty.Its was late May, , and my friend and I had walked in from Kinlochhourn to the wild Knoydart peninsula .

Fay Vass, the society’s chief executive, said: “We frequently get calls from members of the public who have been watching a hedgehog that’s been lay still in their garden for days.“By the time we get the call and the person gets the hedgehog to rescue, it’s often too late.“Hedgehogs don’t sunbathe. If you see a hedgehog lay still in the open, or with flies round it orit’s struggling to walk properly, it is in urgent need of rescue.”If you find a hedgehog in need of help the society suggest you use gardening gloves or an old towel to collect the animal, placing it inside a high sided cardboard or plastic box with the towel or an old t-shirt in the bottom for it to hide under. Take the box indoors away from flies.If the hedgehog isn’t bleeding, offering a warm wrapped hot water bottle is good first aid, but do make sure there is room for it to get offit gets too warm and ensure the bottle is not allowed to go cold.Offer some meaty cat or dog food and water but don’t force feed it.Once you’ve done that, call a local hedgehog rescue centreyou know of one, or BHPS on    for further advice and local contacts.If it’s a baby, Fay says you should check for siblings.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The exhibition-on-wheels is travelling around Scotland highlighting the importance of remembrance.\"  Poppyscotland’s ‘Bud’ hits the road to tell the poppy’s storyviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A healthier way to travel...and the government hopes more of us will get back on our bikes or walk for short journeys, rather than taking the car.\"  Have your say on Scotland’s National Transport Strategy viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“Hoglets don’t usually come in ones,” she said. “If a hoglet it is trouble, its brothers and sisters may well need help too, so do look around vicinity for others.” She added: “Acting quickly could literally mean the dference between le and death.

The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said armed forces personnel make huge sacrices to keep us all safe\"  Aberdeenshire Council achieves gold award for work with armed forces, families, veterans and cadets viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August ,  at : amCOMPETITION: WIN A PAIR OF TWEED LAMPSHADES FROM ORKNEY TWEED  The Orcadian has teamed up with Orkney Tweed to offer readers the chance to win a pair of Orkney Tweed lampshades, worth £.

Free parking of up to one hour will apply as usual in metered car parks over the winter period.Tankerness Lane will be closed to vehicles throughout the works, with one-way systems in place at ious times on Broad Street and Palace Road — with Victoria Street closed to vehicles for approximately five weeks from  January . Pedestrian access will be maintained throughout.The council has said the key aspects of the Place and Spaces project are to improve the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, provide a new path to the war memorial to enhance it as a place to stop and reflect on the signicance of the monument and improve the head of Victoria Street to encourage more people into this part of the town.Depute council leader, councillor Leslie Manson, said: “The works carried out in Kirkwall’s town centre through our Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme have given our streets and buildings a much-needed new lease of le, whether that be improvements to the shop fronts or the attractive new paving at the head of Broad Street.“This latest phase is aimed at improving the entrance to Victoria Street to encourage more shoppers and visitors to take a wander down this street — a long-held aspiration of the businesses that are situated there.“There will, of course, be some inevitable disruption, but we’ve worked hard to ensure that this is kept to a minimum, including suspending works for the Christmas period. I look forward to seeing the improvements that are made and the effect these have on our historic streets.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As Channel  head of news and current affairs, and newly-crowned Queen of the Sisterhood, Dorothy Byrne, picked up a sling-shot and hit a succession of media Goliaths, including James Murdoch, squarely between the eyes, a squad of broadcast and print journalists appeared to have embarked on a mission to demonstrate the acuity of her take-down and the urgency of her message.Where to start  On Radio , where John Humphrys and David Davis were chortling like schoolboys over an act of domestic violence  Or on C, where a new reality TV show starring Scarlett Moffatt is gearing up to exploit a Namibian tribe while ostensibly exploring a clash of cultures Maybe we should take a look at the front page of the Daily Mail where an equivalence was being drawn between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s trip in Elton John’s private plane and Prince Andrew’s long-standing friendship with the late child sex trafficker, Jeffrey Epstein  Or other headlines on websites which suggested a -year-old “was forced to lose her virginity” to the former multi-millionaire. Christ, how many times  IT’S RAPE, you troglodytes.However discomfiting these examples may be, they have nothing on the disingenuous coverage of Boris Johnson’s encounters with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. I mean, we could all see him sitting beside Merkel as protesters screamed “Liar” and “Stop Brexit” we could all see him stick his feet up on Macron’s side table like a self-entitled brat .The most inexperienced of analysts would have understood that turning up in Berlin with bluster and braggadocio, but no actual plan B was hardly a masterstroke and that Merkel and Macron’s agreement to give him a month to come up with aalternative was just a tactic to keep him occupied while they get on with important affairs of state.And yet the Express and the– cheerleaders for the worst Prime Minister in history – presented his bilateral talks as a triumph. The Express carried a photo of him raising his arms behind a fence with the headline “Brexit Victory Salute”, ashe were Winston Churchill giving his “Finest Hour” speech rather than a floppy-haired fop back from a European jolly. Thewent with the headline “Johnson Demands Fresh Border Plan”while columnists lined up to explain how he had seen off Macron’s attempts to intimidate him and had reset the EU negotiations. Neither paper pointed out that Macron reiterated that the Irish backstop was “indispensable” and that this is the position they have held ever since Theresa May’s withdrawal deal was negotiated.Their spin – or as Byrne would doubtless prefer us to frame it, “lie” – would be troubling at the best of times but as we are hurtling towards a No Deal, it is utterly irresponsible. At a time when journalists should be pointing out the perils of his misplaced ebullience, many are egging him on, feeding his self-delusion.In her MacTaggart Lecture, Byrne called out the inadequacy of much of our current news coverage and scrutinised some of the reasons for it. She blamed our contemporary leaders – May, Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn – for refusing to submit themselves to scrutiny as previous leaders including Margaret Thatcher did, and went on to compare the way Johnson does his own pieces to camera as Vladimir Putin-style politics.But she also castigated news organisations for believing audiences no longer crave forensic investigations and for talking down to young people. Citing Carole Cadwalladr’s Facebook Cambridge Analytica investigation and the popularity of hard-hitting podcasts, she said there was still an appetite for in-depth exposés, although she didn’t point out that they require resources as well as courage – and that such resources are not widely available.Finally, Byrne talked fearlessly about the need for more ersity: for more women, certainly but much more pressingly for more BAME employees. Although she rejected the phrase “pale, male and stale”, pointing out that many middle-aged white men make excellent programmes, she said TV made by a clique of posh boys was never going to challenge the status quo. “When you change who is making TV, you change TV,” she said.Much of what Byrne raised, we see in action every day the cabal of male presenters who revel in their outmoded attitudes . And the courting of a younger demographic with nattily-dressed presenters, bite-sized news items and YouTube influencers when what many of those who are politically engaged want is to be confronted with new perspectives on giant issues such as climate change. There are exceptions, of course: Jon Snow stands out as a journalist willing to challenge the prevailing orthodoxy, and Five Live journalist Emma Barnett has earned a reputation for skewering political interviewees.But time and time again, especially in  shows and radio phone-ins, broadcasters yield to the demand of  balance, treating journalism as a stand-off between two opposing sides rather than a quest for truth. Nor is BBC Scotland immune to these problems though much of the new channel’s output has been admirable, it is still overwhelmingly white. Meanwhile, The Nine has twice invited alt-right mouthpiece Brendan O’Neill to spout his anti-scientic climate change-denying views. Shouldn’t we be better than this As the spectre of a no-deal Brexit casts its increasingly dark shadow, there does appear to be a collective raising of the game. Over the past week or so, the BBC has been running a series of news packages analysing what a no-deal Brexit might mean in terms of the supply of fuel and medicine and the slaughter of animals that can no longer be exported.But as Byrne says, whatever happens with Brexit, our country is undergoing seismic changes and our broadcasters must do much morethey are to play a crucial role in holding those responsible to account. “We must find courage in this time of crisis,” the Scot said. “We must unite to use the power of television to protect democracy because it is being seriously undermined.” The following day, the Express gave its default response, which was to refer to “an online backlash” invisible to all but them.As Johnson engages in some pre-US trade talk willy-waving – insisting he will tell the US president “the NHS is not on the table” – Byrne’s rallying cry could not be more relevant. As men who couldn’t be trusted to tie their own shoelaces set the global agenda, the public is being failed. We need journalists to be less cowed. But we also need broadcasting companies to be willing to take risks, and newspaper owners to be interested in the actual news. And we need this to happen sooner rather than later.

But we need to know what we want from independence. That’s the conversation I want to be having.“We can all see what went wrong with Brexit. No-one had any vision for what a post-Brexit UK would look like.

We want to move away from oil and gas. “It is important to have more than one vision of what an independent Scotland can look like. “It’s unhealthy for the SNP to think they own independence.

Scotland has  per cent of uk renewable energy  per cent of fish landings.  per cent of fresh water supplies  per cent of crude oil production  per cent of uk natural gas production..Its no wonder they don#t want rid Scotland.The Scottish Government has an annual borrowing limit of £.bn, legally set by under the Scotland Act It#s not possible to have a #deficit# of £bn when the legal limit is £bn.The GERS figures are little more than fantasy, including for example £.bn of military expenditure that the UK government allocates to the Scottish budget.

We are also the only party to respect the result of the  referendum vote to leave the EU and the  referendum result to stay part of the UK.#Perhaps Mr Brydon Goodlad could show how the UK is standing up for our fishing industry by publicising how many foreign boats will be removed from UK waters and how much additional quota will be available to UK fishermen as a result of these three agreements.If the Tories had their waythe sea#s would be sucked dry of any fish, and they would, probably, invite the USA to fish the waters as well, since we all know just how much the Tories love anything to do with the USA##.and privatization.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats. The former was cleaned out last week after contaminants were discovered inside the base of the stack, said Mr Jonermark, and the amount of bacteria used to pury the air in a filter chamber has been increased. Highland Council would be approached to seethey would agree to a -metre extension to the height of the chimney.As far as the feed boats are concerned, Mr Nilsson said the problem arises when the hatches are opened so that the fish meal can be delivered to the plant.

We do not want this situation to continue.#We want to make a positive contribution to the village and we will continue to invest to make sure the problems go away.

excellent results in both their AS and A courses.“I particularly congratulate Year  students Lauren Roy and Clodagh Slattery, both of whom took four A Levels and both of whom have achieved outstanding results across their subjects.He also thanked his staff for the support they have given the school’s young people.: Daria Gapska, Jason Givens, Ciara Johnston back: Dawid Piwowarski, Leon Spurgeon,

The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.Cullybackey patient Thelma Shanks from Cullybackey was referred onto the programme this year. She said: “There is a history of hypertension and diabetes in my family. “Several of my paternal aunts sadly passed away due to complications that came with the disease, and my mum was found to be diabetic following admission to hospital for routine tests. “I was born in London, but grew up in my parent country, Jamaica. I ed to the UK for good in , and my husband and I moved to Northern Ireland, where all my children were born, in . “As a nation, we from the Caribbean tend to be a bit more susceptible to diabetes than others, so it wasn’t a complete surprise to be told I was at risk of developing the disease. “I am also a trained doctor so despite having given up my profession when I had children, I have knowledge of the medical risk.“I have a wonderful busy family le. I have four children, all of which I home schooled, and of course, their needs always came before mine. “When you’re running a busy house and looking after everyone  it’s easy to forget to look after yourself. However, in  when I heard that a health fair was coming to the area I decided to go along. For a small fee they carried out multiple tests which showed I had hypertension or high blood pressure. “I decided to make an appointment with my GP who put me on a number of drugs, first Irbesartan, then Amlodipine and finally a diuretic to bring my blood pressure under control.“I realised I needed to be more careful with my diet and tried to be a bit healthier but I admit it was a bit half-hearted. TESTS“My blood sugar levels were border-line they weren’t going down but they weren’t going up either, so I thought everything was all right. I was having routine check-ups with my nurse at this stage so I was on her radar and having blood tests taken intermittently. In April  I had my regular tests done and then hopped on a plane to London. “It was my daughter’s birthday and I had decided to treat her by going away for the week. We had just made it to the hotel when I received a phone call from my nurse. “She said tests showed my sugar levels were up and I was actually diabetic, which was the wake-up call I needed. Let’s just say it wasn’t quite the luxury week that I had planned! My daughter certainly ate well, but no sugar passed my lips that trip. “Needless to say, I had the blood tests repeated soon after our , and was delighted to learn that due to my dietary sacrices, my blood sugar levels had again receded into the ‘pre-diabetic’ band.“Prior to our trip away, my doctor had called me. She said there was a new Diabetes Prevention Programme starting soon in my area being run by the Public Health Agency. She askedI would be interested and of course I agreed.“The class has  others in it and we meet on Wednesday afternoons. There are eight women and two men, and together we re-learn what we should be eating, what to avoid, and how to step up our exercise routines. “I’ve found it really helpful because everyone is in the same boat and we can share our experiences and encourage one another. “Each week we build on the goals of the previous weeks, paying attention to diet and exercise and gaining strength from each other.“I used to believe that running after a busy family was exercise enough but now I’m walking every other day, trying to increase my pace and my distance. My daughter and I often walk together and I try to keep up with her. LONG TERM“One day I managed , steps in one walk and  of those miles were uphill. I’m trying to make long term changes and make sure these become habits I’ll stick to for the rest of my le. So far I’ve lost  kg, and my exercise levels have increased signicantly too. My blood sugar levels have decreased, but more importantly I feel better physically and psychologically. “The Diabetes Prevention Programme and the team who deliver it have been amazing. I’m looking forward to seeing a new me at the end of the nine and a half month course.”Thelma was referred onto the Diabetes Prevention Programme by her GP Dr Jean McCaughern, Maine Medical Practice, CullybackeyThe practice serves around , patients that live within a six mile radius of the surgery. Dr Jean McCaughern joined the surgery around  years ago and was placed in charge of the practice’s diabetes clinic.At first she managed this alone, today she heads up this specialist clinic with the help of two practice nurses. She does this alongside her normal GP responsibilities.She said: “When I first started the clinic around % of our patients were diabetic and that included those who had both type  and type  diabetes. Today that figure has more than doubled. In  we have a prevalence rate of .%. That’s how quickly the disease is on the rise. “Often patients don’t realise just how serious the illness is. I have overheard patients saying ‘I just have a touch of diabetes’ or ‘I only have diabetes’, but it’s a serious illness which can cause deterioration of vision, contribute to heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and vascular problems which at their worst can lead to amputation.“Patients of mine have had all these problems and more. The reality is dferent to the perception and it’s only when dficulties start that people begin to understand what living with diabetes can mean. The longer you have the disease, the more likely you are to have any one of those complications.“Having diabetes presents practical problems too. In some cases the DVLA can revoke people’s drivers licensestheythey believe there is poor management of diabetes. This can include raised sugars, but more importantly sugar levels dropping and causing confusion in patients as is would be unsafe to drive.“For some people having diabetes is out of their control. Those with Type  diabetes have no choice but to manage it using medication. “For others who spot heightened blood sugar levels early, termed pre-diabetic, they have a window of opportunity to reverse or delay a diagnosis of Type  diabetes through healthy eating and exercise. That’s who the Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at and who it can help.“Once higher sugar levels are discovered, the earlier people can make changes and the higher the chance they have of reversing the outcome. Sometimes, it’s not about changing the diagnosis but delaying it by a decade or so. “The longer you can hold it off the longer you can hold off the complications that come with it. “It’s not all bad news though, having diabetes, whether Type  or Type , is largely manageable either by medication, treatment or diet. “Insulin, used primarily for treating type  diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels when diet and exercise alone aren’t sufficient, but the effectiveness of these medications depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and the size of the dose.“I was happy to get involved in the Programme. Having an interest in diabetes I was approached by the Public Health Agency at the operational stage to look at the programme’s viability in my area. I’m a big supporter. “So far I’ve referred around  people from the practice onto the programme which educates and empowers people of the contents of foods, the need to exercise and develop better eating patterns. “Often I’ve heard people say once they have to go on a special diabetes diet but that’s not the case, it’s just healthy eating, it’s the way we should all be eating.“As far as the success of the programme goes, it’s a little early to tell. The first cohort of people started on the programme in May and early results are positive. Certainly weight loss as a group has occurred and people have more knowledge of food, portion control and exercise.“So, there are benefits for all and for some the course is working really well. When you join the programme as a group you bond as a group, you encourage each other, you don’t want to let your group members down. “That shared experience and cohesiveness is a real motivator and works across all ages and all groups. For many the programme offers them a chance to turn a future diagnosis around and gives them the tools to change their future. “That can be le changing and what the programme is designed to do”.KEY FACTSThe Diabetes Prevention Programme is run by the Public Health Agency.It is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The Diabetes Prevention Programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge.It is facilitated by health coaches who offer help and assistance to participants, helping them change their lestyle, diet and physical activity with the aim of postponing and even preventing type  diabetes.For more information on the ‘Diabetes Prevention Programmeemail your local Health Trustdiabetespreventionni@northerntrust.hscni.netst  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094373.jpg--.jpg?1566376242000\n","title":"talent galore at music mania event","story":"Broughshane was alive with the sound of music last weekend when the Music Mania event rolled into the village.Local people were given the chance to take to the stage and show off their musical abilities and talents, both with instruments and voice.Many turned out to not only take part, but also to watch on and support those on stage.Bob Esler was the compare for the evening where there was live music on stage from pm with an open mic session and a BBQ proving popular with everyone.

Whether it’s further education or the world of employment, the important thing is not to panic. There are loads of options available and, as McDonald’s Westwood’s Business Manager Katie McManus can attest, an unexpected road can often be the best one.The -year-old began working in McDonald’s in Glengormley while studying for her A-levels. Aged , Katie had plans of going to University and becoming a Mental Health Nurse, but completely changed direction following her time at the fast food restaurant. “I decided not to go to university and to take a gap year after my exams,” she explained.“I went Crew Member to Sht Manager and then realised that’s what I wanted to do. I got promoted the whole way through to Business Manager. “Personally, I wouldn’t advise anyone to go to university until they know what they want to do. There’s no point wasting the time and money doing it. I would encourage people who are maybe panicking about grades not to worry. There are dferent things out there, and you’re not always taught that in school or given all the options. I never thought I would be working in McDonald’s but the option found me.”She continued: “It’s not what people would assume – it’s very business orientated for me. You’re very driven to work towards targets and it’s competitive. The teamwork and morale is amazing too, you literally feel like you’re with your family away from home.”As well as offering a career, McDonald’s also offers a range of educational and professional development courses to help employees attain everything from GCSE’s to university degree.“There are so many opportunities,” Katie said. “You can constantly get promoted towards Business Manager and then after that you have options to become a franchiser one day, which is a big opportunity butyou really want it you can push for it. “We have people at the minute studying for the GCSEs through our apprenticeship programmes, so they’re getting their Maths and English qualications, which will help them in the future le. Because I didn’t go to university, the option is there for me to do a business degree, which I’m planning on doing next year, so I didn’t miss out on that.”She continued: “I was quite anxious and nervous about making the decision not to go to university. It’s hard to knowyou’re making the right decision at that age. “Looking back, I’m glad it turned out that way. I would say to some of the young ones in here not to panic. Everything happens for a reason and you don’t know what path you’re going to go down until you go down it. GCSE’s and other exams are important, but there are other avenues that you can go down to get dferent jobs.”She added: “McDonald’s don’t really on experience and what you have in your qualications – it’s all about your attitude, your attitude to doing well and how hard you work. “If you are hard working and they really want to make something ofyourself then you should come here.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"glasmullin green standoff continues into second day","story":"PROTESTORS have ed to Glassmullin Green amid a stand off over plans by De La Salle College to build a new sports facility on the site.Work was due to begin the £.million project yesterday, but campaigners moved on to the green in a bid to block the development.Contractors Haffey Sports Grounds left the site yesterday following an intervention from the Friends of Glassmullin Open Green , who have campaigned to protect the space since .Residents resumed their protest this morning.Aithne Kerrigan from FOGOG has accused De La Salle College of acting “in bad faith from the outset”.“They have said that they have tried to engage with residents – they haven’t,” she said.“They held an open night at the start of April and they only managed to get seven people across their doors, four of which were definitely objectors. They told us at a meeting in April that they would keep us informed by email, but we have yet to receive an email from De La Salle to inform us that the work was going to start. They basically think we’re going to go away, but you know what  – we live here, we’re not going to go anywhere.”A spokesperson for De La Salle said the school had engaged in“considerable consultation” and modied plans three time to benefit its pupils and “the whole community”.“The school has kept the community in touch with developments as the contract process drew to a conclusion including leaflet drops and an open evening in April to present and view final design plans. A meeting with residents followed shortly after the open viewing evening. The school also indicated that with tendering administration nearly complete the work would start by the summer. Following notication from the successful contractor the school provided details to residents immediately about the contract start arrangements. We also advised local political representatives.”The spokesperson added: “The school has already invited residents to participate in a Management Committee to minimise the impact of any potential disruption to residents during the construction phase and to oversee the usage of the new facilities which will be available to the whole community next year. During the open viewing evening, at subsequent meetings and in written communications residents have been encouraged to join the Committee.“We remain committed to working with the local residents during the construction phase and thereafter.”FOGOG maintain that the pitch will be detrimental for the people of the area.“There’s going to be a major loss access to open green space,” Ms Kerrigan said.“There’s a covenant on this green. It should be protected for everybody. It shouldn’t be fenced off for exclusive use, not to mention noise pollution, lighting pollution, the additional traffic to this area, but fundamentally the loss of open green space. Glassmullin green is precious to the residents, it’s precious to the community.“We don’t have access to open green space in West Belfast. This is the last open green space in West Belfast and it should be protected for this generation and the next. We lost it before when it was Silver City, and we’re not prepared to lose it again.”She added: “We’ll do what needs to be done to protect Glassmullin Green. We’ve campaigned since  and we’re not going to stop now.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"portrait honour for campaigner raymond","story":"A PORTRAIT of a local victims campaigner has gone on display as part of an exhibition by an artist who believes he embodies the true spirit of the north.The painting of Raymond McCord is among  by artist Shauna Fox that have gone on display at the exhibition in the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street.Shaunawas born in Bangor but is now based in London, where she is studying fine art painting at Camberwell College of Arts. She makes paintings, sculptures and installations related to being a woman in st century Britain and, more recently, issues related to the north.Shaunw asked her father to pick someone for a portrait who he believes unites communities here. His answer was Newtownabbey man Raymond, who became well-known for his work as a victims campaigner after his son, Raymond Jnr, was murdered by the UVF in .Shauna explained: “Raymond McCord is a victims’ campaigner and he’s a man I’ve always admired – an archetypal Ulster man, brave, unrelenting and he believes that the only way we can deal with the past and move forward isboth communities deal with it together.“My work focuses a lot on ethical issues and human rights. I have explored the destruction of Aleppo by barrel bombs, the oppression of women in relation to honour and sacrice and the Troubles in Belfast.“I studied Ethics at school and from there I became interested in humanitarian and ethical issues. I knew my peers knew little of the atrocities, injustices and inhumanity being carried out at home and abroad on a daily basis and so I based my artwork around these issues in an attempt to raise awareness and present my thoughts, views and responses to them in an innovative and stimulating way.“This body of work is mainly based on my experience of living in Northern Ireland for  years, moving to London and then looking at it from afar. Moving away has made me interested in finding out more about where I’m from, but the more I discover about where I’m from, the more I question whether it’s somewhere I can be proud of and want to live in again.”Raymond said he was “honoured” to be featured in the exhibition.“It is an honour to have a portrait done. I never ever dreamt something like this would happen to me. Unbelievable. I can#t thank the artist enough.“The portrait itself will be dedicated to my son young Raymond and the rest of the innocent victims and in particular to the many from North Belfast. This is for all of us in both communities.”Shauna’s exhibition runs until August  at the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street."},{"url":null,"title":"alternative arrangements to brexit backstop can ensure no hard border insists dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We are continuing to work with the Government to reach a sensible deal as we exit the EU.\"It is time for the Irish Government to recognise the impact of no-deal on its access to the GB market and encourage the EU negotiators to take a more progressive and constructive approach in negotiations.\"She called on the Ulster Farmers Union to use its position on the all-Ireland Brexit forum to press Dublin to \"take a more reasonable approach\".Mr Aiken noted that the past week had seen \"a repeat of every single argument in favour of and against the backstop\".He said: \"I and other unionists oppose the backstop because it undermines the Belfast Agreement and bypasses the principle of consent. Others within nationalism have a dferent view.\"The bottom line is that as long as this stand-off continues, we edge closer to a no-deal Brexit.\"There is only one way to solve this and thats to get into negotiations behind closed doors.\"Sinn Fein yesterday insisted there was no alternative to the backstop. \"The Irish backstop is a key part of the withdrawal agreement agreed between the British Government and the EU,\" a party spokesperson said.\"Boris Johnson voted in favour of this agreement and the backstop it contains. The EU have repeatedly made it clear that the backstop is not open for renegotiation.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said: \"The search for so-called alternative arrangements is like a quest for fools gold.\"This is a distraction from the Government facing up to the real choices. The only way a hard border can be avoided is through sufficient regulatory and customs alignment.\"TUV leader Jim Allister said: \"The EU claim that unless the UK signs up to the backstop to avoid a border they will impose a border. That is a totally illogical position. The UK has said it will not impose a border. Dublin says it will not impose a border. Who is going to build this border \"Meanwhile, a Tory MP has claimed a solution has already been found to solve the backstop problem.Greg Hands, co-chair of the think-tank Prosperity UKs Alternative Arrangements Commission, said it has drawn up a series of \"administrative and technological measures\" which negated the need for a backstop.Writing in the Daily Mail, he said the proposals include a tiered \"trusted trader\" scheme, similar to that used between the US and Canada, which would \"cut down paperwork and avoid routine customs checks\" at the border.The commission also recommended carrying out checks on food and animals away from the border and \"enhanced economic zones\" straddling the border between Londonderry and Donegal and Newry and Dundalk, with \"tax breaks\" and a \"free trade zone\" to avoid duties on goods.However, Mr Hands admitted that the arrangements could not be set up in time for the current October  exit date and would take up to three years to deploy."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38415041.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/poll.jpg","title":"brexit poll saying majority backs irish sea border rejected by dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Brexit.https:www.belfasttelegraph news brexit brexit-poll-saying-majority-backs-irish-sea-border-rejected-by-dup-.htmlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph incoming article.ece d AUTOCROP h poll.jpgEmailA DUP MP has rejected the findings of a poll which revealed that almost three out of five voters in Northern Ireland would prefer a border down the Irish Sea to a hard Brexit.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the idea that more people here would rather remain closely aligned with the EU than the UK is in no way reflective of the community he represents.The survey carried out by Belfast-based polling and market research company LucidTalk asked people how they would vote in a referendum proposing that Northern Irelandremained aligned to the European Union, \"perhaps staying in the single market and the customs union\".Read MoreDire Brexit warnings of no-deal listed in leaked document dismissed by DUPAlex Kane: Boris Johnson could be tempted by Brexit backstop only for Northern IrelandCorbyn: Brexit

in the Irish Sea\" and would rather Northern Ireland remained more closely aligned with the EU than Great Britain.Some .% said they would reject the compromise, while .% said they did not know.Within the response, unionist voters were largely opposed to the prospect of breaking away from the United Kingdom in favour of the EU, with some % of Democratic Unionists and % of Ulster Unionists rejecting the idea.However, Sir Jeffrey questioned the level of support for staying aligned with the EU indicated by the LucidTalk poll, saying it contrasts with the views of his constituents in Lagan Valley.\"These polls by LucidTalk I dont think accurately reflect opinion,\" he told the Belfast .\"Their polling methods are not reflective of the wider community, especially on the unionist side.\"In contrast to the  of people that they poll, the people that I talk to in my own constituency do not share that view at all. data-dfpadtargetingSir Jeffrey Donaldson\"A clear majority of them would not support Northern Ireland being separated from the UK.\"As the UK hurtles towards its exit from the European Union, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said will go ahead with or without a deal on October , experts have warned that at least , jobs could be at risk in Northern Irelandan agreement is not reached.Sir Jeffrey said the survey has no bearing on his partys position of opposing the backstop and protecting links with the United Kingdom. data-dfpadtargetingMartina Anderson\"We believe that it is not in Northern Irelands best interests, economically or in any other way, to be torn away from Great Britain,\" he continued.He said the UK is one of the largest economies in the world.\"We export far more goods to Great Britain than we do to the rest of the world, including the EU combined, so I dont think it is a credible or rational approach that we should create barriers between ourselves and what is by far our biggest market.\" However, nationalist politicians said the poll is an accurate reflection of public opinion in Northern Ireland and comes as no surprise.An overwhelming number of nationalists opted for closer alignment with the EU, with % of Sinn Fein and SDLP voters who responded to the poll backing the Northern Ireland only backstop.Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson said the survey reinforces her view that more people would prefer a united Ireland as a means to staying within the EU than a potentially catastrophic crash-out.\"Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the majority are in support of a pathway back into the EU,\" she said.\"I think we need to acknowledge that the vast majority of people in the north voted against Brexit.\"If faced with the choice, they would prefer an enhanced border in the Irish Sea.\"Ms Anderson added: \"If unionists are surprised, they dont have their finger on the pulse of the people that they represent,\" she said.\"The majority of the people quite clearly dont want to see a hardened border.\"Also responding to the survey, SDLP Brexit spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said his only surprise is that the number of people who favour a border in the Irish Sea over a potential hard Brexit is not higher.\"Brexit has been an absolute calamity which looks about to end in a disastrous no-deal,\" the West Tyrone MLA said.\"This will be bad for business, trade and commerce.\"It will especially hit people hard along the border.\"A united Ireland has become a reality for many now and not just an aspiration.\"It should be no surprise to anyone that a further majority wants to avoid a hard border on this island that would interrupt integrated supply chains, damage our economy and bring hardship to border communities.\"Its sadly also no surprise that the DUP continues to ignore the wishes of most people.\"The Tory-DUP Government at Westminster has no mandate for a no-deal exit.\"The majority of middle ground voters also supported the compromise, with % of Alliance voters and % Green Party voters backing the proposition."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38421911.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/2008192-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"1000 children on waiting list yet trust returns half its

I make a reference to my go-to sound engineer  Gerry Craig  being a past pupil and so continues a ream of well-known characters in the local and national music scene who are former students of MAPA including  Roe, Ports, Soak, Touts, Balkan Alien Sound, Cherym, Sugarwolf, New Pagans  and  Foreign Owl. Grainne  continues that “once past levels  and  there are pathways for students to continue performing or to get into the technological side of the arts after which students do a HNC or HND which they can then top up to full honours degree at Leeds Beckett, Leeds College of Music or Paisley.

That sounds magic to me. The department maintains links with festivals which offer performance production opportunities including Stendhal and Celtronic. Students also participate annually in BBC introducingas well as ious shows and gigs throughout the year in venues around town culminating in the MAPA showcase which includes live performances of both music and dance as well as recorded pieces. “The space is versatile and state of the art”  Grainne  tells me “the theatre can adapt to accommodate band, theatre and dance performances, there are sound-proofed practice rooms, two recording studios and three computer suites of Mac computers with up-to-date software” which conjures up the image of the perfect environment to satisfy the most creative of minds out there.

A basis had been laid for future discussions.The CAIN website, whose workers are based at the Magee campus in Derry, provides an extensive range of information and source material on the conflict and politics from  to the present day.The site is used by a worldwide audience and has received more than  million visits since it was launched in March .Earlier this year, the Derry News revealed that it was under threat of closure but thanks to a staunch defence of the site mounted by academics and researchers, Ulster University announced a nine-month reprieve while funding options are explored.Around  documents relating to the years  and  have been added to the CAIN website as part of ongoing work involving the Ulster University and the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland .The latest additions will bring to more than , the number of PRONI records available on CAIN.Dr Brendan Lynn, CAIN Deputy Director, said the archive is delighted to have been able to continue its cooperation with PRONI and to update the existing section with material dealing with the years  and .Mr Lynn commented: “CAIN has always sought to work with and iniduals, groups and organisations with relevant information relating to the Northern Ireland ‘troubles’ in order to make it available on-line.“An obvious example of this has been the partnership that CAIN has developed with The Public Record Office of Northern Ireland . As the official archive for Northern Ireland, one of PRONI’s many responsibilities is to receive government records from the early s onwards and to make them available for researchers.“The development of ‘PRONI Records on CAIN’ therefore provides people with an opportunity to gain access to a selection of material from the official files, that to date, chart the period from  to .“Looking ahead both CAIN and PRONI hope to continue this work to enable researchers to examine the events and personalities involved in the evolving ‘peace process’ of the s which culminated with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in April .”‘Political stalemate’In terms of the latest documents, one of the most striking features of this material is that some of the issues which are so prominent today are the same ones which confronted politicians and policy makers back then.“For instance the search for an end to the political stalemate in Northern Ireland was dominated by a series of long, drawn out discussions – often referred to as the Brooke Mayhew talks of -.

Half-a-century on, this week has also seen contention and disturbances surrounding the Apprentice Boys of Derry annual parade in Derry-the very same demonstration that was the focal point for the beginning of serious violence exactly  years ago.But, whilst the events of August  in Derry without doubt played a pivotal role in shaping the following decades, in a wider context it was just one episode amongst many more fraught historical events of the last  years.The decade between - was undoubtedly one of the most consistently eventful in Ireland throughout the twentieth century.Within those ten years the country went through the campaign for Home Rule, World War One, the Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence, partition, the Irish Civil War and the foundation of the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Added to that were campaigns for social change exemplied by the  Lockout and the suffrage movement.In combined effect, each of these hugely momentous events left no strata of Irish society untouched or unscathed by the violence that emanated from them. And, the historical shockwaves of some of these events, most particularly partition, also shaped future events in Northern Ireland that literally exploded onto the streets in the late s.In the Republic of Ireland concerted efforts have been made in recent years to make this decade of centenaries more inclusive and tolerant and respectful. The civic remembrance of those Irish men who fought and died on the British side in WWI has grown for example and the previously unthinkable visit to Dublin by an English monarch has taken place.Republican leaders once sworn to end Queen Elizabeth II’s reign in Northern Ireland by any means necessary have greeted her with handshakes and smiles. Uncomfortable conversations around these events have also taken place.In the North, still three years away from the conclusion of this decade of th anniversaries, there is the looming prospect of how the creation of Northern Ireland will be dealt with by nationalists and republicans.The outward signs at least are of course currently not good, encapsulated as they are by the ongoing absence of Stormont. Overlapping it all is the fact that in the North the events of  years ago are beginning to come full circle into the realm of major time passed milestones.So, half-a-century after the Civil Rights movement rocked the foundations of the Northern state to their core, how have we dealt to date with the commemoration of seminal historical events north of the border Professor Peter Shirlow is Director at the Institute of Irish Studies at University of Liverpool and was formerly Deputy Director of the Institute of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice at Queen’s University. He has undertaken conflict transformation work in Northern Ireland and has used his knowledge to work with former combatants and non-governmental organisations in Yugoslavia, Moldova, Bahrain and Iraq.“I think we have dealt with these issues in ways that have shown a lot of maturity, especially when it came to commemorating .“There was a lot of stretching beyond previously comfortable positions and remembering for example the children and the Royal Irish Constabulary who were killed and a realisation that conflict is just not about the commemoration of those who were on ‘your’ side. We are also beginning to look at women in this period who were made invisible.“There are many ways in which to understand what happened and they are a lot more erse than we have been told, but we haven’t yet built this into ways of how to deal with our past,” Peter Shirlow said.The insistence within each community that their version of the stories of the past are the ‘righteous’ versions has been at the root of inter-communal stre even decades after actual conflict has ceased. Heroic versions of the past are something that Peter Shirlow says that as a society we need to look beyond. He added that his research has indicated that Northern Ireland’s dferent cultures are not necessarily converging on that issue as yet.Professor Shirlow is also the Independent Chair of the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister Employers’ Guidance on Recruiting People with Conflict Related Convictions working Group.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHe told the Derry News: “I have found a very strong sense in the Protestant Unionist Loyalistcommunity that the conflict is finished and there’s a need to move on. They don’t want to engage because there’s a sense it’s in the past, that it’s over.“More people in the PUL community seem to have drawn a line under it-that it was  years ago, so there’s a reluctance to engage. A lot of loyalist prisoners came out and went back to work and don’t appear to have the same fascination with the Troubles.“The republican view of that is they believe loyalists do not want to engage because they are ashamed. It’s not a practical or a sensible view.“I’ve done a lot of research within Protestant working-class communities and there’s some acknowledgement of history, some reverence for Edward Carson and a degree of asking where we are going, but not a lot of interest in looking back at what happened during the Troubles.”The academic also said that he senses with the nationalist and republican community a need that their narrative of events “must be proven right.”So, the Derry News asked Peter Shirlow about how things will pan out when the centenary of the creation of Northern Ireland arrives It’s an issue he believes which still very much reverberates within the political sphere today.“The issue of partition is part of the inter-party talks at the minute. We will have to decide whether Northern Ireland is a ‘good place’ or a ‘bad place’.“We tend not to concentrate on what we have done well. Culturally we are globally renowned-from Van Morrison right through to Snow Patrol’s Crashing Cars being the most listened to song of the st century so far. In terms of sport we recently hosted The Open and we have names such as Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, but we don’t use what should symbolise the positive aspects but concentrate on the fractious issue of conflict. It makes us forget how globally regarded we are,” he said.Professor Shirlow also contends that the all invasive aspects of one-sided commemoration also often obscure the stories of human bravery and kindness that took place during the conflict.“There are stories of the Troubles where many people put their own lives in danger to save others. I know someone in Ardoyne who took a policeman into their home and him to stop him being killed. It stops the appreciation of victims being someone’s mother or father, son or daughter. And, I’m sure it’s the same in Derry.“Commemoration doesn’t look at a lot of le experiences or the fact that people on both sides took risks to help protect each other. Commemoration can largely be about the self.”The Derry News also asked Peter Shirlowhe thinks that at specic times, political parties push their ideas of commemoration onto their prospective voters to purposefully polarise communities “There is part of it that is a response to ‘your’ community and that symbolises that these events have power and politicians are sometimes trapped in that. But, of course parties will use that for their own ends.“If we united on issues like the health service, education, employment and the environment perhaps there wouldn’t be such a focus on identity. However, there are signs that people are exploring other ways to move forward,” he said.CAPTION: Professor Peter Shirlow, Director of the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool."},{"url":null,"title":"special creggan performance dedicated lyra mckee","story":"A special all-female performance of a play written by esteemed Irish dramatist Brian Friel took place in Creggan yesterday in memory of Lyra McKee.Art Over Borders’ th Lughnasa FrielFest paid tribute to the young writer and journalist who was killed in the city with a free performance of Brian Friel’s  play The Enemy Within.Two performances had been scheduled to take place in two churches, St. Columba’s Church of Ireland in Omagh, Friel’s birthplace, and All Saints Church of Ireland in the Waterside Derry on Saturday.However, festival organiser Arts Over Borders unexpectedly announced the additional free performance in Creggan.The Enemy Within is centred around Columbas room or cell in the Autumn of , on the island of Iona, off the West coast of Scotland.The entire play centres around issues such as ‘Who am I’ and ‘To whom am I connected ’Published in , Friel wrote the play connecting it to the social troubles at the time.Columbas enemies were not only limited to his inner self, but also to his own family. Even though he had left Ireland, presumably for good, his family held an immovable grip which crippled Columba in his work on Iona.This pressure contributes to the inner struggles Columba is forced through in several parts of the play.Yesterdays performance on the last day of the four-week festival was dedicated to the memory of Lyra McKee who was shot dead during rioting in the Creggan area on April  of this year.Her partner Sara Canning was invited along by the organisers. Derry born festival co-curators Sean Doran and Liam Browne felt it was appropriate and timely to honour the memory of Lyra McKee with this all-female world premiere presentation.Speaking to the Derry News, Mr Doran said: “Our international Brian Friel Festival is jointly held in Donegal and Derry, with the Derry location now celebrating the playwright’s more socio-political plays and themes of justice, gender and ethnicity.“To complement the Lughnasa FrielFest Donegal, Here I Come! we have given the title of OVERCOME to Derry’s Lughnasa FrielFest in recognition of Derry’s ability to continually overcome its challenges and to resonate  years on from the Civil Rights marches of  that were directly inspired by the Black American Civil Rights movement.“The Black spiritual singers Ruby Philogene MBE and Tayo Aluko will join the casts of Brian Friel’s The Enemy Within and The Freedom of the City offering sung preludes and interludes to the Omagh and Derry performances.”Mr Browne added: “We had the pleasure of working with Lyra previously when she kindly agreed to be part of a discussion  in our Home of St. Patrick Festival in Armagh in . On that occasion she explored the particular challenges that face young women today, the pressures to reveal, issues around identity, privacy and such.“The subjects which Friel explored throughout his work of gender, poverty, ethnicity, isolation and spirituality mirror the themes which also concerned Lyra and about which she wrote.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"llandrindod man mike complete last ever six marathons birthday","story":"Mike Hodges with one of previous marathon medals.

Then I got a local engineer to sandblast it and paint it so that is was like new and that cost another few thousand.ldquoThe rest of the cost will be spent on the build and the fit out inside. I reckon that even after we live in it for a while, it would still retain some valuewe wanted to sell itwe decide to travel again or rent it out. I see the cost as the equivalent to three yearsrsquo rent and itrsquos money not wasted as we still have something at the end of it.The tiny home concept mdashnormally one bed studio-style homes mdash has become popular for people looking for a simpler way of living in locations that they can change and without tying themselves down to massive mortgage.Michael, who is from Whiterock, and Alex, who is from Saintfield, discovered the concept while travelling and living in a small van in New Zealand for a year.ldquoI had been aware of tiny houses before we went to New Zealand and over there it is really popular, explained Michael. ldquoThey really are everywhere. Seeing how people live in these tiny houses inspired me that it could be done here too.ldquoWe lived in one of them during our time in New Zealand and loved it. It did simply our lives and it was a bit more sustainable which is a big thing is for us.ldquoWe donrsquot like the idea of renting for the next few years or being tied down to a mortgage and this allows us to be flexible, plus it is a bit adventurous.The couple, who first began to date after getting together at their leaving formal at Down High School, have designed their home with a galley kitchen with sitting area, a small shower room and loft bedroom in a building that is six metres long by . metres wide and . metres high.The house should be finished in time for Christmas and is kept near Lisbane where the couple try to work on it every day.Michael, a design engineer graduate, and Alex, who graduated in textile and design, are both working part-time jobs at the moment in order to devote themselves to the build.Michael said: ldquoWersquove done all the work ourselves in order to save money and to gain more skills. The exterior is nearly finished so we will be moving on to the interior soon.ldquoRegarding installing the utilities, some have pretty easy solutions and some are more dficult. As we would like some flexibility as to where we can park it, we donrsquot want to plug into mains electricity or the sewerage system, so the shower will be a standard shower with an instant water heater. Any grey water from the sink or shower will be probably be handled by some kind of natural filtration.Michael and Alex donrsquot yet know where they will site their home when it is finished but hope to place it on land owned by friends, or to rent out a field.They say that part of the reason to build their tiny home is financial, but also down to the way of le that living in such a small space brings with it.Michael said: ldquoWe like to do something more meaningful with our money and prefer travel experiences. We would rather not spend loads of money on a sofa mdash we would prefer to go travelling.He added: ldquoI would love to convert a camper van and go around Europe. I really donrsquot see the sense of buying up stuff and would rather have experiences that I would remember more.The couple want to have a cosy feeling to their home but not something too modern.Like caravans or boats, space is at a premium in a tiny house and Michael has designed stairs up to their loft bed so that extra storage can be built in.ldquoWe donrsquot have that much stuff which is good. Often when people do move into these small houses they find it dficult to get rid of a lot of stuff, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for play park upgrade  ","story":"MOTHERS in Ballynahinch are demanding that immediate improvements are made to the play park in Hillfoot Crescent.The women claim that due to vandalism and a lack of maintenance, the play facility is in dire need of an upgrade and is not fit for purpose to serve the needs of local children.The members of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association also say that the play facility is long overdue for some general weed tidying up by Newry, Mourne and Down Council which is responsible for it.A large group of women and children held an open meeting at the park last Thursday and invited local councillors to attend to see at first hand the poor state the park has declined into.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews told the mothers, grandmothers and children that Hillfoot Crescent was one of three local parks due to be upgraded by the council within the next two years.However, while Ursula Jess, secretary of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association, welcomed the news, she said that the association would still be pressing for some interim improvements.ldquoItrsquos good to hear that a new play facility upgrade is supposed to be in the pipeline but we need something done between now and then, she said.ldquoWe urgently need it upgraded as therersquos no summer seats and parents and minders either have to stand or sit on the grass to keep an eye on the children and itrsquos not good enough. The seats were burnt one by one years ago and never replaced sowe were to get summer seats between now and the upgrade, it would be helpful.Mrs Jess said that Hillfoot Crescent got a Lottery grant in the late s to install the park and over the years broken equipment has not been replaced.She added: ldquoItrsquos a massive park with a lot of potential. We still have some tyre swings, a climbing frame, a slide and baby swings. There used to be a basket ball hoop but that is away now.ldquoItrsquos all been down to vandalism and general wear and tear. When the little elephant rockers were broken, the council just came and took them away but they werenrsquot replaced.She said that the play arearsquos summer seats were only replaced on one occasion after local vandals burnt them and had have not been replaced for years.Mrs Jess said that the community has done its best to keep the play park safe by sweeping away any broken glass and rubbish and have raised money for equipment in the past.The play facility caters for a large numbers of families at Millbank Grove Windmill Gardens, Windmill Drive, Windmill View, Carlisle Park and further afield, added Mrs Jess.Cllr Andrews said that he welcomed the residentsrsquo invitation to come along and to find out about the play facility.He said: ldquoThe play facility at Hillfoot Crescent serves a big catchment area with new developments being built in recent years.ldquoI was very impressed by the excellent turnout of parents, neighbours and children to convey their frustrations, worries and concerns about the condition of the existing playground here and the sense of being forgotten about.ldquoThey are calling for an upgrade to state of the art play parks that others in the Rowallane District Electoral Areahave been supplied with in recent times.ldquoI was able to tell them that Hillfoot Crescent is included in the line-up for an upgrade to new state of the art equipment.ldquoI will be lobbying and supporting this call at council level for this much-needed new play park to go ahead speedily along with those for Darragh Cross and Kilmore.The councillor said the council will encourage local residents and children to have their say and input into the new playground.He was presented with a heart-felt plea from the children for their park to be improved which was written as a poem and presented to him.It read: ldquoOur park is dying, itrsquos so sad, No one cares that it looks so bad.A lick of paint a bench or two, A modern slide area all overdue, So come on Council what do you say  Help us out and let us play..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call to clean up Mary Street area of Crossgar  ","story":"CALLS have been issued for a clean-up of the Mary Street area in Crossgar.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews have highlighted the need for the work to be carried out following a recent visit to the village.Mr McGrath mdash who was in Crossgar along with Cllr Andrews to listen to residentsrsquo concerns mdash is keen to see a resolution to the issues in Mary Street.ldquoPaths at this part of the village have become very poorly neglected and a dumping ground for some, the MLA explained.ldquoThis is totally unacceptable at a location adjacent to residentsrsquo garages and homes and the issue needs to be addressed as soon as possible.Mr McGrath suggested that the Mary Street problems are indicative of a wider issue people and groups across the country are going to have to get to grips with mdash determining who is responsible for certain pockets of land.He continued: ldquoBy the time it takes to actually determine ownership of areas, the issue could have been sorted multiple times over.

The remaining minutes of the half were played at a hectic pace with some tremendous play on show.Sheila McGrath and Greville handed Westmeath a three-point lead before Mallon and Dowdall swapped points as the game entered added time.However, Down had the bit between their teeth and three inspirational scores from Finnuala Carr, Aoe Keown and Mallon brought the sides level at - to - with time practically up.Westmeath were not to be denied a first half lead and a converted Greville free sent her side in at the break with a hard-earned - to - lead.The second half was every bit as competitive with Down again dominating the share of possession, but they continued to struggle to put that advantage to good use.Frees from Greville and Mairead McCormick and a magical strike from McGrath suddenly had Westmeath - to - ahead after  minutes.Down went for broke and minutes after Mallon and McCormick exchanged points, the predatory Saoirse Sands struck with venom when she netted after taking control of a Fionnuala Carr free.Paula Gribben reduced the deficit to two points before Greville and Mallon again exchanged scores. Mallon was unerring in front of the posts and with four minutes remaining she left a point in it after scoring from play.Unfortunately, McCrossan took advantage of two more Down wides from frees when she gave her side a - to - lead with two minutes of added time played.Sara Louise Carr kept the pot boiling with a th point for Down, but this was the last score of the game as the referee blew the final whistle on the resumption of play.Down: M McNally, N Kelly, A Savage, C McGilligan, C Rocks, D Magee, K McMullan, A Keown , P Gribben , S L Carr , D Savage, S McCartan, N Mallon , C McGourty, F Carr .

Earlier this year, a planning application was submitted to formally designate the area as a car park for council vehicles and staff cars as well.Concerned residents who live nearby and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the remains of the townrsquos former workhouse as an ldquoeyesore, highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials say they have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.They explained that part of the land which has been sold to provide a new main entrance to the school includes an area which is currently used for council staff parking.The local authority is seeking planning approval to develop remaining land at the front and side of the old workhouse to provide parking for staff and its fleet of vehicles.In papers submitted ahead of todayrsquos planning meeting, it is confirmed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admit that the car park plan will impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.However, they confirm that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accept the parking plan in principle, provided the scheme respects the character of the area, suggesting that ldquosoft landscaping between banks of spaces with a low wall constructed to the western boundary.ldquoThe site is well established as the former Down Council offices, with a refuse depot to the rear, the planning papers continue.ldquoThe area has been used for staff parking with this application to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans to be parked at the side. The works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.Signicantly, the planning papers spell out clearly that the new parking at the front of the site will be laid out for vans and staff vehicles, not refuse vehicles.

However, just hours before it was due to start someone painted lsquoIRA on the wall in front of the nearby Pilson Hall.The spokesperson revealed that when the graffiti appeared last week they contacted a specialist cleaner to have it removed and were prepared to meet the financial cost. However, the businessman agreed to do the work for free.ldquoNo one in Mount Crescent or Bridge Street wants sectarian graffiti. It does not reflect the good people who live at this part of the town, the spokesperson declared.ldquoWe were left disgusted at what happened given that we are working hard to promote our area and secure new investment, just like many other community groups across Downpatrick. This despicable act was not done in our name and we condemn those responsible.ldquoWe are not prepared to let those responsible have a negative impact on the good people, from all religions and races, who live at this part of Downpatrick.

The graffiti daubed on the wall of Down High School in no way reflects the people of this area.The spokesperson said residents were left ldquoshocked and upset by what was written and were in the process of taking steps to have it removed when a local businessman stepped forward to do it.ldquoWe have a fair idea who was responsible for the graffiti and hope that they will be apprehended. We cannot emphasis enough that what happened was not done on our name and we condemn those behind this. We will not let people tarnish the work that we are doing or the good name of the Mount Crescent and Bridge Street area.ldquoWe hope the fact that we took steps to contact a specialist cleaner when we were made aware of the graffiti speaks volumes about our views on this matter. Those responsible are clearly not aware of what we are about and the respect we have for all our neighbours across Downpatrick.The spokesperson added: ldquoWe will not allow what happened to drive a wedge between us and others. If those responsible hoped the finger of blame would be pointed at us, they have failed.

They might easily mistake it for just another addition to the shelf of new books marking the th anniversary of the Troubles and then cast their eye where. That would be a mistake, for this is more than just another history. It is, in fact, a remarkable insight into Northern Ireland from one of its best writers and most thoughtful observers: one of the few capable of choosing a detached observation point and looking at the problem from dferent angles. Maybe that#s something to do with his passion for photography and an instinct for knowing that the most tellingly accurate shot is never the most obvious one. Anyway, this is the best book that O#Doherty has written.I’m not even sure I would describe the book as history. It is a memoir, the personal reflections of someone old enough – he was  in  – to remember the start of the conflict and yet curious enough to want to know what was going on around him when so many others were putting their heads down, or just accepting the narratives presented from within their own tribe. He retains that curiosity. He also retains a dislike for one-sided, blinkered interpretations the sort of interpretations which ignore the flaws on your own side of the fence, while contentedly blaming ‘themuns’ for everything. In a piece to accompany the publication of the book, he wrote: ‘My book seeks to be a corrective to our history which gives too much signicance to people who did harm and ignored those who made such a dference that now even the political offsprings of the paramilitaries have had to adopt the agendas of gay rights and abortion law reform.’ The Troubles isn’t just a stand-alone event. It isn’t just one story, either. It is the story of everyone of us who lived through it . It is thousands, hundreds-of-thousands of stories, each one from a slightly dferent perspective and each one as important and valid as all the others.O’Doherty is right to say that the stories we hear most are those of iniduals and organisations who want to present themselves as victors of some sort or, at the very least, as justied in what they did. These are the voices and narratives which have tended to drown out the work of those who never lted a gun or planted a bomb, yet whose crucially important work can now be seen in what might be described as a post-conflict revolution which actually began years before the Good Friday Agreement..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button As he notes: ‘The issues on which people are campaigning are more concerned with human rights than with civil rights, with the right of the inidual to identy by orientation or gender or nationality. These issues are less about the relationship between the citizen and the state, as in , and more about the citizen’s sense of self and entitlement to relate to others. The causes are more secular and liberal, though there are counter-causes too, which would put us into a more conservative and religious polity...We still have a ided society that seems to want to ide wider issues between the sectarian factions. So unionists now oppose abortion, same-sex marriage and support Israel while nationalists, broadly speaking, support abortion, same-sex marriage and Palestine.’Personally, I think he’s wrong on the latter point. Increasing numbers of unionists, particularly younger ones, seem comfortable with same-sex marriage and abortion reform and I think the DUP will sht on those issues fairly soon. Stupidly, though, elements of unionism got it into their heads that those issues were, somehow, Sinn Fein demands which is why there was is a reluctance to embrace them as part of a perfectly sensible strategy of equality of citizenship across the entire UK. But I do accept his broader point about the continuing tendency to ide certain issues between the sectarian factions. I was particularly struck by an observation about Jamie Bryson and Lyra McKee: ‘She was the same age as Jamie but represented something , a secular liberal trend in society, away from the old ision. There are still young people like Jamie, as passionate as their forebears about the old quarrel, and some like Lyra for whom the past is a curiosity, not a commitment.’ There were people like Jamie and Lyra in the summer of , too. There will probably be people like Jamie and Lyra in . O’Doherty doesn’t opt for a conclusion or firm prediction: he’s canny enough to know that the usual rules of commentary and observation have never applied to Northern Ireland. But running through his book is the oddly optimistic sense that things are never quite what they seem here meaning that anything, at anytime, is possible. Most people do get on with their lives and always have done, with hundreds of micro organisations and mostly unknown iniduals making the sort of dferences-for-the-better that only become obvious years later. Maybe that is the best we can hope for. If so, it strikes me as a much better option than the industrial-scale rewriting of history and opening of old sores that fill the pages of far too many us-and-them histories landing on my desk.Declassied files: We may not check gun forensics, NIO told IRA and loyalistsDeclassied files: Needham tried to dress up border checkpoints for tourists Coremetrics  Coremetrics

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

has joined forces with Councils in Northern Ireland in a bid to prevent dogs dying in hot cars this summer and to raise awareness on summer safety for our canine friends.Just a few minutes in a hot car can prove fatal for dogs and yet every year animal welfare charities and the police receive thousands of reports of animals being left alone in cars on warm days.That’s why together with Dogs Trust, Councils across Northern Ireland are running ‘Summer Fun for Cool Canines’ events as part of the Dogs Die in Hot Cars campaign, to raise awareness about the dangers of leaving dogs in hot cars and to provide dog owners with practical tips to keep their dog cool and safe this summer.Laura McAnea, Campaigns Manager at Dogs Trust, said: “Many people still believe that it’s OK to leave a dog in a car on a warm daythe windows are left open or they’re parked in the shade, but the truth is, it’s not.“A car can become as hot as an oven very quickly, even when it doesn’t feel that warm and a dog can die in a hot car in  minutes. When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise. Without such a commitment and associated action from our elected representatives, we risk irreparable damage to our economy and our society for which future generations will judge us harshly.””  The letter has been signed by the following organisations: Belfast Chamber Causeway Chamber of Commerce CBI NI Centre for Competitiveness Construction Employers Federation NI Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association Hospitality Ulster IoD NI Londonderry Chamber of Commerce Manufacturing NI Mineral Products Association NI Newry Chamber of Commerce  Trade NI Grain Trade Association NI Hotels Federation NI Tourism Alliance Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association Northern Ireland Retail Consortium Retail NI Women in Business NIView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/qub_1.jpg","title":"ulster business top  sees sales rise by ","story":"Posted on Monday August  by Ulster Business Michael Neill, head of office, AL Goodbody Belfast, sponsor of the Top , Flavio Malnarcic, chief financial officer, Moy Park and Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest businesses have seen sales rise by .% to more £.bn, the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list  has revealed.The list, sponsored by AL Goodbody, showcases the successes of the biggest firms from right across Northern Ireland.

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods.

Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m.

Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company’s total tangible assets minus the company’s total liabilities. A business’s tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time.

Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company.
