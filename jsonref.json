Kim Jong-un bragged that the new weapon would bring \u0027inescapable distress\u0027 to \u0027fat targets\u0027 who could be hit by the weapon, including Seoul and a nearby US military base         Kim was accompanied for the launch by his top defence advisers and nuclear specialists including Ri Pyong-chol (far right), Kim Jong-sik (second left) and Jang Chang-ha (left)         Kim Jong-un is attempting to pressure the US and South Korea into abandoning joint military drills, and return to the negotiating table         The North\u0027s state media release an image of the missile\u0027s launch platform, but had heavily pixellated it in an unusual move for the Hermit KingdomHe told Fox Business: \u0027But you have to ask when the real diplomacy is going to begin, when the working-level discussions on denuclearization will begin, as Kim Jong Un again said on June 30 he was prepared to do. \u0027We\u0027re still waiting to hear from North Korea.\u0027Kim Dong-yub, an analyst from Seoul\u0027s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said the North might have tested an improved version of its 300-millimeter multiple rocket launcher system or an entirely new system, such as 400-millimeter rockets.When asked whether it failed to distinguish between multiple-rocket launchers and ballistic missiles, the JCS said South Korean and U.S. militaries shared an assessment that the flight characteristics from Wednesday\u0027s launches were similar to North Korea\u0027s new short-range missiles tested last week. JCS official Kim Joon-rak said further analysis was needed to identify the weapons.South Korea\u0027s military had said the flight data of the missile launched last week showed similarities to the Russian-made Iskander, a solid-fuel, nuclear-capable missile that is highly maneuverable and travels on lower trajectories compared to conventional ballistic weapons.Choi Hyun-soo, spokeswoman of Seoul\u0027s Defense Ministry, refused to answer when asked whether it\u0027s possible that the North might have mixed in a ballistic missile launch while testing its new rocket system.In a closed-door briefing to lawmakers, officials from South Korea\u0027s National Intelligence Service said North Korea might extend its weapons tests into August.        Wednesday\u0027s test came less than a week after the Hermit Kingdom fired a short-range ballistic missile (pictured) which flew 370 miles into the Sea of Japan          One of Thursday\u0027s missiles flew around 430 miles out into the Sea of Japan before splashing down into the ocean. Pictured: Kim Kong-Un inspecting a newly built submarineThe spy agency believes the North would want to demonstrate its displeasure over the planned U.S.-South Korea military exercises and the South\u0027s acquisition of advanced weapons such as F-35 fighter jets while also speeding up its own weapons development before it gets deeper in nuclear negotiations with the United States, lawmaker Lee Eun-jae said.U.S. officials have downplayed the threat of the launches to the United States and its allies.Analysts say North Korea, with its consecutive weapons tests, is demonstrating displeasure with the pace of nuclear diplomacy with Washington. The North\u0027s testing activity could intensify if the negotiations do not proceed rapidly over the next few months, said Srinivasan Sitaraman, a North Korea expert at Clark University in Massachusetts.By firing weapons that directly threaten South Korea but not the U.S. mainland or its Pacific territories, North Korea also appears to be dialing up pressure on Seoul and testing how far Washington will tolerate its bellicosity without actually causing the nuclear negotiations to collapse, other experts say.Last Thursday, North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles that Seoul officials said flew 600 kilometers (370 miles) and as high as 50 kilometers (30 miles) before landing in the sea. North Korea said those tests also were supervised by Kim and were designed to deliver a \u0027solemn warning\u0027 to South Korea over its purchase of high-tech, U.S.-made fighter jets and the planned military drills, which Pyongyang calls an invasion rehearsal. The North also tested short-range missiles on May 4 and 9.Earlier last week, Kim visited a newly built submarine and expressed his satisfaction with its weapons system. North Korea said its deployment was \u0027near at hand.\u0027In a private briefing to lawmakers Wednesday, South Korean military intelligence officers said they\u0027ve determined that the submarine likely has three launch tubes for missiles. If confirmed, it would be North Korea\u0027s first operational submarine with missile launch tubes, some experts said."},{"url":null,"title":"Payment type select Hilarious Poundland self service checkouts Yoda voiceover","story":"Share this article However, some shoppers were less impressed and questioned why the voice of Yoda had been selected to narrate the self-scan machines.In a Facebook post to Poundland, Donna Perkins wrote: \u0027So what the hell has Yoda got to do with health and beauty? Maybe cut out silly voices on the SCO\u0027s and get them to work faster.\u0027              Leigh Wilson, 36, told MailOnline that he loved hearing the Jedi\u0027s back-to-front sentences during his recent trip to the Walsall branchAnd Joanne Varney tweeted: \u0027Love a good look around Poundland but if they don\u0027t take that very annoying Yoda voice off of their checkouts I wont be going back.\u0027Yoda, who was originally voiced by puppeteer Frank Oz, is notorious for jumbling up words in sentences.Shoppers gleefully recalled being asked to \u0027take items from bagging area, you must\u0027 and \u0027use the force, payment type you must select\u0027. While the social media reaction to Yoda was mixed, many questioned the decision behind the company choosing the Jedi to narrate the machines. A company spokesperson told MailOnline: \u0027Like humour, you must at Poundland.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Motorcyclists avoid ploughing Land Rover came bend wrong road","story":"Share this article \u0027We were out for a ride, just a fun morning ride out as usual.\u0027All of a sudden, this car appeared on our side of the road.\u0027There was no time to think - we just got out of the way.

One guy even headbutted me. In retrospect, I think it was a sign of acceptance’I was in my mid-20s when Cornell Capa, director of the International Center of Photography in New York, recommended me for a job documenting life in the American sector of Berlin while the city was still ided. As a young photographer, I was so nervous. All of these senior German officials were swanning around my studio inspecting my work.I blurted out that I wasn’t American, that I was born in Canada, almost like a confession. I felt I had to tell them. They just looked at me quizzically, laughed and started speaking in German. I have no idea what they thought of me. But I got the job.In the west, I discovered a different side to the disorder. Every Saturday, punks would hang out, drink beer and blare music through their soundsystems. Cars would be set alight and bank windows smashed in. The cops would arrive, teargas them and send them running to find shelter in nearby bars, and the whole cycle would repeat. They were sceptical of me to begin with. One guy even headbutted me. In retrospect, I think that was a sign of acceptance.Getting to know them wasn’t easy, and it happened in the strangest of ways. I would carry a bunch of bananas to snack on while I wandered the streets. When I found the punks, I didn’t know what to say, so I offered them bananas. They just laughed at me. But they must have liked it, because they welcomed me into their crew.As I got to know them, I realised they fitted into the idea of the “wall sickness”, but they were the manic side of the depression that reigned in the east. There was something psychotic about punk at the time. These weren’t just weekend punks and “punk” wasn’t just a look – this was their life.The woman in this shot was called Miriam, and the rat on her shoulder is called Bestia. It was a week or so before Reagan was planning to visit, and there were windows smashed all over the city in protest. Despite the violence and the militancy, she was extremely gentle. She was big, much bigger than me, but she had a soft way of gesturing and moving.She invited me to her place, a nearby squat. We hung out, drank tea, took some shots and became friends. She introduced me to her rat, Bestia, who lived in her oven. Being a squat, it had no electricity, so it was perfectly safe. Bestia was almost like a  angel for Miriam, keeping her safe amid the anarchy. I think it was useful to keep guys off her back, too – nobody’s messing when you have a rat draped around your neck.People feel this image represents a moment in Berlin’s history, or the punk movement more broadly, but to me it’s a shot of someone I got to know, who welcomed me into a hard-to-reach scene. It was a doorway for me into other activist and protest scenes, and I remember the time fondly.People seem to think that punk has died, and maybe elements of the aesthetic have. But the spirit of punk was so much more than a look, and I think that lives on, albeit in different forms. I think we saw it in the Occupy movement, within elements of the Arab spring, and I think we are seeing it today in the UK with Extinction Rebellion.Training: Film and television production, New York University.Influences: Diane Arbus, Brassaï, the Capa brothers, Eikoh Hosoe, André Kertész, Dorothea Lange, Helen Levitt, Mary Ellen Mark, László Moholy-Nagy, Gordon Parks, Thomas Ruff, Aaron Siskind, Francesca Woodman.Low point: “A life-changing accident on a film set in 1979.”Top tip: “Draw with your eyes.

Can we learn to love it again, asks Dana CzapnikHere’s a thought. Teen angst, once regarded as stubbornly generic, is actually a product of each person’s unique circumstances: gender, race, class, era. Angst is universal, but the content of it is particular.This might explain why Holden Caulfield, once the universal everyteen, does not speak to this generation in the way he’s spoken to young people in the past. Electric Literature gave this explanation of The Catcher in the Rye’s datedness: “If you’re a white, relatively affluent, permanently grouchy young man with no real problems at all, it’s extraordinarily relatable. The problem comes when you’re not. Where’s The Catcher in the Rye for the majority of readers who are too non-young, non-white, and non-male to be able to stand listening to Holden Caulfield feel sorry for himself?”On the one hand, Yes! On the other, Oof!I’ve had conversations about Catcher with undergraduate students in creative writing classes I’ve taught, and every one has complained about disliking Holden. In my limited network of young people, Catcher is not only no longer beloved, it has become something even more tragic: uncool.But is it as simple as Electric Literature posits – that if you’re not white, privileged and male, it’s hard to see yourself in Holden? After all, this is partly why I wrote my coming-of-age novel The Falconer, told from the perspective of a young woman in early 1990s New York. Maybe hating on Holden has turned into its own form of adolescent rebellion. Catcher was an incendiary novel when it was first published and was banned from many school districts. Reading it once felt subversive now it’s a reliable presence on most curriculums. And once adults tell you something’s good, aren’t you supposed to hate it?But it’s not just girls and kids of colour who are turned off by Holden I have found that my white, male students didn’t like him either. I spoke with several New York City public school English teachers, who all confirmed my suspicion that it’s not just Holden’s identity that keeps him from resonating with younger readers – though that’s part of it.Instead, broad shifts within culture have rendered Holden’s malaise annoying instead of resonant. For one thing, the concept of Holden’s total isolation from the adult world – the molten core of the novel – is anathema to kids who have come of age in a culture where they are precious and valued.In Salinger’s era, a struggling, depressed teen had to pick himself up by the bootstraps and be a man. The idea that he could wander through New York for a couple of days, unaccounted for, without any contact from an adult in his life must seem completely foreign to kids today, who are kept on tight leashes. A parent can watch their child’s exact geolocation from a handheld device. Holden had much more freedom, but it came with a heaping side order of neglect.Though young people today are more carefully watched, they’re also looking out at the adult world and seeing very clearly that it has gone absolutely mad. How can one get all worked up about some “phony” classmate or a brother who sold out to Hollywood (is selling out even a thing any more?) when earlier that morning you did an active shooter drill in homeroom? Or when it’s possible the Earth might be uninhabitable within your lifetime and the grownups are doing nothing about it? Holden’s melancholia feels positively quaint in comparison to the problems kids face today.I’ve read Catcher at a few different stages of my life, and it’s changed each time. First at the age of 13, as part of my education as a New York City kid attending a progressive private school on the Upper West Side (just a Central Park away from Holden’s stomping grounds), then again on my own at 17, when I was mainlining ennui and noticing how disappointing people were. So I fell in love.When I was about to graduate college at 21 and feeling that morphine drip of nostalgia that accompanies points of departure in youth, I read Catcher again in search of my old friend. But by then, Holden’s appeal had worn off. I’d figured out sensitive and angry young men usually reserved their sensitivity for themselves. It was like bumping into an old crush and realising that everything you ever liked about them was a projection. After I turned the last page I thought, “What did I ever see in that guy?” As with most things in life, reading Catcher is all about timing.I’m closer now to 40 than to 17. I no longer read to find friends in literature – I read for the writing. So when I recently read the book for the fourth time, I saw something brand new and I think closer to what Salinger intended: a perfectly written portrait of an imperfect character. Every syllable sings. Much of what I saw in this fourth reading, I had completely missed before.Which puts Catcher in a bit of a Catch-22. Kids who are reading to fall in love with a book no longer relate to Holden, and adult readers who appreciate the craftsmanship are too old to be struck by it emotionally.So, here’s my proposal to readers coming to The Catcher in the Rye for the first time now: read it as early as possible in your life. Read it alongside Ralph Ellison, Sylvia Plath, James Baldwin, Junot Díaz, Toni Morrison, André Aciman and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Hate it if you must. Rail against Holden. Call him a spoiled brat. When it comes to all the money and opportunity he squanders, he is! Let 20 years pass. Let the world wash over you, then read it again. You might see Holden for who he really is. Not a stand-in for every single teenager that ever walked the Earth, but a lonely inidual who finds the injustices of the world intolerable.• The Falconer by Dana Czapnik is out now (Faber \u0026amp Faber)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/668e778b21754e516600f74a9b95628371ee898c/0_213_3925_2355/master/3925.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c276a4d5e57f775c00f24f46f3e580e","title":"burger king impossible whopper nationwide plant based","story":"Burger King will begin selling the plant-based Impossible Whopper across the US next week after a successful run in six regions.The rollout to 7,000 locations will be for a limited time, a typical practice in the fast-food industry for new products. The chain will not say how many of the burgers it has sold since first introducing them in April, but did say it is enticing more people to enter its stores.Impossible Foods, the company that makes the burgers for Burger King and White Castle, is struggling to meet surging demand. On Thursday it announced a new partnership with OSI, one of the world’s largest food producers.Impossible Foods has doubled the workers at its plant and produced a record number of burgers in June, but demand is still outpacing production.Impossible Foods introduced the burger as the veggie patty that “bleeds” at the high-end New York restaurant Momofuku in 2016. The burger is a feat of food engineering, attaining its red color from genetically modified yeast.Demand for plant-based meat alternatives has surged in the last two years as companies pitch the products to consumers conscious of meat’s contribution to the global climate crisis.The company’s largest rival, Beyond Meat, went public this summer, growing sales and its stock price rapidly after entering the stock market. Beyond Meat’s sales are also buoyed by a patty – the Beyond burger.Both Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat are competing to offer their products in fast-food chains and directly to consumers – and struggling to meet demand.Just eight days before Burger King announced the Impossible Whopper, Dunkin’ announced it would offer Beyond sausage patties on breakfast sandwiches in New York City.

What if Lord Halifax rather than Churchill had become prime minister in May 1940? To the “what if” history book could soon be added a new chapter – “what if” the UK had exited the EU with a deal in October 2019?That, despite everything that has been happening at Westminster in the past week, remains the assumption of the Bank of England. In its last inflation report before the Brexit deadline, the Bank said its base case was a smooth transition to a UK-EU trade deal. Its projections do not include the possibility of a no-deal exit.Johnson\u0026nbsptold the Treasury select committee\u0026nbspin March 2016:\u0026nbsp“Our relationship with the EU is already very well developed. It doesn’t seem to me to be very hard … to do a free trade deal very rapidly indeed.”Speaking at a Vote Leave event\u0026nbspin March 2016, Johnson said:\u0026nbsp“I put it to you, all those who say that there would be barriers to trade with Europe if we were to do a Brexit, do you seriously believe that they would put up tariffs against UK produce of any kind, when they know how much they want to sell us their cake, their champagne, their cheese from France? It is totally and utterly absurd.”Johnson, then foreign secretary,\u0026nbsptold the House of Commons in July 2017:“There is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a great deal.”Two months before the June 2016 referendum vote,\u0026nbspRaab told Andrew Neil on BBC Sunday Politics:\u0026nbsp“We’re very well placed, and mutual self-interest suggests we’d cut a very good deal and it’s certainly not in the European’s interests to erect trade barriers.”During an appearance\u0026nbspon the BBC’s Daily Politics in April 2016, Raab added: “The idea that Britain would be apocalyptically off the cliff edge if we left the EU is silly.”In\u0026nbspApril 2016, Michael Gove said the UK would have the best of both worlds. “Outside the EU, we would still benefit from the free trade zone which stretches from Iceland to the Russian border,” he said. “But we wouldn’t have all the EU regulations which cost our economy £600m every week.”After the referendum, in July 2017, the then-international trade secretary\u0026nbspLiam Fox said: “The free trade agreement that we will have to do with the European Union should be one of the easiest in human history. We are already beginning with zero tariffs, and we are already beginning at the point of maximal regulatory equivalence, as it is called. In other words, our rules and our laws are exactly the same.”This complicates matters for the Bank because it uses the current exchange rate and the expected path of interest rates to produce its forecasts even though its Brexit assumptions are more benign. That, as the Bank freely admits, leads to “inconsistencies” in the forecast.And the report was modestly tougher than the City might have been anticipating. The City fully expects the Bank to cut rates in the event of a no-deal Brexit: the Bank is maintaining its line that borrowing costs could go either way.What’s more, even if a deal led to a rise in the value of the pound and higher interest rates than currently expected, the monetary policy committee thinks that further action would be needed to prevent the economy from overheating.By the time of the next inflation report in November a lot will have become clearer. For now, the Bank’s forecasts are even more of a stab in the dark than usual.Cricket fans tuning in for the first day of the Ashes had something of a shock. Not the flurry of early Australian wickets but the fact that between overs a new ban meant they were spared the customary barrage of TV gambling ads. Football fans will also notice the difference because the rules apply to all live sporting events apart from horse and greyhound racing shown before the 9pm watershed.Anybody who thinks this represents a crushing defeat for the gambling industry is mistaken. To be sure, the ban reverses the wrong-headed 2005 decision of Tony Blair’s government to allow casinos and bookies to advertise on TV for the first time.But this is not a game-changer when it comes to protecting children and the vulnerable from the risks of gambling addiction. For one thing, the gambling industry, like the best spin bowlers, knows how to mix things up. Online advertising and direct mail shots are more important marketing devices than TV ads these days.What’s more, there will still be gambling ads during sporting events on TV, courtesy of shirt sponsorship deals and the advertising hoardings round the perimeters of grounds.Put simply, the gambling industry has weighed up the odds. The voluntary ban is a hedge against the risk of tougher legislation in the future that might have far greater financial implications. The fact that the most vocal opponents of the change have been the TV companies speaks volumes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/900802b098927515e5d7d2357be740ce4d402fe8/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e46842111b829efa09498830a1133a46","title":"london stock exchange over 300 years and counting","story":"From its coffee house roots to becoming a data and markets giant, LSE’s history has been eventfulLike many British financial institutions, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) sprang up informally rather than being organised by the government. The exchange’s 300-year history from its roots in City of London coffee houses to a $27bn (£22bn) deal to form a financial data and markets giant have been eventful.The exchange was formally established in 1773 by a group of stockbrokers who had been trading in the area’s coffee houses. This set-up was in place for more than a century because stockbrokers were deemed too uncouth to be allowed into the Royal Exchange which was established as the City’s centre of commerce in 1571.At the most prominent of these venues, Jonathan’s Coffee House, John Castaing started publishing a list of prices for stocks and commodities in 1698, establishing the trading of securities in London. In 1801 a group of stock exchange members raised money for the construction of a building in Capel Court in the City and a rule book was introduced a decade later.The flow of financial information was transformed in 1830 when the electric telegraph began transmitting prices by ticker tape. Company announcements were also pinned up on noticeboards at the LSE.By the first world war the City was the world’s largest financial centre and the LSE was the biggest exchange. The exchange closed for five months at the start of the war and was restricted when it reopened, prompting almost 1,000 members to leave by 1918. The LSE closed for six days at the start of second world war and was bombed in 1940.Business boomed in the late 1950s and the LSE began looking for bigger premises. Work began on the 26-floor Stock Exchange Tower in 1967 and the building was opened in 1972.The following year and on the recommendation of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission – subsequently replaced by the Competition Commission – the LSE allowed women and foreign-born traders on to the trading floor. The LSE also merged with 11 British and Irish regional exchanges.The 1980s brought arguably the biggest shake-up in the LSE’s history. The Thatcher government ordered a series of changes known as the “Big Bang” that scrapped the distinction between jobbers and brokers and replaced open outcry dealing with screen-based trading. Critics of the measures have argued that retail banks buying up stockbrokers helped lead to the financial crisis.An IRA bomb destroyed the public viewing areas at Stock Exchange Tower in 1990 and would have caused deaths or injuries without a warning half an hour before the blast. The public viewing area, whose use had dwindled after the end of open outcry, shut in 1992.The LSE floated in 2001, led by its then chief executive Clara Furse. It was a takeover target throughout the 2000s, rejecting approaches from Nasdaq, Deutsche Börse and Macquarie, an Australian bank. The LSE did its own deals, buying Borsa Italiana in 2007 and taking full control of FTSE International by acquiring Pearson’s stake in 2011.The European commission blocked the LSE’s attempted friendly merger with Deutsche Börse in 2017. The following year the LSE hit one of the lowest points in its history when its board got caught in a public battle with a shareholder over the ousting of Xavier Rolet as chief executive.After a six-month search the LSE appointed David Schwimmer, a Goldman Sachs banker, as its chief executive in April 2018. Living up to his dealmaking reputation, Schwimmer has agreed to buy Refinitiv, Thomson Reuters’ former financial information business, turning the LSE into a rival to Michael Bloomberg’s data empire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a3cb43032f8eee5b54fb0b24b4193dfa7cc3b09/0_195_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c78332aa38d7fd90f272e41738b2c9c3","title":"roaming cafes and pirate boats readers favourite floating traders","story":"We asked you to recommend canal boat shops, and you did not disappointFrom home brew kits to pirate-themed gifts, when we asked for your favourite canal boat shops, you certainly gave us variety. Lisa Ashwood told us about a floating sweetshop that she was thrilled to discover near the end of a long, tiring run from Buxton to her home village. “We were all flagging and the sudden discovery of a sweetshop canal boat was just too exciting,” she says.Few things symbolise the way our cities have transformed more than canals. Around the world, cities have woken up to the power of their urban waterways: from Milan to Manchester, the former economic arteries of industry are being turned into corridors for walkers, boaters and wildlife. Cafes and restaurants are proliferating and canalside living is newly chic – and newly costly.\u0026nbspAs commercial interests muscle in on the last great undeveloped bit of Britain’s cities,  Cities and the Observer wanted to take stock of a crucial moment in history, when we still have a choice: whether to turn canals into sanitised enclaves of wealth, or preserve them as a precious resource for all.Kevin Hall told us about a boat that sells Staffordshire oatcakes filled with cheese and bacon, which is often moored near Stoke City’s Bet365 football stadium on match days. And several of you got in touch with glowing endorsements of Sam Skinner’s floating bike repair service (a photo of which we included in our original callout). Here are a selection of your responses:“My favourite boat traders are without doubt the Home Brew Boat. They sell all sorts of home brew equipment and are responsible for getting my husband into home brewing. They continuously cruise, mainly in the north-west and Midlands but have a thriving mail order part to their business and Barry is always happy to answer questions or have his expertise tapped.“We love it when we are in their vicinity. Barry and Sandra are such engaging and enthusiastic proprietors that passing the time of day with them is always enjoyable and often leads to us buying yet more home brew stuff. When our supplies run low and we are not nearby we make use of mail order. As a sideline they sell Barry’s greetings cards which are printed with fabulous photos he’s taken (he was a professional photographer for 30 years before taking to the canals).” Helen Tidy, Aldridge“Cake on the Cut is run by Sam Keay on a narrowboat called Squox and Botter. Not only is it a fantastic cafe boat selling lots of yummy cakes and treats, she makes and sells Gangplank Spirits and Preserves which are produced with foraged fruit and herbs. Super tasty! A friendly trader with a very unusual paint job on her narrowboat – both sides are different and depict scenes of nature. She always sets up her roaming cafe with lots of cute tables, chairs, flowers and sometimes hammocks.” Katie lives on a narrowboat in Hertfordshire“The Pirate Boat sells various items, which all have a pirate theme. The last time we visited it was also selling ice cream and hot drinks. My kids absolutely love visiting this boat – the owner is a real character, she dresses like a pirate and interacts with everyone. My little boy was ecstatic when she handed him an inflatable sword and proceeded to have a play sword fight with him.” Anonymous“My favourite narrowboat is based on the Upper Peak Forest canal (and seen on the Macclesfield canal and also the Middlewich to Macclesfield stretch of the Trent and Mersey canal). The boat is called Andechs and an online music school is run from on board. They offer a huge range of live online instrumental music lessons provided by their music teachers who are based all over the world. I love the idea of their use of the latest technology from what was once the latest technology over 200 years ago, when the canals were built for very different commercial use.” Richard Foster, New Mills, Derbyshire“Hekla was in Watford last week, Mile End market this week, and who knows where next week. They’re a very nice couple selling very nice pictures and a very good book all round the network. They embody the spirit of the canals, using the system as it should be, travelling round making and selling stuff, with a friendly face taking your money off you.” John Williamson“Colin and Carole Warring from the Wool Boat sell commercial and indie yarn and dyed yarn, and are generally all round good eggs. In a pretty competitive market they endeavour to bring people together. Their boat reaches people who knit in far-flung communities and they champion English wool.” Cathy Wright, Ormskirk“Floating repairs is a mystical mechanical trip of bicycle bliss with long-legged Sammy making frames soldered in heaven. Makes a good cuppa too while you’re waiting for your ride to be repaired.” Imogen“The Oakcake boat is on the Trent and Mersey canal, opposite a local wildlife area known as Westport Lake. It serves fabulous Staffordshire oatcakes filled with cheese and bacon, plus tea and coffee. This place is a local institution and is very popular along this stretch of the canal. Also moors near Stoke City’s Bet365 stadium on match days. It serves the best oatcakes, our local delicacy that resembles a pancake but is made with oatmeal and is savoury rather than sweet.

All that is lacking is the political willFifty years ago the country had a fairly stable housing system. The need for secure, affordable housing of the middle class was largely met through homeownership, and that of the working class through widely available social housing. But a reliance on the private market to deliver homes since the 1980s, and the loss of millions of social homes over recent decades, has destroyed this system.In the 1980s, after moving to a new town, my parents left their council house and bought a home. They were able to do this because the historic link between house prices and local incomes – between three and four times average annual income – was still intact. For my generation, both sides of this move are almost unfathomable. Social housing for young people without children? Homeownership in your 20s? Impossible.When I first moved to London in the early 2010s I spent years paying well over half of my income in rent. Even now, as my income has grown and my employment has become more secure, homeownership remains out of the question: house prices are 14.5 times the average income in London.When it comes to housing, class intersects with the intergenerational ide, as well as race and gender. Only those whose parents have sufficient money to pay their deposit can access homes to buy, leaving most of the rest of us trapped in the insecure, unaffordable private rented sector.But it needn’t be this way. The housing crisis is the result of policy choices that could be undone in less than a generation. If the government implemented policies that prioritised the provision of secure, affordable housing for everyone – regardless of age, class, race or gender – in just 10 years’ time young people’s housing options could look radically different, and a lot more hopeful. With 200,000 social homes built per year for the last decade, and the right to buy halted, the social housing deficit – estimated by Shelter in 2019 to be 3.2m homes – is well on its way to being met in a decade’s time. For young people and the working class, social housing is once again becoming the norm, providing secure, affordable housing outside of homeownership.Targeted initially at those whose needs were most radically unmet by the old system – homeless people and those living in temporary or overcrowded accommodation – as the stock of new social housing has increased, access has been broadened. For many young people, key workers and other middle-income earners social housing – architecturally attractive, and delivered as part of the Green New Deal to carbon-neutral standards – is becoming their chosen option, either for the long term, or while they save for a deposit.The old private rented sector, created in 1988, was designed primarily to attract investment, and was among the most unaffordable and insecure in Europe. But since its overhaul in 2019, bringing the sector in line with many European norms with the introduction of open-ended “lifetime” tenancies and rent controls, standards have significantly increased.For young people not yet able to access homeownership or social housing, private renting now provides a more secure and affordable alternative. The size of the sector has shrunk though, as the need for it has lessened, with many of the former private rented homes having been bought and converted to social housing.Over the decade to 2029 house prices steadily decreased, slowly bringing homeownership back within reach of many young people.The increased social housing stock reduced the demand for private housing, and helped bring prices down. At the same time, much of the “unhealthy” demand for homes – demand from investors, as opposed to demand from people who needed somewhere to live – disappeared from the housing market, reducing the competition for homes, and so lowering prices. With increased security and affordability in the private rented sector, targeted taxation on housing-as-assets, the clamping down on offshore ownership, and a bolstered pension system, investors – big and small – have become less interested in housing as an investment, with more affordable house prices the result.Alongside this, increased public and community ownership of land – through a People’s Land Trust – have taken much land and housing outside of the free market, with the memory of the decades-long mistaken reliance on the private market to meet our housing need still looming large. Homes in 2029 are once again valued as places to live, and not primarily as assets, and young people are increasingly finding themselves able to access homeownership irrespective of their parents’ wealth.In 2019, this might sound utopian. But with sufficient political will, it’s eminently achievable.• Joe Beswick is head of housing and land at the New Economics Foundation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/337eaf9a4fb14debb282f6fea9f395e09e93c86d/0_272_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4198bcbc66e0230895a904deb7b5521a","title":"the guardian view on no deal planning stop this political lie","story":"Brexit is both a political and an economic choice. But a no-deal Brexit would be an entirely political one. Boris Johnson’s blustering openness to no-deal derives from many things. Partly it stems from the fact that, to the keenest leavers, Brexit has always been an article of belief rather a policy programme. Partly it derives from the fear that only a decisive break will puncture the threat from the nationalist Brexit party. Partly it follows from the fact that he and many like him do not ultimately care about the Northern Ireland peace process, and are not bothered about the concerns of the devolved nations either. In the end, however, a no-deal Brexit is an act of faith-based politics and not a rational choice.It would also have very serious and perhaps destructive economic consequences. Some of those are becoming clearer by the day in response to the Johnson government’s prioritisation of politics. The most instantly destabilising is the fall in the value of the pound, which has dropped from $1.26 a month ago to just above $1.20 on Thursday. This puts the exchange rate within a whisker of the lowest for two and a half years and in sight of the depth to which it plunged just after the Brexit vote. But this is not a controlled devaluation. It is a freefall one. It benefits other economies without empowering ours. If a Labour government was doing this, it would be crucified for its incompetence.Even more disturbing is the decline in business investment. No-deal Brexit preparations are not the sole reason for capital’s institutional caution. International trade disputes and downturns also feed into an uncertain atmosphere. But the no-deal possibility does nothing except reinforce the mood. The result is a downward spiral of deferred decisions, stockpiled goods, declining output and avoidance of research outlay and product development. Output has fallen for the first time since the financial crisis, says the CBI. The car industry, still a major UK employer, has been particularly hard hit. Vauxhall this week said it may close its Ellesmere Port plant. BMW’s warnings show that a similar move may be imminent at Cowley.Unsurprisingly, the Bank of England said on Thursday that the risk of recession is growing, even before an actual no-deal takes place. The UK has already pencilled in zero growth in the second quarter. It would be a surprise if the third showed a better result. On the Bank’s estimates, 2019 will show the weakest UK growth since 2009 – even with EU membership – and it will be declining by the start of 2020. The Bank continues to stick to the official government message that a smooth Brexit deal is still expected. But even it acknowledges that with no-deal, the exchange rate will weaken further, inflation will rise and growth will slow even more for at least the next year.A rational policymaker would therefore be seeking ways of avoiding no-deal rather than feeding expectations that it will happen. The Johnson government, though, has ramped up the rhetoric and pumped in another £2.1bn in public money, not least on its own propaganda. Some of its commitments – like the pledge to buy UK lamb to protect hill-farmers – seem to have been made up on the spur of the moment. Others, like the disgraceful relabelling of the Irish backstop as anti-democratic, when it is not, are lies designed to mislead the public. For a government to say it does not want something to happen because it would be so damaging and then to spend so much of its money and its political capital on the possibility that it will is a shameful strategy. Nothing matters more in British politics right now than that MPs use every weapon to prevent a no-deal exit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c125080443d071a2e6a07b883548cdca6582fd46/0_0_941_574/master/941.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7462789c24eea3f6b638d90eb087a427 645w","title":"fossil fuel subsidy cash pay green energy transition","story":"Redirecting small portion of subsidies would unleash clean energy revolution, says reportSwitching just some of the huge subsidies supporting fossil fuels to renewables would unleash a runaway clean energy revolution, according to a new report, significantly cutting the carbon emissions that are driving the climate crisis.Ending fossil fuel subsidies has long been seen as vital to tackling the climate emergency, with the G20 nations pledging in 2009 to phase them out, but progress has been limited. In May, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, attacked subsidies, saying: “What we are doing is using taxpayers’ money – which means our money – to boost hurricanes, to spread droughts, to melt glaciers, to bleach corals. In one word: to destroy the world.”The new analysis shows how redirecting some of the fossil fuel subsidies could decisively tip the balance in favour of green energy, making it the cheapest electricity available and instigating a rapid global rollout.The transition from polluting fossil fuels to clean energy is already under way. Annual investment in renewables has been greater than that in fossil fuel electricity generation since 2008 and new renewable capacity has exceeded fossil fuel power each year since 2014.But progress is slow compared with the urgency required, said Bridle. “There is no question that renewables can power the energy system,” he said. “The question now is can we transition quickly enough away from fuels like coal, and subsidy reform is a very obvious step towards that.” Very few ways of cutting emissions actually save governments money, he said.“Taking away subsidies from fossil fuels and channelling them towards clean energy would boost their development at a much faster pace, and help secure our climate goals,” said Ipek Gençsü of the Overseas Development Institute. An added bonus is the social and economic benefits, such as reduced air pollution and health spending, she said.Most experts define fossil fuel subsidies as financial or tax support for those buying fuel or the companies producing it. The IMF also includes the cost of the damage fossil fuel burning causes to climate and health, leading to an estimate of $5.2tn of fossil fuel subsidies in 2017, or $10m a minute. Ending the subsidies would cut global emissions by about a quarter, the IMF estimates, and halve the number of early deaths from fossil fuel air pollution.Bridle said funding fossil fuel subsidies was “madness”, but said ending them could cause short-term price rises and political difficulties, as the benefits of lower costs in the future and reduced air pollution are less obvious.“There are political problems but it is worth persevering because the prize is so big,” he said. “You have to bring people along with you.” Gençsü said governments must ensure that the most vulnerable people were not adversely affected by changes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/011cdcafce21a4bba2c459b6e1d1ddf0d6f82dc0/76_377_2429_1458/master/2429.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=096575d9450184573841377937d12f23","title":"slow fashion how to keep your favourite clothes for ever from laundering to moth proofing","story":"Extending the life of your wardrobe is good for the planet and your finances. Experts give their tips on how to make your outfits last as long as possibleUnless you plan to wear a suit of armour for the rest of your life, there is no way to make your clothes last for ever. You can get close to for ever – if you are prepared to darn. As a society, though, we have become less inclined to make do and mend because the advent of fast fashion has made clothes so affordable that there is no incentive to repair them. In addition, the acceleration of trends – where once there were just two seasons, autumnwinter and springsummer, now there are also resort, cruise and pre-fall collections – means consumers are continually enticed to buy new things. It is estimated that, in the UK, the average lifetime for an item of clothing is 2.2 years.Extending the life of our clothes isn’t just good for our finances, but also benefits the environment: the fashion industry is a major global polluter and human rights abuses are rife in the garment industries of developing nations.Not so long ago, people learned basic sewing skills. The chances are that, if you ask an older friend or relative, they will be able to show you how to patch things. And there is no doubt that, if you want your clothes to last as long as possible, looking after them is the best place to start. But how do you make your clothes last for ever? We asked some experts.It sounds obvious, but if you want your clothes to last, you need to invest in well-made garments in good-quality fabric. Don’t assume that expensive items are best – check for yourself.“The first thing to do when you’re looking at a piece of clothing is turn it inside out and pull at every piece of string you find,” says Orsola de Castro of Fashion Revolution. “When clothes are cheaply made, the seams are often shabby. If it starts to unravel – don’t buy it.”She suggests making sure the seam allowance on a pair of trousers or a skirt is enough to allow you to let them out and the hem is such that you could make the garment longer if you need to. She also advises checking that shirts have a spare button sewn in so if one falls off, you have a replacement.Vintage clothing expert Amy Winston-Hart of Amy’s Vintage says you should hold garments up to the light: “If you can see light coming through the fabric, it’s going to go quickly.”Every garment will eventually wear out after repeated wearing and washing, but the jury is out on which fabrics are the most durable. Some experts prefer the longevity of synthetic fibres such as polyester, while others favour natural fibres such as cotton.Charles Ross, sustainability expert and lecturer at the Royal College of Art says: “I prefer wearing synthetics because I believe they are more durable fibres. If you have two identical T-shirts in cotton or polyester, the cotton will wear out quicker.” The more you wash clothes, the quicker they wear out. De Castro echoes Stella McCartney’s recent advice that we should refrain from over-cleaning clothes. “If something is made from good-quality wool, such as a man’s suit, it’s designed to be brushed clean and not washed,” she says. If you must wash things in a machine, use a low heat, and put delicate fabrics in a laundry bag to reduce tearing.There are plenty of ways to refresh clothes without bunging them in the machine: De Castro suggests spot-cleaning tricky stains, or taking whiffy garments into the bathroom while you shower, to steam them. This will not only help to make your clothes last longer, but is also more environmentally friendly. The average washing machine uses 13,500 gallons of water a year, as much as you drink in your lifetime.Winston-Hart has some nifty tricks for cleaning items without putting them in the machine. “A mixture of lukewarm water and vodka will get rid of smells,” she says. Use three parts vodka and two parts water if something is very stinky, or three parts water and two parts vodka if it only has a light musk. “Stick the mixture in a spray bottle and mist it over. If your clothing still smells bad the next day, give it another spray.” She is also a fan of popping clothes in the freezer, for an overnight refresh. If things are still pongy, hang them out on the line on a breezy day – you will be surprised by how much it can help.None of the experts I speak to are fans of dry cleaning, although they accept it is sometimes necessary. “Dry cleaning doesn’t always clean stuff that well,” says Winston-Hart. “Sometimes it comes back smelling worse – that chemical smell.” By looking after your clothes as much as possible, you can cut back on dry cleaning.An important caveat: items worn close to your skin, particularly underwear and socks, should be washed at an adequate heat. Don’t fling pants in with your dish towels on a 30C wash. “You really don’t want to put bedding, tea towels, gym kit, underwear and socks in at a low temperature,” says environmental health practitioner Dr Lisa Ackerley. All need to be washed at a minimum of 60C.If you are worried about ruining your underwear, wash it at a lower temperature, but add an antibacterial cleanser to the wash.Katrina Hassan, a professional organiser, recommends periodically decluttering your wardrobe. “Get all your clothing in one space – I call it the power of the pile. A lot of people aren’t aware of all the things they own, until they see it.”Decide which items to keep, and check them over for damage. Store things properly – Hassan teaches clients how to fold clothes, then stack them in an upright position, so you can see everything you own at once. “When you store things vertically, you’re less tempted to buy things, and more conscious with your consumerism … you know exactly what you own, and where it’s stored.”Store expensive items in cotton suit bags to prevent moth damage. (If you are on a budget, Winston-Hart suggests using an old single bedsheet, cutting a hole in it for a coathanger to poke through, then sewing up the sides for a DIY suit bag.)To get the most out of your footwear, ensure you look after the leather. “I tend to wear Timberland boots,” Ross tells me, “and every six weeks I wash off the dirt and put on a leather conditioner to keep them going for longer.” (He favours a brand called Nikwax.)It is not just footwear that you can treat to make it last longer: brands such as Polygiene use silver chloride technology, which is antimicrobial, to put a finish on fabrics. “If you have the finish on a polyester T-shirt, you can wear it for five years before it starts smelling,” claims Ross.“I have a deep relationship with my local tailor,” says De Castro. Once a year, she sorts through all her items, and then takes them in for repairs. “They’ll fix niggly things such as dropped hems, change the zips on evening gowns, or take things in and let them out.” When a pair of shoes starts to wear out, consider whether they can be resoled. Ross has worn the same pair of outdoor boots since 1985: the soles have been replaced six times.It is easy to do basic repairs yourself. “If you want to start repairing things and you’re not sure how to go about it, try out on some scrap fabric first,” says repairs expect Tom van Deijnen of the Visible Mending Programme. He recommends watching YouTube videos to learn basic skills, and asking family and friends for help. “In my experience, mothers and grandmothers always come up trumps,” he says.With worn-out jeans, Van Deijnen recommends sewing on patches. “Use a similar colour fabric, in the same weight as the original material – if it’s a woven fabric, patch it with a woven fabric, and if it’s a jersey fabric, use a jersey patch.”A common mistake people make when darning knitwear is to do it too tightly. “It doesn’t leave room for shrinking – sometimes threads can shrink when they are new. And if you pull the hole too tight, it can also cause a pucker, which creates tension in the fabric, meaning it will rip again.”Van Deijnen explains the best way to sew on a button. “Thread the needle, make some stitches in the fabric, then attach the button and sew it on. Do it a good few times. When you’ve finished, tug on the thread. If it comes loose, you didn’t do a good job.”Not every item can be repaired. “I’m quite adventurous and I’ll always give things ago, but sometimes things can be completely beyond repair,” says Van Deijnen. He recently had to bin a knitted tie that was riddled with moth eggs. The fabric disintegrated in his hands when he touched it, so he had no choice.When something can’t be fixed, think of alternate uses for it. “Everything can have another function at the end of its life,” says De Castro. She cuts up old swimsuits to use as hair ties (old tights are also good for this). And old T-shirts make the best cleaning rags.Donate intelligently. “Charity shops are brimming with our clothes,” says De Castro, “so you should only donate to charity what you think will sell. Otherwise, you’re dumping your problem on another organisation.” If you know it won’t sell – perhaps because it is old gym kit – take it to a textile-recycling bank where it can be turned into a new item. (Trainers can be recycled at branches of Runners Need.) The Love Your Clothes campaign has a textile bank locator, along with other resources, on its website.If you want your clothes to last, it can make sense to buy vintage: things made before 1980 tend to be made to a higher standard than modern items. “Even cheaply made 1970s trousers, if you turn them inside out, will resemble couture now,” says De Castro. But there is also a lot of factory-made fake vintage out there. How to tell? Look at details such as zips – is there a hook and eye to keep the zip in place? If not, it may be a fake. Other signs include 40s-style dresses with elasticated fabric – stretchy material wasn’t around then.Look after your vintage. “Armpit shields are really good,” says Winston-Hart. “They’re just cotton half-moons you attach with safety pins to your clothing under the armpits. You remove the pins and wash the pads themselves – which saves you having to wash the garment all the time.”Wearing a slip under a skirt means you don’t have to clean the skirt as often, as it is not touching your skin, cutting down on dry cleaning costs and reducing wear. If the slip is made out of silk, it will also help to regulate your body temperature. There are so many places to find secondhand treasures, whether it is a clothes swap with friends, charity shops or car boot sales. If you are a vintage aficionado, Winston-Hart recommends her favourite stores: Apple Tree Vintage, 1940s Style For You, Scarlet Rage Vintage, Blackout Vintage Fashion and Hunky Dory Vintage. (Many have online stores.) If vintage isn’t your thing, find more contemporary secondhand pieces on eBay or Depop. Sometimes, buying new clothes can be a sustainable choice – Hiut Denim will do free repairs on your jeans for life.It is not just about buying vintage or secondhand clothes. Ross talks about “emotional durability,” or the attachment to our most beloved clothes, because the most sustainable item in your wardrobe isn’t always the one that is ethically produced from non-polluting fabrics. It is the one you love, and will wear your whole life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74ccbae5fc23c17f07dbf696984c34f967050ed1/0_77_2496_1498/master/2496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73a8df9a8f5202ab41a69d999a47984f","title":"premier league 201920 preview no 8 everton","story":"Marco Silva has foundations to build on and after some shrewd signings should be aiming for Europa League qualification writers’ predicted position: 8th (NB: this is not necessarily Andy Hunter’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 150-1Grand designs for Everton’s proposed stadium have been unveiled 30 months after Bramley Moore dock was identified as the club’s preferred site and decades after the search for a new home began. Now it is a matter of securing planning permission, £500m of funding and overcoming Unesco world heritage concerns over a derelict location before construction can start on Farhad Moshiri’s plans for Everton’s future. In the meantime, the billionaire majority shareholder will expect to see progress on his substantial investment in Everton’s present. That too is overdue after several false starts.Unlike the stadium impressively envisaged by the architect Dan Meis, the manager Marco Silva has foundations to build on. For a sizeable chunk of last season – the three months bookended by the two Merseyside derbies, more or less – Silva appeared at risk of joining Sam Allardyce and Ronald Koeman on a lengthy list of poor appointments made on Moshiri’s watch. On this occasion the craving for stability, the appreciation of the mess Silva inherited and the desire to avoid another expensive managerial change prevailed. Everton were rewarded with a highly impressive finish to the manager’s debut campaign, one that not only showed his methods taking root but helped improve the fractured relationship between crowd and team. They have something to build on together.“The feeling of our fans and players enjoying what we are doing is everything I want as a manager,” Silva said after Everton’s humiliation of Manchester United in April. He elaborated: “Good goals, quality, solid without the ball and we kept pressing them high and never give them a chance to feel comfortable. We gave a quiet afternoon for our goalkeeper too.”That 4-0 lesson at Goodison Park, Everton’s biggest win over United in 35 years, was undoubtedly the high point of the season but not an isolated performance during the run-in. Everton won five of their final eight matches, keeping six clean sheets, including home victories against Chelsea, Arsenal and Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s sorry side. Of the starting XI against United the influential Idrissa Gueye and Kurt Zouma are no longer on Everton’s books, although Silva has not abandoned all hope of re-signing the Chelsea defender on a permanent basis. Gueye is a significant loss, having got his head down and flourished last season when others would have sulked after being denied a dream January move to Paris Saint-Germain.Both need replacing in what may prove a hectic end to the transfer window – with Mainz’s Jean-Philippe Gbamin earmarked as Gueye’s successor – and yet there is greater stability within the Everton squad than for several years. With United and Arsenal vulnerable, to say the least, Silva’s side are among those who see Europa League qualification and bridging the gap to the top six as achievable targets. Ending a trophy drought that has reached 24 years – the joint-longest in the club’s history (and the second world war was a factor in the other) – is also on the manager’s bonus list. As the imminent deal for the Juventus striker Moise Kean and £50m-plus bid for Wilfried Zaha confirm, there is work to be done beyond filling the gaps left by Zouma and Gueye.Everton ended last season strongly but an upturn that began with a committed draw against Liverpool in March, the last point taken from Jürgen Klopp’s challengers during the title race, was not without lapses. Silva’s side have some way to go to convince consistently. Their form nose-ed in December after Jordan Pickford’s error gifted Liverpool an injury-time winner at Anfield. That illustrated a recurring problem that drove the manager to distraction – the team’s tendency to lose focus andor confidence following a bad mistake or when conceding a goal against the run of play. A soft touch, in other words, which partly explains Everton’s move for an experienced title winner in Fabian Delph. The 29-year-old does not fit the transfer profile outlined by the director of football, Marcel Brands, who ideally wants to invest in players aged between 20 and 2526, but he was always prepared to make exceptions that represent good value. At an initial £8.5m from Manchester City, the England international fits that bill.Re-signing André Gomes on a permanent deal from Barcelona was a priority for Silva and accomplished for £22m plus a minimum of fuss. The manager will be looking to his compatriot to bring more leadership and not only shine when the going is good. Silva also wants to sign competition for Séamus Coleman at right back – most likely a loan – while the Italy international Kean represents the latest attempt to solve a longstanding problem in Everton’s attack. At 19, the Juventus academy product can not guarantee consistency in front of goal but he is an exciting, intriguing capture that reflects the club’s desire to build long term. He also eases the burden on Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who thrived with the backing of Silva and the crowd during a much-needed run at centre-forward last season but is the first to admit his finishing must improve.Silva, now assisted by the former Arsenal and Fulham striker Luís Boa Morte, believes Everton can compete for the top six with a few key additions. He oversaw a vast improvement in Gylfi Sigurdsson, Michael Keane and Calvert-Lewin last season while, with the exception of Yerry Mina, every signing made last summer enhanced the side. But another eighth-placed finish was not what Silva, Brands, Moshiri, Lucas Digne, Richarlison, Bernard and others signed up for. It is time to push on, both on the pitch and on the dock."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/906a9c4b6437995483261cb1bc46cb2bca885b67/0_161_4887_2932/master/4887.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8da9e0536bf48a7ab6f0523a4404db86","title":"the mans taken the big stick to po fiver pow thwack","story":"Sign up now!

So today’s Fiver has been cancelled.So then, those exciting Aston Villa signings. First up, the pride of all Birmingham completed the capture of Tom Heaton from the England goalkeeper training academy in Burnley for a fee of whatever and then they announced the signing from Club Brugge of the Zimbabwe international midfielder Mavelous Nakamba, an ideal replacement for Super Glenn Whelan. “He’s very mobile, he’s very good in possession and he will fit in with our style of play,” rejoiced Villa ringmaster Dean Smith.For the sake of easy puns the Fiver was hoping Villa had also recruited some of Nakamba’s international teammates, such as Knowledge Musona and Godknows Murwira, but it turns out that those two are among the few footballers yet to be hired by Villa this summer. But there’s a week left until the transfer window closes, so there’s plenty of time.Smith, once a pupil at the Brentford School of Moneyballing, has already taken his spree beyond £140m on 12 players.

As well as “changing aspirations” she said education and expectations were among the possible reasons for fewer teenagers having babies.“There’s been government legislation which means the school leaving age has increased to 18. There’s also been significant improvements in the availability of emergency and long-acting contraception,” she said.Berrington added that she thought people in their 20s and 30s were more likely to postpone having children because of practical factors such as the lack of affordable housing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa1e5abc6629b7933ba348ba37c138475b1a7839/0_0_2283_1370/master/2283.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b32c549f1e2a2388d46a70aa22888bbb","title":"can cardi b and bernie sanders save politics love island","story":"Everyone wants to encourage young people to vote. But getting a rapper and a senator together in a nail salon may not be the way to do itI am ever more convinced that the only celebrity we need right now is the Bronx rapper Cardi B, who represents most clearly the duality of man in everything she says and does, a complex spectrum of humanity that seems most electrifyingly united in the body and soul of a 26-year-old who is sort of married to one of the hip-hop group Migos. On the one hand, nobody on Earth has danced in a way that, as per the Thotiana remix video, I saw it and immediately had to go home early from work on the other hand, I don’t think there is a single other pop star alive who can coldly cite the names and works of every US president then meet up with a Democratic candidate in a nail salon while wearing a $9,000 dress. We talk a lot about “icons”, don’t we, but I’m starting to think the word is a blunt tool, ineffective at piercing the sheer diamond of Cardi B. We must expand the language to encompass her.Anyway, the meeting. This week Cardi joined Senator Bernie Sanders in Detroit to talk about the potential of “economic, racial and social justice for all” (according to the Instagram post about their meeting) and to record one of those outreach videos aimed at young people to get them to vote and which never, ever work.This happens like clockwork once every four years, to be fair. Who will be our celebrity presidential outreach in 2023? Will the Stranger Things kids still be a thing, or will a rush of puberty have made them wonky and unlikable? Will JoJo Siwa still be about or will a younger, even more cheerful YouTuber have risen up and drunk the blood straight out of her veins? There are more famous children now than at any time in history. This paragraph could have gone on for ever.I reckon the meeting is broadly a good thing. US politics is, of course, a war zone – a scheduled Cardi B concert was cancelled in Indianapolis the day after the Instagram post went up, due to an “unverified threat”, and it’s not a great stretch to imagine someone with just slightly too many bumper stickers on their car deciding to call something in after learning the singer leaned left – and you can understand why the bigger pop stars tend to shy away from it. Taylor Swift, of course – enigmatic siren, platinum-selling artist, potentially the first singer to ever medically transform herself into a cat – remained tight-lipped about her own politics throughout the “Hillary yas!” era of 2016, only breaking omertà and using Instagram to endorse two Democratic candidates in late 2018 (which, predictably, resulted in outrage). To be fair: if my career was predicated on keeping angry people happy enough to stream Apple Music so I can pay for a mansion, I would probably avoid coming down too hard on the side of human rights, too.Still, I have a troubling vision of this becoming a trend in British politics, which we can all agree is “just like American politics, but worse”. Leading pop stars doing serious-face in the direction of cool young-buck MPs in a deliberately chosen chic-but-casual venue is absolutely not what we need when we are staring down the barrel of No Deal, but I fear that’s not going to stop any of them anyway. Ed Sheeran lo-fiving Chuka Umunna in a Morley’s. Harry Styles teaching Caroline Lucas to longboard. Jess Phillips at-replying Stormzy until she is blocked on Twitter and Instagram. And then you slide down the ladders of glamour: Mike Gapes taking a baffled Lemar from Fame Academy out for a Harvester. Rak-Su Do Not Understand What Jacob Rees-Mogg Wants With Them But They’re Scared He Is A Vampire So They’re Going Along With It Anyway. Nigel Farage and Steve Brookstein sharing a warm, silent pint. As soon as British MPs twig that it’s easier to get young people onside by sitting quite near to their favourite pop stars instead of – I don’t know – actually endorsing policy that makes life easier and better for them, then we are all screwed. All it takes is one stern word from Charli XCX and we could have national service back again. Pray our pop overgods are merciful ones.That is, perhaps, unfair, but the post-Island interest in islanders is similar to that feeling of hollow, distracted emptiness you have (you, not me! I don’t do that sort of thing!) when you have been looking at porn for too long – fine for a while, but then suddenly you zoom out behind yourself and see what you are doing, and feel grim and a little bit ashamed. (I have been watching Curtis Pritchard for two months! Close the tab!) Now that they have all been given their phones back, had them buzz hot for two hours with notifications and gone through the absolute carnage of their Instagram “Other” folder, they are all primed and ready to re-enter actual, real life, armed with nothing but tender little doomed relationships, about £200,000-worth of scheduled sponcon and a 40-date tour of nightclubs in Britain’s satellite towns.

Tommy Fury will make a baffled appearance on A League of Their Own, then box someone’s head in to one of the most curious crowds the O2 has ever seen, where the usual audience of cubicle-dwelling, cash-in-hand hard dads will nestle shoulder-to-shoulder with screaming teenage girls, wine-drunk on rosé.Nobody will ever hear from Jordan again. Amber will thrive outside the villa, but Greg will not. Ovie deserves his own ITV2 show but will nobly decide he doesn’t want it.

They want pleasant, well-maintained facilities with good-quality food choices.“Motorway services continue to play an important safety role providing drivers with the opportunity to take a break. Drivers confirm they feel less stressed and are more alert after stopping at motorway services.”Severn View services, owned by operator Moto, is one of the smallest motorway services in the network. It has attracted a swathe of critical Google reviews one user claimed it was “tired and overdue a refit” and another that the restaurant had “flies buzzing about”. Other reviewers described the toilet facilities as “grim”, “falling apart” and “dismal”.“However, we will be redoubling our efforts in the year ahead to improve the services on offer at Severn View and expect to see a similar significant improvement to the one we achieved at Thurrock last year.”Luke Bosdet, an AA spokesman, said: “Motorway service areas have long faced an image battle with the motorists that use them. On one hand, they are a godsend for toilet breaks, relief from monotonous hours on the motorway and the chance for a nap or wake-up coffee. On the other, the sheer numbers that use them during the summer and the strain that can put on the service area facilities can leave drivers with a poor impression.”Top five (Name and location, operator and customer satisfaction rating)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39a2c1874e4003e7233212f66fd0c25d88fc730f/0_220_6593_3956/master/6593.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=913d9b588aadc2352798fa0dc72d3b20","title":"fatou seidi ghali the worlds first female tuareg guitarist","story":"Fatou Seidi Ghali once had to practise on her brother’s guitar in secret. She and her band, Les Filles de Illighadad, are now taking the world by stormLes Filles de Illighadad are in their dressing room, listening to music on their phones and scrolling through social media apps. Fatou Seidi Ghali, the band’s lead guitarist and singer, leans in to show me a Snapchat she has just received from a friend: in a hilly desert, a white-robed man is riding a horse at full speed. He tries to stand up in the saddle and falls off into a plume of sand. Fatou looks up at me, laughing.The group are from a small village called Illighadad in the Tuareg region of the Sahara in western Niger. While the region has produced some celebrated guitarists, acts such as Bombino, Mdou Moctar and Tinariwen’s Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, Fatou is the first ever Tuareg woman to play guitar professionally.She started the band in 2016 with her cousin Alamnou Akrouni, who plays percussion and sings. A third member, Mariama Salah Aswan, recently left to start a family and was replaced by Fatimata Ahmadelher, the Tuareg’s second-ever female guitarist, who also contributes vocals and percussion. They are in their late 20s, they say, although they have no birth certificates. Fatou’s brother, Abdoulaye Madassane, joins them on tour, providing rhythm guitar.Another brother, Ahmoudou, introduced Fatou to the instrument, albeit inadvertently, when he brought one home from Libya. Fatou, aged about 10, began teaching herself to play in secret, sneaking off to practise every time her brother was out. The sight of a woman holding the guitar was in itself controversial. “My father told me to stop wasting my time,” says Fatou, talking through an interpreter. “I should be busy looking after the cows.” But she persisted, and people began to take notice.Among them was Christopher Kirkley, a music fan from Portland, Oregon, who started the record label Sahel Sounds in 2010 as a way of bringing south-Saharan music to a wider audience. He had heard about Fatou playing guitar at weddings, and managed to track her down. After hearing her play at home in the village, Kirkley recorded Les Filles’ eponymous first album, with Alamnou playing tende, a traditional Tuareg goatskin drum, and Fatou playing fingerpicked blues on an acoustic guitar. They play folksongs they have known all their lives – love songs and odes to nomadic life – with the sound of local people laughing and singing along in the background.Tende music, named after the drum, is played at traditional Tuareg courting rituals, where all the women in a village sing to each other in a call-and-response style. As they sing, men approach on camelback, trying to catch the eye of a potential suitor while the camels’ hooves move in time with the music.How important is music to the Tuareg? This question elicits quizzical looks. “Everyone listens. Everyone plays,” says Fatimata.“For love, for pain, for enjoyment,” adds Abdoulaye. “When there is tension in the village, musicians come to calm everyone down.” Different occasions require different kinds of music, tende being one and takamba, a faster style built around a three- or four-stringed loot instrument known as the ngoni, is another, often played at weddings.Fatou played the ngoni before she ever picked up a guitar. She created Les Filles’ sound by combining these influences – tende, takamba and hausa music, a folk style from Nigeria. The band’s success means she is treated “like a queen” when she returns home, with local people asking for photos and offering motorcycle lifts wherever she goes. She is modest when I ask what she hopes to achieve with her band: “Helping the village, buying medicines, supporting my brothers and sisters.”We meet shortly after their performance at the Womad festival, and Fatou and Fatimata are arguing heatedly in Tamasheq, their native tongue. The gig didn’t go well, at least not in their view. The sound engineers struggled with the calabash – a pumpkin-like fruit cut in half and partly submerged in water, drummed to mimic camels’ hooves – and the band had to swap instruments a few times to try to get rid of the feedback. The crowd was enraptured nonetheless.Like the , Womad recently removed “world music” from its lexicon to avoid the inadequacy of grouping together hundreds of geographically disparate genres. The festival’s name recalls another term that may be more fitting for Les Filles: “nomad” is a tag worn proudly by the Sahara-roaming Tuareg people, and an equivalent Tamasheq word, amahegh, meaning a Tuareg of noble heart, translates as “free man”. As they continue on a world tour that has already taken them to Australia, Israel, Sweden and Canada, Les Filles are giving the words new meaning.Les Filles de Illighadad’s world tour continues. Their second album, Eghass Malan (Sahel Sounds), is out now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df23da3b1559172ff8e6b41e776b2040677cd453/0_302_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f654751ac775a0f618509ef69e30fadb","title":"mabel high expectations review","story":"(Polydor)On her undeniably hit-making debut, the daughter of Neneh Cherry sings ‘I’m not a people pleaser’ over backings intent on pleasing as many as possibleThe title of Mabel McVey’s debut album seems less like an expression of thrusting youthful ambition than a statement of fact. High Expectations arrives with her current single Mad Love just outside the Top 10, and its predecessor, Don’t Call Me Up, still lurking around the charts a full six months after its release. Excited voices are calling her the next Dua Lipa, which sounds like faint praise – with the greatest of respect, it doesn’t quite have the hyperbolic cachet of the next Dylan or the next Madonna – until you realise that Dua Lipa is basically the only British pop artist who isn’t Ed Sheeran to have broken America in eons. They don’t want our rappers, however much Drake tries to convince them otherwise they evince no interest in our massed ranks of earnest post-Sheeran acoustic troubadours, but it’s multiplatinum hits and million-selling albums up the wazoo for the New Rules singer.From the outside at least, McVey’s path to this point has seemed remarkably smooth: the first song she posted to SoundCloud in 2015 ended up being played on Radio 1 and securing her a major label deal three of her subsequent singles went platinum. Don’t Call Me Up has been a hit not just in the UK but the US, hence the Dua Lipa comparisons. So smooth, in fact, that McVey has been at pains to point out that nepotism has nothing to do with it. She certainly comes from hip music industry stock – her mum is Neneh Cherry, her father Cameron McVey was the executive producer of Massive Attack’s Blue Lines – but anyone searching for sonic evidence of her lineage on High Expectations is going to go home disappointed. It goes fangs-out for the 2019 pop jugular, with a host of familiar names on hand to help ensure its success is as much of a foregone conclusion as possible: Steve Mac, whose hit-making career stretches back to mid-90s boybands Damage and 5ive and whose recent songwriting successes include Ed Sheeran’s Shape of You and Clean Bandit’s Rockabye and Symphony Fraser T Smith of Adele and Stormzy fame MNEK, co-author of Dua Lipa’s IDGAF among others and Jimmy Napes, whose fingerprints are on huge chunks of both Sam Smith albums.On the plus side, that helps ensure the songs are uniformly well turned. There’s a certain bullish confidence about the fact that most of McVey’s previous hits are confined to bonus-track status, and if nothing leaps out in quite the same way as Don’t Call Me Up, nor is there much in the way of obvious filler: there’s a lot of hooky razzle-dazzle about the choruses of Bad Behaviour and Selfish Love it’s no stretch of the imagination to picture even the relatively low-key We Don’t Say or Trouble taking up residence in the Top 40. In the debit column, however, playlist-fuelled 2019 pop prizes a certain homogeneity: a scan of the singles chart over the 27 weeks that Don’t Call Me Up has been hanging around strongly suggests that no mainstream pop artist other than Lil Nas X is currently making it big as a result of their devastating originality and penchant for recklessly tearing up the rules. There’s a weird disjunction between McVey’s lyrics, which are big on telling you what a caution-to-the-winds handful she is, and the music that supports them, which sticks pretty fast to the well-made pop-R\u0026ampB playbook: “I’m not a people pleaser,” she sings on Bad Behaviour, over a backing that’s clearly intent on pleasing as many people as possible.High Expectations could use a couple more moments like that, although it probably doesn’t need them to be a huge success: it’s got the big killer pop hit and a tracklist thick with potential follow-ups. As it is, you’re left with a solid, well-made pop album that occasionally hints its maker might be more interesting and inidual: time will show if that’s the case, but the immediate future seems secure.Marika Hackman: All NightAs sultry as the weather, at least at the time of writing, Hackman’s “overtly sexual song about a woman” is a small-hours gem."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c37bb9a6b2005b8f6652993517eb00f1028935a/0_813_4093_2455/master/4093.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=993e52dc6fd43c77ce7850f28b4b4022","title":"miles daviss 20 greatest albums ranked","story":"With his lost 1985 album Rubberband out in September, and the 50th anniversary of In a Silent Way – released this week – we count down the jazz icon’s finest momentsIn the end, Miles Davis would fascinate jazz, rock and classical fans alike. But in the 1940s he had been a teenage trumpet hopeful partnering Charlie Parker and by 1954, when this session was recorded, he had an understatedly personal version of the revolutionary bebop sound. Alongside Sonny Rollins and Thelonious Monk, he reveals it here.A patchily intriguing set from the next decade, flagging the ever-changing Miles’ migration from free-swinging jazz to rock. The saxophonist Wayne Shorter broods, the embryonic soul-star George Benson plays terse guitar, Herbie Hancock debuts the formerly unjazzy Fender Rhodes and Tony Williams drums up a perfect storm.Miles comprehensively burned out in 1975, but while his comeback six years later was uncertain, his 1970s edginess was now softened by the rediscovery of his early lyricism. Good originals such as Back Seat Betty, with its wistful trumpet and hard-thumbed Marcus Miller bass hooks, entered the repertoire.Marcus Miller, Miles’s 1980s svengali, scored and glossily produced this late-career set dedicated to South Africa’s liberation from apartheid. It’s a bit lightweight for its subject, but the Jaco Pastorius tribute is both swinging and soulful, and the title ballad is bittersweet acoustic Miles at his most poignant.Audacious but sympathetic remixes by imaginative producerplayer Bill Laswell, of music from Miles’s heavily experimental 1970s period, including In a Silent Way. While Laswell’s echoey, bass-pumping, beat-swelling treatments sometimes twist the originals way out of shape, their creator’s spirit runs through it all.The director Louis Malle hired a Paris-loving, 31-year-old Miles and a FrenchUS band including the bebop drummer Kenny Clarke to improvise a soundtrack for his noirish 1958 thriller L’Ascenseur Pour L’Echafaud (Lift to the Scaffold). Going only by the visuals, the trumpeter reflected the movie’s desolate romanticism perfectly.Bill Laswell, Miles’s posthumous remixer, called 1972’s On the Corner “mutant hip-hop” – others have heard dub, pre-punk, drum’n’bass and more in its oceanic, thick-textured, harmony-purged turmoil of multiple keyboards, overdubs, saxes and percussion. Long ignored, the session is on its way to rehabilitation.Miles preferred patience, tension, release and expressiveness of tone to the torrents of notes that often characterised bebop. This classy 50s compilation, including the saxophonist Jackie McLean, pianist Horace Silver and drummer Art Blakey, features both his ballad elegance and some of his most surefooted improv over a bop groove.Miles buffs refer to his “first and second great quintets”. The second was the 1960s group including Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams. This, with saxophonist John Coltrane, is the dazzling first. The contrast between the reticent, incisive trumpeter and the unquenchable Coltrane is mesmerising.In 1985, Denmark’s government awarded Miles Davis its normally classical Sonning prize, and Danish trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg wrote an orchestral suite for the star and – somehow – persuaded him to play on it. Superb solos from an engaged and attentive Miles, navigating Mikkelborg’s references to all kinds of 20th-century music.Miles’s last session for Columbia Records, notably including beautiful interpretations of two pop songs – Cyndi Lauper’s Time After Time and Michael Jackson’s Human Nature. Also striking is guitar newcomer John Scofield’s fast and convoluted title-track blues, one of the great original compositions for a late-period Miles lineup.The dense, dark, Latin-fusion epic Bitches Brew was a landmark of production as well as musicianship from a superb band including Wayne Shorter, John McLaughlin, Chick Corea and Jack DeJohnette. The players improvised for hours the producer, Teo Macero, and Miles cut-and-pasted the results into distinct tracks later.Along with Kind of Blue, Milestones is a masterpiece from the 1950s quintet including John Coltrane – expanded to a sextet here by gospel-y alto saxophonist Julian “Cannonball” Adderley. The springy, airborne title track is a standout, as is the leader’s incisive improv on Thelonious Monk’s Straight, No Chaser.Most at ease in small groups, Miles Davis was also a poetic soloist in concerto-like roles with a big band. His long and fruitful relationship with the Canadian composerarranger Gil Evans gets a spectacular airing on Spanish themes including the smouldering Concierto de Aranjuez, and the quietly conversational Solea.Maybe the best-ever representation of “the second great quintet” at work. Superbly recorded live at Chicago’s Plugged Nickel club, the set finds Miles, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams reinventing small-band jazz with an all-but-psychic flexibility of timing and on-the-fly harmonising.The young Miles wanted to play bebop’s revolutionary conceptions in a more ethereal, less impatient way than its first pioneers. With likeminded souls including saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and Lee Konitz, and the composerarranger Gil Evans, he formed this delicately groundbreaking chamber ensemble, an influence on the jazz sound still.A beautiful makeover of the Gershwin opera – give or take a little shaky section playing in the under-rehearsed band – with Miles’s trumpet soaring over a Gil Evans-arranged orchestra. His exhortations over the shouts of the band on Prayer, and his supple, gliding solo on Summertime are standouts.From a film-score assignment about boxing legend Jack Johnson, Miles launched a new band (hiring Stevie Wonder bassist Michael Henderson among others) and built a thrillingly hard-rocking sound out of long studio jams and radical editing. The seeds of his next five years are in this uncompromising music.Time stands still on this 1969 Davis classic. Electric sounds and textures (notably from new guitarist John McLaughlin and keyboardist Joe Zawinul) make clear breaks from the trumpeter’s acoustic bands – but Miles’s horn and Wayne Shorter’s keening soprano sax sketch passages of an exquisite, irresistible tranquillity.Revered by pundits and fans, radiating an enduringly contemporary sound, and with un-jazz-like sales of 4 million plus at the last count, Kind of Blue – the 1959 session recorded in just a few hours and with minimal rehearsal – changed the way listeners and practitioners everywhere heard and made music. The Milestones band, with John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley on saxes, was the core, with the graceful pianist Bill Evans added, and the use of modes rather than song chords throughout gave the music an ethereal, free-associative spaciousness that draws new audiences to jazz to this day.Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema - ranked!Michael Caine\u0027s best films - ranked!The 10 best Glenn Close movies - ranked!Tom Cruise - top 20 movies - ranked!Judi Dench - every film - ranked!Ryan Gosling movies - ranked!10 best Hugh Grant films - ranked!Nicole Kidman’s top 10 films - ranked!The best and the worst Jennifer Lopez films - ranked!All Helen Mirren\u0027s 61 movies - ranked!Robert Redford\u0027s greatest screen roles - ranked!Winona Ryder\u0027s 20 best films - ranked!Movie Santa Clauses - ranked!Jason Statham - every film - ranked!Emma Thompson\u0027s best films - ranked!Biopics trashed by families, friends and fans - ranked!Purr evil: cats in movies with hidden agendas - ranked!Dog weepie movies - ranked!Top 20 J-horror films - ranked!Movies that have grossed more than $1bn - ranked!Palme d\u0027Or winners - ranked!The scariest horror films ever - ranked!The best Shakespeare films - ranked!The 10 best movie shark performances - ranked!Worst holidays in cinema - ranked!James Bond on film – 007\u0027s best and worst movies - ranked!The 20 best Marvel films - ranked!Top 10 Merchant Ivory films - ranked!Pixar - every film ever made - ranked!Planet of the Apes - the best and worst of the movies - ranked!Star Wars - every film - ranked!The 20 best music documentaries - ranked!The weirdest Brits performances - ranked!Game of Thrones - every episode - ranked!Oscar nominees - the weirdest ever - ranked!Oscar snubs - the 20 greatest ever - ranked!The biggest Rock \u0026amp Roll Hall of Fame snubs ever - ranked!Super Bowl half-time shows - the 10 greatest - ranked!The best X Factor finalists - ranked!From Niall Horan\u0027s toast to Russell Crowe’s jockstrap: celebrity auction items - ranked!All Abba\u0027s UK singles - ranked!Every one of Madonna\u0027s 78 singles - ranked!Kate Bush – every UK single - ranked!Queen\u0027s 50 UK singles - ranked!Taylor Swift\u0027s singles - ranked!The Who: their UK singles - ranked!Black Sabbath - every album - ranked!David Byrne – (almost) all of his albums - ranked!Miles Davis\u0027s 20 greatest albums – ranked!Lil Wayne\u0027s albums - ranked!Every Mercury prize-winning album - ranked!The Rolling Stones – every album - ranked!10 best Paul Simon albums - ranked!Bruce Springsteen\u0027s albums - ranked!Kanye West – every album - ranked!Stevie Wonder\u0027s albums - ranked!20 greatest breakup songs ever - ranked!Aphex Twin\u0027s best songs - ranked!Barry Manilow – all his greatest songs - ranked!Cher\u0027s 30 greatest songs - ranked!The 30 greatest Disney songs –\u0026nbspranked!Elton John\u0027s 50 greatest songs - ranked!From Drake to Wet Wet Wet: songs with 10 weeks at No 1 - ranked!From MC5 to Jeff Mills: the greatest Detroit tracks ever - ranked!Giorgio Moroder\u0027s 20 greatest songs - ranked!Nirvana\u0027s 20 greatest songs - ranked!The best songs from teen movies - ranked!The best UK garage tracks - ranked!The greatest banned songs of all time - ranked!The greatest ever female rap tracks - ranked!The greatest pop music dance crazes - ranked!All 43 Spice Girls songs - ranked!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcfe59549992952d27c14827702c2b324bac4ff1/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1004c36ecf49815729edcbe6d936ff83","title":"a sneaker peek behind the scenes at new balance","story":"Since 1982, New Balance has produced its flagship 990s at one of two US factories. We take a look at the craftsmanship that goes into each trainer at the site in MassachusettsFew trainers can claim a fanbase as erse as that of the New Balance 990 series. The first trainer to cost $100 when it was released in 1982, it was a performance running shoe that was eventually embraced for its nerdy dad look (the late Steve Jobs was a fan), while also acquiring street cred in Baltimore and DC. Meanwhile, the 990v4, which was released in 2016, popped up at fashion shows while being name checked by rappers such as Meek Mill and Lil Yachty.Each pair of 990v5s takes three hours to make they’re constructed from more than 30 different components and are handled by more than 30 workers. Tejada is the leader of the “closing” team, which puts the final touches on the shoe – hand-sewing the leather and suede in the heel. She’s been sewing at New Balance for 31 years, and first put needle to thread when she was a nine-year-old girl under the watchful eye of her mother, who was a seamstress in the Dominican Republic, where Tejada grew up.“I have sewn all my life. This is my pride,” she says. “When I’m sewing, I am happy – I am doing what I learned, with high quality. No run-off. Clean lines, everything where it needs to be.”Eric Vassall, the senior product manager at New Balance in charge of the 990 series, believes the craftsmanship and experience that workers such as Tejada bring to bear is part of what has made the shoe appeal to so many distinct markets.“I’ve been here 19 years and you see generation after generation after generation. So you have the mother who has been here that taught the daughter, who had taught the son,” he says.And at New Balance, the workers don’t just make the shoes – they are also integrated into the design process. This is only possible because, unlike most of its competitors, New Balance both manufactures and designs the bulk of its trainers in the same offices. This means that instead of emails going back and forth across different time zones, workers can give designers and engineers direct feedback in person.For Vassall, the fact that his team only works a few floors above the production line has been crucial. It allows them to make quick adjustments and, ultimately, produce a better product.“I would say for the latest version of the 990, the 990v5, we always would come downstairs and talk to the craftspeople and say: ‘Hey, what’s working, what’s not working?’”Jesse Plouffe, the product developer who worked on the 990v5, says workers like Tejada have made him better at his job.“They’re experts. I can’t tell them how to stitch the shoe. I have no idea how to stitch it. I know what I want to do, but they are experts and the value they add is incredible,” he says.And the atmosphere on the line embodies that spirit of collaboration. The workers move quickly – they each have just 22.5 seconds to complete their task – but still find moments to greet each other warmly.Luis Puello, a 51-year-old leather cutter, carefully runs his hands across a sheet of pig’s hide, looking for defects that he marks with a laser before a machine makes a cut. Over the years, he says, he has developed a better feel for the leather, quickly sensing which parts will function best in different areas of the shoe.He smiles when asked what he thinks about the 990s that he helps make every day. “When the job is done, you see what you’ve done, and you feel proud,” he says.New Balance’s 990v5s are available at the New Balance London flagship store or newbalance"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e45c4c0421651847b2fb3c89c779c96825af739a/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9104a8fbe287510bd6c4115b3bfdbaa","title":"the evolution of the new balance 99x series in pictures","story":"The New Balance 990v5 – which was released in the UK in May this year – is the latest trainer in a 37-year footwear dynasty.

Otherwise you’re basing actual lawmaking on the belief women lie.”Buckland said he agreed that “particular crimes should not be singled out, particularly sexual allegations”.No 10 said Buckland, a former criminal barrister, was not announcing any change approved by the prime minister. “This is not government policy,” Johnson’s spokesman said.The Ministry of Justice also moved to distance itself from Buckland’s comments, saying: “This isn’t departmental policy.” It said Buckland would not be giving further interviews on the subject and it would now be handled by Downing Street.In his interview with the Times, Buckland suggested an accused person’s previous reputation could play a part in whether they were granted anonymity.“Let’s say you are a reputable local business person who is accused of fraud,” he said. “Your good name is going to be really undermined by this mere accusation. That might be a meritorious case for anonymity.“Let’s say you are a person with a list of previous convictions. You’ve committed offences. There is intelligence out there that suggests that other victims might come forward. Is that a case where anonymity should be automatic?”Ian Murray, the director of the Society of Editors, said it was “absurd to suggest that in a liberal democracy we are going to create a system of justice that enables the rich, the powerful and celebrities to be protected when they are under investigation for serious crimes but the ordinary man or woman would be offered no such protections.”Murray said there was a slippery slope towards a situation where the actions of the police could not be scrutinised and arrests could not be publicised. “This is surely one of the worst aspects of a totalitarian state,” he said.The Independent Group for Change party leader, Anna Soubry, also a former criminal barrister, said she backed a proposal where “all suspects (whatever the allegation) should not be named until charge save for exceptional circumstances and with leave of crown court judge”.Daniel Janner, the son of the late Labour peer Greville Janner who was the subject of sexual offence allegations before his death, which his family have fiercely denied, said he was heartened by Buckland’s comments.Janner, the founder of Falsely Accused Iniduals for Reform (Fair), which is backed by Richard, said: “This will introduce fairness into the criminal justice system and is a reform that is long overdue. I am proud that Fair, with the support of singer Sir Cliff Richard and DJ Paul Gambaccini and others, appears to have changed the laws of this country for the good.”Gambaccini was arrested in 2013 over sexual offence allegations and publicly named in the case. Police took almost a year to announce he would not face charges as there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him.Similarly, Richard was named after his Berkshire flat was raided in 2014 and he publicly denied sexual offence allegations before police confirmed he would not be charged in 2016."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f07e58ca548e7fa09e3531a0bb07174d194a741d/0_16_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b8f5baded07fe1272325641c45b6dc2","title":"the view from brecon and radnorshire voters byelection","story":"Voters share their opinions in Welsh town where Lib Dems and Brexit party hope to steal Tory votesGreg Collins, a 53-year-old care worker, waved off the bright turquoise open-topped Brexit party bus as it began one of its final grand tours of the Brecon and Radnorshire constituency and declared that Nigel Farage’s candidate would be getting his vote.“I was a Labour supporter for a long time but they have let us down – Tony Blair lied over the Iraq war,” said Collins. “The Lib Dems helped bring austerity on us so I won’t have anything to do with them.”And the Tories? Collins, it turns out, was one of 150 or so people who stood in the drizzle outside Brecon Guildhall this week hoping to get a glimpse of the new prime minister when he visited mid-Wales before Thursday’s byelection. But the crowd was left disappointed, with Boris Johnson only making a flying visit to an enterprise park on the fringe of the town rather than meeting and greeting the voters.“I was keen to see him and if I’d have had the chance I’d have liked to speak to him,” said Collins. “I waited there for nearly two hours and he didn’t turn up. The common man gets stiffed all the time. I’m voting for Mr Farage this time and if he turns out to be a liar, I won’t vote again.”In truth, the byelection is just about the last thing Johnson needs. It is his first major test as prime minister and if, as is widely expected, the Liberal Democrats win, his working majority in the Commons will be reduced to just one.The Brexit party candidate, Des Parkinson, a former police chief superintendent, called the Tory decision to put Davies up again as arrogant. “He’s doing the Tory cause here no good.”Activists for the Brexit party have flooded in. Diana Coad, a Tory defector from Berkshire, was running the buzzing Brecon campaign office on Wednesday – and making sure those getting on the bus had been to the toilet before departure. “They’re a smashing bunch. They come from all over,” she said.One absentee is Farage. The Brexit party MEP Nathan Gill explained that the leader was spending time in the US “with his friend Donald Trump” and also planning a much larger campaign.“We’re in general election mode,” said Gill. “He’s got to make sure we’re fighting fit and ready for the big one.” Gill said he thought there would be a general election on 24 October. “Put a fiver on it.”In 2017 the results were as follows:\u0026nbspDespite the guilty verdict in court and the successful recall petition, Conservatives\u0027 Chris Davies is standing again and will hope to retain the seat. If he doesn\u0027t, new prime minister Boris Johnson will find his tiny working majority in parliament further diminished.Jane Dodds is standing for the Liberal Democrats, and Tom Davies is standing for Labour. The Brexit Party will be represented by Des Parkinson.In a move intended to to avoid splitting the \u0027remain\u0027 vote in the constituency, the Green party and Plaid Cymru have decided not to stand candidates, urging their supporters to back Dodds and the Lib Dems.Lady Lily Pink is standing for the Monster Raving Loony party.Of course, not everyone was impressed by the bright blue bus and the Brexit party bluster.Les, a sheep farmer, was taking his ease in the sunshine when the vehicle drove through Brecon town centre. “They’re the sort that are here today, gone tomorrow,” he said.Agriculture has been at the centre of this campaign with warnings of heartache for sheep farmers and even civil unrest if the UK leaves the EU with no deal.Les voted for remain and will be backing the Lib Dems at the byelection. “Boris is thinking he can get a deal. I very much doubt he can. With him in charge we’re heading for a no deal. That’s a bad job for us. All the work we’ve done will be undone. It will mean a big adjustment.”Three doors along from the Brexit party office, the Lib Dem campaign HQ was even more lively. The Lib Dems held this seat between 1997 and 2015 and believe they will win it back.Candy Piercy had just arrived from Buckinghamshire to help the party’s candidate Jane Dodds. A veteran of byelections up and down the country, Piercy said she was shocked the Tories had chosen Davies to stand again. “I wonder if it’s because they want to blame him for losing it,” she said.Kirsty Williams, the Lib Dem Welsh assembly member for Brecon and Radnorshire, said the campaign was not just about farming and Brexit.“But when they are not talking about Brexit they want to talk about public expenditure, about infrastructure, austerity and hyper-local issues such as is the library going to survive.”Williams criticised Johnson’s no-show in the town centre – a stark contrast to the efforts of the new Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, who has visited four times.“Quite clearly this was a very stage-managed visit with extensive care taken to avoid scrutiny,” she said. “In a constituency particularly vulnerable to no-deal Brexit, local people are right to expect the Conservatives to explain why they are pursuing it. The fact they shied away speaks volumes.”Davies, however, said he did not regret standing. “The support I’ve had from the people of Brecon and Radnorshire has been immense,” he said. “These aren’t just constituents. They are former clients, friends, family. It was they that encouraged me to stand again.”He insisted he had not meant to commit an offence over his expenses – which concerned the submitting of fake invoices for nine framed landscape photographs, costing £700, to decorate his office in the town of Builth Wells.“I regret making a mistake, clearly. A mistake was made in my paperwork. This was a legitimate expense. There was no financial gain. It was a pure mistake and I’ve paid a heavy price.”Asked whether he was sorry for causing his new leaders such a headache, he said: “There are many things the prime minister will have a headache over. I’m sure this byelection is one of them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e1e451b584a678b6a7d2590f429579188fba7f6/0_140_6075_3645/master/6075.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=889f6871123ba879eb2597c89d67ce22","title":"alcohol minimum price law obeyed across scotland says report","story":"Scotland’s pioneering policy of minimum pricing for alcohol has been successfully implemented, with compliance high across the country, according to the first report to evaluate its effectiveness.The study by NHS Health Scotland also welcomed the policy as having “the potential to improve Scotland’s relationship with alcohol and reduce the harm it causes”.Minimum unit pricing (MUP) for all alcoholic drinks, set at 50p a unit, was eventually introduced in May last year after repeated attempts led by the Scotch Whisky Association to derail the proposals in the courts.Scottish ministers believe the policy, which means a standard bottle of whisky (700ml) must cost at least £14 and a two-litre bottle of cider £5, will save approximately 400 lives over the next five years and lead to about 8,000 fewer alcohol-related hospital admissions.The report, which collated the experiences of police and local authority officials with a licensing remit, found that there had been no increase in illegal and unlicensed alcohol activity since the law was introduced, while pubs, clubs and restaurants, which typically charge higher prices for drink than off-licences and supermarkets, had been largely unaffected by the policy.One of the greatest risks of non-compliance was found along the border with England, where some retailers remained uncertain which licensing regime they fell under.Officials working in border areas also reported they were aware of people obtaining their home delivery shopping from stores located in England because MUP would not apply to the online purchases.The report noted anecdotal evidence of people going to stores in England to stock up on alcohol for themselves or their friends.The report also identified smaller retailers using the policy as an excuse to increase their prices on alcohol products not affected by MUP. One licensing standards officer said: “A lot of them have used the minimum unit price as an opportunity to just creep up all of their alcohol prices and blame it on Nicola Sturgeon.”Officials reported the retailers were already describing some changes in purchasing habits: “For example, some customers who were previously known to buy large-volume, high-strength ciders, and were thought to no longer be able to afford them under the price increase of MUP, were now, reportedly, buying bottles of wine.”Elinor Dickie, a public health intelligence adviser at NHS Health Scotland and author of the report, said that this first study on implementation represented a crucial foundation for the policy’s evaluation.“Minimum unit pricing has the potential to improve Scotland’s relationship with alcohol and reduce the harm it causes. But MUP in the form we have it in Scotland hasn’t been put it in place anywhere before. That’s why it’s so important to gather evidence of its impact through a robust and comprehensive evaluation.”Similar legislation is to come into force next year in Wales. Ministers Northern Ireland were considering minimum pricing before the Stormont power-sharing government collapsed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bffc137105b03ff5eeee6a2172943b43ff816bb/233_757_3007_1804/master/3007.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f898f274d55649ff6510fe41ec0c4fb","title":"charley hull round one womens british open woburn golf","story":"This great summer of golf homecomings has led to nervous times. Rory McIlroy said his hands trembled when gripping a club after the ovation he received on the 1st tee at the Open Championship the eight shots that followed played a crucial role in the Northern Irishman lasting only 36 holes at Portrush. Anguish was writ large over the face of Darren Clarke after his triple bogey at the 18th afforded him the same fate at his home club. With familiarity comes pressure.Enter Charley Hull. Back at Woburn, where she became a member aged nine, the 23-year-old admitted to the same sensation as McIlroy on the opening hole of the Women’s British Open. There was no upcoming damage though Hull did not post a single bogey en route to a 67.“With that first tee shot, you feel silly if you miss the fairway because it’s so wide,” Hull said. “It was not the best but I got it down there. My hands were shaking but some of my best shots have come when shaking. It’s not necessarily the worst thing.”This score had resonance beyond placing Hull near the top of the leaderboard. It was an improvement on any round from three years ago, when she toiled after so much fanfare in the buildup.Hull was understandably in bubbly form, having converted a birdie putt from 25ft at the last. That a five iron was required for her approach into that hole contrasts starkly with the nine iron used in the final round of 2016. Lengthening of Woburn’s Marquess Course for this tournament plays into Hull’s hands. In sticking to what had been a pre-tournament mantra, she insisted there were no thoughts of lifting the trophy on Sunday and emulating her good friend Georgia Hall, who won last year. “I’m only thinking about having a nap this afternoon after some shopping,” Hull said. “I just want to go out there and have fun. That’s the main goal this week. No expectations, just go out there and have fun. I am not getting ahead of myself.”On a serene day, scoring was understandably good. Moriya Jutanugarn, seeking to propel herself back to the summit of the women’s game, matched Hull’s score. The South African Ashleigh Buhai signed for a seven-under-par 65, which would have been even better but for a bogey at the par-five 11th. Buhai’s best British Open finish is a share of 30th, two years ago. “I played in the practice round and the wind was like 30ks an hour,” she said. “I was like: ‘Whoa, this is brutal’ but then today was perfect, everything you wanted, soft greens, hardly any wind and you could throw it at the pin.”Danielle Kang trails Buhai by one after the American signed for front and back nines of 33. The R\u0026ampA’s upcoming management of this major – with 2020 and 2021 venues named as Troon and Porthcawl respectively – has led to speculation it may become the sole domain of links territory. Kang, for one, would not appreciate a permanent switch.“This fits my game way better,” she said. “I feel like my track record on links golf, it’s not very good. I like if I have to hit 165, it goes 165 instead of hitting in one place and ending up another. I’m enjoying Woburn a lot.”Lexi Thompson, fresh from a misplaced passport controversy, opened with a 71. Laura Davies birdied the 2nd but slumped to an 82. More surprising was Jennifer Kupcho – fresh from a tie for second at the Evian Championship – unable to fare no better than 77."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d77dde761f2200eedc525899db467ea939bbb0c/0_103_4802_2881/master/4802.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9324e3b04ad410912e49a423022b0f35","title":"khadijah mellah first uk jockey to wear hijab wins race goodwood horse racing","story":"At 1.10pm on Thursday, Khadijah Mellah, an 18-year-old from Peckham, became the first jockey to ride in a race in Britain wearing a hijab. Just over a minute later, she made history again by riding the winner, as her mount Haverland got the better of a tight finish to win the Magnolia Cup at Goodwood, a charity event in support of Wellbeing Of Women.The unlikely story of Mellah’s journey from the Ebony Horse Club in Brixton to one of the world’s most famous racecourses had attracted plenty of media attention in recent weeks, but nothing to compare with the scrum as she returned to the winner’s enclosure, amid a level of acclaim that racegoers usually reserve for Frankie Dettori. Dozens of family members and friends were also at the course to welcome her back.Mellah was the youngest jockey in Thursday’s 12-strong field, and up against several opponents who had learned to ride almost as soon as they could walk. Mellah, by contrast, did not sit on a horse until her early teens, after her mother noticed an advertisement for the Ebony Horse Club, which aims to “transform young lives through horses in south London’s most disadvantaged communities”.Oli Bell, a presenter with ITV Racing as well as a patron of Ebony Horse Club, arranged for one of its riders to take part in the Magnolia Cup, against celebrities including the former Olympic gold-medal winning cyclist Victorian Pendleton and Vogue Williams, an Irish reality TV star and model.In an interview with the  last month, Mellah explained that she first discovered the Ebony Horse Club when her mother saw a leaflet at a local mosque. “She said ‘there’s a riding club in Brixton’. I was like, yeah, Mum, sure. Absolutely no way. Oh my God, there is!”Mellah’s victory followed two months of intensive training at the British Racing School in Newmarket, and dozens of early starts at the nearby stable of Charlie Fellowes, Haverland’s trainer. Hayley Turner, British racing’s most successful female jockey with a string of big-race wins to her name, also provided her with expert coaching.“I’m just so glad that everyone’s here to support me,” Mellah said. “Haverland is such an amazing horse and I love him so much.What happened was that Haverland quickened towards the leaders before edging in front a few strides from the line.“When I passed the person next to me, it was like, Oh my God, I can’t believe this is happening, I’m doing it’,” she said, “and then I saw all the family and friends and I just started crying uncontrollably. It’s been amazing.“Ambitious women can make it. That’s all I want to represent, be ambitious and do it. I’ve had so much support, and I can’t wait to see other stories of other women getting into the industry and doing amazing.”Mellah is due to begin studying mechanical engineering at university this autumn, but hopes to apply for an amateur jockeys’ licence to extend her career in the saddle.“I bumped into Frankie Dettori yesterday and he gave me a hug and it was like, ‘Oh my God, this is happening!’,” she said. “It really gave me a lift.“Even in my wildest dreams I never imagined this could happen. I only sat on a racehorse a couple of months ago and I am just never going to forget this day. To be honest, I want to go back and do it all over again, what an incredible feeling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b081b8fb953cecd128c8c272bc23a590c94f50c2/553_90_4126_2477/master/4126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dea379e1a2f3589c7e6379453d7b0cd","title":"wales taulupe faletau out rugby world cup broken collarbone","story":"Wales will be without one of their most experienced and influential forwards in the World Cup after their Lions No 8 Taulupe Faletau suffered a broken collarbone in training this week.Wales have got used to life without the 72-cap Faletau who was a virtual ever-present in the side after making his debut in 2011 until he joined Bath five years later. He has started only two Six Nations matches in his three seasons in the west country having suffered knee and arm injuries.The 28-year-old has not played for Wales since the end of the 2018 Six Nations campaign, twice suffering a broken arm last season to restrict his starts for the club to five, but his absence will be felt even if back row is one of their better stocked positions.“The injury was sustained in an innocuous training ground incident and will require surgery,” said Wales in a statement. “A prognosis and return to play timeframe will be established after surgery.​ The Wales squad and management wish Taulupe the very best with his recovery.”Only last week Faletau expressed his hope that his run of injuries had come to an end, saying: “I didn’t realise at the time but being away from rugby for that amount of time, the hunger is there more now.

This is getting a little surreal - it’s barely three hours since Australia were up to their neck in bother.79th over: Australia 273-9 (Smith 137, Lyon 8) Smith muscles Broad for his 17th four. This is up there with the great tone-setting innings of modern Ashes series - Sir Ian Botham in 1986-87, Michael Slater in 1994-95, Joe Root in 2015 and Steve Smith again in 2017-18.“What a player Steve Smith is, best in the world by a country mile,” says Kevin Casserly. “You lot are great at moaning, the sandpaper incident, the Hand of God etc. Get over it, credit where it’s due, he turned a collapse into a reasonable score.”Fair point. I’ll have a word with my lot and ask them to get over it.78th over: Australia 268-9 (Smith 132, Lyon 8) As frustrating as this partnership has been for England and their supporters, it sets up a storming day’s play tomorrow. My instinct is that England are in trouble, but I said that last night and they won comfortably. That’s the beauty of cricket: it’s okay to know the square root of diddly squat.“I think this form of fielding complicity - employed by almost everyone - makes absolutely no sense,” says Kristian Petterson. “Try and get the batsman at the crease out. That is all. Don’t overthink it, just try to get him out. Yes, I AM angry about this recovery and am irrationally thrashing out.”Yep, I agree - especially as it has backfired in the past with Steve Smith. 77th over: Australia 267-9 (Smith 131, Lyon 8) Smith whirls Broad behind square for four to bring up the fifty partnership with Lyon. He has scored 22 from his last 11 deliveries, and Australia have more than doubled their score since the loss of the eighth wicket. Lyon joins in the fun by driving Broad down the ground for four more. England look in urgent need of rain andor an ice bath. They are ragged. “The statisticians agree that Bradman is the greatest outlier in sport...” says Scott Chapman. “There have been a few more cricketers come through since 2015, but DB is still way out there in any sport.” 76th over: Australia 258-9 (Smith 126, Lyon 4) Smith has gone straight past one-day mode and into T20 mode. He drags Woakes over mid-on for four and clouts another boundary to midwicket. The sheer certainty of his batting has broken England’s will yet again. This has to be one of his greatest innings.“Not to be a pedant or a miser, but Steve Smith made no mistake,” says Elliot Carr-Barnsley. “He paid the (pretty gentle) price and we shouldn’t further punish him for it, but nor should we sugar coat deliberate cheating by one of the game’s most recognisable and influential figures as a mistake. Sandpaper didn’t magic its way onto the field, and it was cowardly to make Bancroft hold it instead of himself.” That makes him sound like a Machiavellian genius rather than a fundamentally decent bloke who made some poor decisions because he was mentally shot. Each to their own but I have a bit more sympathy for him.75th over: Australia 248-9 (Smith 117, Lyon 4) Smith survives an LBW review off the new bowler Broad - it was missing leg by a mile - and hits the next two balls for four. The first was an inside-edge wide of leg stump, the second a lofted straight drive that doesn’t impress Broad one iota.“He may or may not be a good man (I don’t know him at all) but I question the use of the word ‘awful’,” says Kristian Petterson. “He did something wrong and received punishment - that punishment wasn’t awful, it was punishment. Unless you think the punishment was unjust?”I thought it was way over the top, yeah, but I’m not sure we have the time, or I the energy, to go into all that again. But even if the punishment was appropriate, I wouldn’t wish that level of public shaming on him. 74th over: Australia 240-9 (Smith 109, Lyon 4) Smith rocks back to cut Moeen emphatically for four. England don’t know where to bowl to him. Since the start of the 2017-18 Ashes, these are his Test scores against England: 141*, 40, 6, 239, 76, 102*, 83, 104*. That’s 796 runs at an average 0f 159.20.“The bookies have England 12, Australia more than 21,” says Andrew Hurley. “Surely it’s closer than that? Par looks 240-250, and with Jimmy probably unable to bowl in the second innings...” Yes, a lot depends on overhead conditions but I would make Australia favourites. This has been a really bad final session for England, although the injury to Anderson has made things so much harder for them.73rd over: Australia 235-9 (Smith 104, Lyon 4) Steve Smith makes a glorious, cathartic hundred on his return to Test cricket! He drives Stokes through the covers for four before waving his bat to the Australian balcony, who are all on their feet. Never mind the sandpaper feel the grit. This has been an innings of immense character, not to mention intelligence, skill and sheer geeky love of batting. Smith looks very emotional as he embraces Lyon. This is spine-tingling stuff, a wonderful moment for a good man who made a mistake and paid an awful price. That, truly, is a great innings. 72nd over: Australia 229-9 (Smith 99, Lyon 4) Smith launches Moeen for a huge six to move to 98. He’s content to take a single off the fourth delivery of the over, which gives Lyon two balls to survive. And he does, to lusty cheers from the pocket of Australian fans. Steve Smith is one run away from a quite immense century.71st over: Australia 222-9 (Smith 92, Lyon 4) Lyon squirts Stokes to the third-man boundary to get off the mark, and then survives the rest of the over. At this percise moment in time, Ben Stokes isn’t entirely high on life.“I know this is only First Day, First Test, but given Jimmy’s injury, this pair are wrestling the game back and we don’t seem to have many ideas on what to do,” says Guy Hornsby. “Permission to get pretty moody and swig a beer on the way home, please. 122-8 and they could end the day 250-9. The Anger...”I wish you lot weren’t so ceaselessly pessimisitic. Chill out, can we.70th over: Australia 218-9 (Smith 92, Lyon 0) Smith mangles a vile full toss from Moeen through midwicket for four before surviving a stumping referral after a smart bit of work from Bairstow. “Following OBO from hospital ward in Zakynthos, Greece,” says Gavin McCarthy. “Teenage daughter, Lucy, admitted with collapsed lung after flight (ouch!). She’s been napping and every time she falls asleep, England take a wicket. She’s been awake for an hour or so now and shows no signs of drowsiness. Every time I try to sing her a lullaby, I’m met with an eye-rolling, ‘Shut up, Dad!’ Hope she falls asleep before end of play. PS daughter improving day by day and we hope to be out of hospital tomorrow.”I was going to joke about your priorities but it doesn’t really seem appropriate. All the best to Lucy, you and the rest of your family – that sounds really unpleasant. Out of interest, she asleep yet?69th over: Australia 212-9 (Smith 86, Lyon 0) Smith, left with the No11 Lyon, turns down a single for the first time. Stokes tries to keep Smith on strike by ramming bouncers over his head when he gets the line wrong, Joel Wilson calls wide. Smith takes a single off the penultimate delivery to keep the strike and increase Stokes’s agita.68th over: Australia 210-9 (Smith 85, Lyon 0) “An obvious response to David Hindle would involve modern bats, protective equipment, shorter boundaries and (more subjectively) bowling standards, albeit Smith has higher quality fielding to contend with,” says Geoff Wignall. “I’d also suggest that Smith worries even the best bowlers but doesn’t frighten them as Viv could and that the best of Viv was a good way north of Smith’s best. Anyway, Smith just isn’t that cool. In a broader perspective anyone who considers Smith the best they’ve seen is clearly too young to have seen Sobers, even after an all-night session.”Boy did England need that. Moeen Ali comes into the attack and strikes with his second ball. Siddle inside-edged a lovely delivery, which turned and bounced from around the wicket, and Buttler took a really smart catch at short leg. Siddle gets a generous ovation for a superb, resourceful innings of 44 from 85 balls.67th over: Australia 210-8 (Smith 85, Siddle 44) Bairstow appeals politely for caught behind against Siddle after swooping spectacularly to his left. The bowler Stokes wasn’t interested. England are miles behind the over rate, which will cost them Test Championship points should they win any in this match. That’s worth keeping an eye on, because teams will lose many more points in a five-Test series than if there are only two Tests. If I have understood the regulations - and there’s a minuscule chance of that - there is the potential for high farce.“The largest earthquake ever recorded (Chile, 1961), was between two and three times as big as the next largest (varies between Sumatra, 2004, and Alaska 1964),” says David Hindle. “If you look at the magnitude scale, it doesn’t appear that way (M9.6 or 9.5 for Chile vs. M9.4 or 9.3 for the others, but a single unit of moment magnitude is equivalent to a 30-fold increase in released energy. But Bradman is still ridiculous for a human.”66th over: Australia 208-8 (Smith 84, Siddle 43) Smith runs down the track to drive Denly down the ground for four. Edgbaston, and the England team, have gone very flat. I’m not sure which is the chicken and which is the egg. Here’s our own Daniel Harris. “KP told me that when they went through the South Africa team to work out plans for them, the best they could do with Kallis was ‘run out candidate early in his innings’.”And if you haven’t read that book, you should. It’s nothing like the score-settling autobiography just a brilliant insight into the mind of a massive genius.65th over: Australia 201-8 (Smith 78, Siddle 42) Siddle works Stokes off the pads to bring up the 200. It’s been such an impressive effort from this pair, who have batted without ego or fanfare. That said, England are really missing Jimmy Anderson, which has effectively left them with a three-man attack.“To earn a bit of beer money whilst a student a friend of mine set himself up in business as a cheesy DJ for hire,” says David Tant. “He called TNT Discos (Top Notch Tunes), and to our surprise he actually got hired a few times. One of them being for a Golf Club annual dinner. ‘Son of A Preacher Man’ was requested by a predominantly white-haired audience for a nice gentle dance. He only had the version on the Pulp Fiction soundtrack. Unfortunately he accidentally queued up the first track, which is a bit of dialogue from the film: ‘Any of you f***in’ pr**ks move and I’ll execute every mother*****g last one of you.’ He didn’t get paid, but personally I think if you book someone called Top Notch Tunes at a low price you get what you deserve.”Including some explosive language, honkety honk.64th over: Australia 198-8 (Smith 76, Siddle 41) And now for something completely different: Joe Denly’s legspin. He starts with a maiden to Siddle, which was done and dusted in approximately 90 seconds.“So, according to Steve Hudson, either you suffer because the team around you is rubbish, or you suffer because they’re too good - an essentially unfalsifiable hypothesis,” sniffs David Hindle. “Next it will be ‘English batsman average less because they play in the bowlers’ paradise of England more than the rest.’ So why don’t English bowlers top the bowling averages by light years then? And as to the late career decline. I give you Kumar Sangakkara. Some of them just don’t know when to stop. Smith is already, statistically, in a place no batsman has been since Bradman. In terms of number of runs, number of series, tours etc. versus current average, nothing in the modern game has come close.”Well, Sangakkara was a pretty big exception. I’ll happily bet £100, for charity, that Smith finishes his Test career with an average below 60. Not that either of us will remember this conversation when he retires in 2025 – I just wanted to make everyone aware of how much imaginary work I do for charity.62nd over: Australia 193-8 (Smith 76, Siddle 36) “All this talk about Smith and averages has me musing for the millionth time about how remarkable Bradman’s average is,” says Pete Salmon. “Which got me thinking – I’m pretty sure, at approximately one third better than thousands of other players, he’s the greatest outlier in all of sport – no one runs the 100m in six seconds for instance. But that got me thinking – is he the greatest outlier, human or otherwise, in anything? No planet (I think) is one third bigger than every other etc... Obviously its limited to things that are quantifiable, so no poetry or sunsets, but do any of your science boffin followers have anything that comes close?”61st over: Australia 190-8 (Smith 76, Siddle 33) Ben Stokes replaces Woakes. Smith walks across his stumps to pull carefully round the corner for four. There’s a lovely paragraph in Mike Atherton’s autobiography which I suspect may also apply to Smith. During the 2001 Ashes series, England listed detailed bowling plans for each Australian batsman in the dressing-room. One entry was shorter than the rest: Siddle steers Stokes deliberately to the third-man boundary to make it an excellent over for Australia. England look relatively ragged just now.60th over: Australia 179-8 (Smith 71, Siddle 27) Siddle, lured onto the front foot by Broad, is beaten by a classic legcutter. Later in the over he gets a very thick edge through gully for a single. Broad has bowled jolly well today.59th over: Australia 175-8 (Smith 70, Siddle 24) Smith steals a single after inside-edging a Woakes inducker onto the pad, and then Siddle drives jauntily through extra cover for a couple. He is playing superbly and has now scored as many as Warner, Bancroft, Khawaja and Wade combin ed.“This first innings of the first Test of the series is the 2019 Ashes in miniature, no?” writes58th over: Australia 172-8 (Smith 69, Siddle 22) Siddle works Broad for two to bring up a calm, intelligent fifty partnership. England don’t look like taking a wicket just now, and Broad and Woakes look slightly weary after bowling 17 overs apiece. “This Smith fella might be all that but I can barely bring myself to watch him bat,” says Ian Copestake. “Some of his average should deducted for failing to make me meow.”He makes me ow, usually at the precise moment he reaches 150, again.57th over: Australia 169-8 (Smith 68, Siddle 20) Woakes beats Siddle with a lovely slower ball. It’s hard to know what to make of this score. The pitch has done a bit, but I suspect a lot of the movement is due to the overhead conditions. My hunch is that this will be a low-scoring dogfight, but I’ll level with you, I haven’t really got a clue.“SF Barnes you say?” says Gary Naylor. “One of my favourite pieces of cricket writing - Peter Gibbs meets the great man.”55.5 overs: Australia 168-8 (Smith 67, Siddle 20) It’s raining again, although play will continue for now. Smith cuts Broad for a single to move to 67 - and take his average in the last 10 Ashes Tests to 99.66. Not exactly Bradmanesque, is it?After Siddle drives Broad for four, the umpires decide to take the players off. But by the time the covers reach the middle, the rain has relented sufficiently for the umpires to decide play can continue.55th over: Australia 163-8 (Smith 66, Siddle 16) Siddle clips Woakes through midwicket for four, another sensible, efficient stroke. There are useful runs for Australia, who were in a heap at 122 for eight.“David Hindle wonders why Viv R and Brian L didn’t average significantly more than 50 in their careers,” says Steve Hudson. “The answer is that Lara played for a WI team steadily going into reverse and often seemed to be scoring most of their runs for them, in losing causes. Viv had the opposite problem I think, that in a side that were steamrolling everyone else throughout the 80s, his runs were less and less important to a strong batting side, which translated into more cameo 60s and 70s, and a lack of daddy hundreds. We have no idea which way Smith’s average will go, but I’d be very impressed and surprised if he defies boredom, burnout and slowing reflexes to average 70.”Most great batsmen lose 5-10 runs from their mid-career average once their eyes and resilience start to go. From memory Ricky Ponting had a peak average of 59.99 in December 2006 and retired six years later with an average of 51.85. I’d be pretty surprised if Smith finishes with a career average over 60.54th over: Australia 159-8 (Smith 66, Siddle 12) Stuart Broad returns to the attack after tea. Siddle edges a good delivery just short of third slip, where Stokes es to his right to make a good half-stop and save a couple of runs. “I see Dan Lucas’ iPad mishap and raise him an iPhonehearing aid debacle,” boasts Kim Thonger. “Marrying my final and favourite wife almost four years ago, I inadvertently played the romantic wedding music in the registry office through my hearing aid, which is set up by default to covertly receive the streaming Test match commentary from my phone in ‘important meetings’, reimagining the silent disco but not in a helpful way.”I hope your final and favourite wife saw the funny side.The players are back on the field. It looks a lot brighter, too.And it looks like a very, very good time to bowl.“Syd Barnes!” says Mike Daniels, referring to this list of successful England bowlers in home Tests. “The famously grumpycantankerous Staffordshire bowler. Imagine Bob Willis on a bad day x10. Played for donkey’s years in the Leagues. Was still pro-ing in his sixties.” Mike, I think you’re a bit out of order calling him cantankerous. This piece from David Frith shows the real Syd Barnes.Here’s a little more detail about Jimmy Anderson’s calf injury, which could rule him out for a wee while. “Sir Viv averaged about 65 with a couple of thousand runs on the board, just after the massacre of England in 1976,” says David Hindle. “The one with two double hundreds in the same series. But it was all downhill from there. Smith is something else altogether. His trajectory, give or take a few blips (Sri Lanka a few winters ago for instance) is still upwards. He could be average 70 by the time he gets to 10,000 runs. You may ask why Viv (and Brian Lara) didn’t average 60 for their careers, and it would be an interesting discussion. But fact is, they didn’t, in fact they both averaged 10 less than Smith currently does, and what more can you say? Smith is in a class of his own, and may well remain there for the duration of his Test career.”I take all your points, but … Victor Trumper averaged 39. “I had virtually the same experience as Jack Jarvis in the 14th over,” says Dan Leach. “Friends of mine were getting married in Ireland in the grounds of Castle Ward (AKA Winterfell in Game of Thrones). I was entrusted with the iPad for the music. To this day, I don’t know how it happened, but instead of the classical music they had chosen as they walked down the tree-lined grove I managed to blast out ‘Murder She Wrote’ by Chaka Demus \u0026amp Pliers.”The start of the evening session has been delayed.

I’m now moving house and setting up a home office. I want to dispense with my laptop – the source of my problems – and buy a desktop and an ergonomic keyboard.I’m confused about whether to get an all-in-one or a PC with a separate monitor. I am only really going to use it for internet and typing articles. I realise that this means I can look to the cheaper end of the market, but is there much slowdown in speed at that end? Should I be spending the money to get a good processor? PollyLaptops can be considered harmful if used for prolonged serious work rather than casual use. If you have neck and shoulder problems, you should seek medical help. I’ve been saved twice by an excellent physiotherapist, at my own expense. I’ve also spent time and money mitigating problems, but there is no panacea. Buying an ergonomic keyboard is only one part of a solution that could also include the mouse, desk, chair, lighting, work habits and, perhaps, glasses.You don’t need a computer to get a repetitive strain injury (RSI). Housemaid’s knee, tennis elbow, writer’s cramp, potter’s wrist and other afflictions are much older than iPad neck, but they all have similar causes. According to the UK’s Health and Safety Executive (HSE), the risk factors include repetitive work, the use of sustained or excessive force, awkward and static working postures, and doing the same thing for long periods without taking rest breaks. Without job rotation, that last one may be the hardest to solve, though software can help.Unfortunately, people tend to feel invulnerable until they get an RSI. Just as losing a hard drive tends to persuade people that backups are a good idea, carpal tunnel syndrome is a great spur to taking ergonomics seriously. It’s better to do something before you reach that stage.Start with a sheet of paper, a tape measure, and a friend. Drawing a stick-figure diagram with your measurements will help you find products that will work well for someone of your height.To get the correct posture, your feet should be flat on the floor, and when sitting upright, your eyes should be roughly level with the top of the screen. Your friend can then measure the distance between your eyes and the floor. Everything else has to fit in between.Your thighs should be parallel to the floor or pointing very slightly downwards, which will fix the height of the seat of the chair. This won’t happen by magic, which is why proper office chairs have adjustable seats.As a cross-check, extend one arm horizontally. It should almost touch the centre of the screen.When you are trying to find the most comfortable position, some tweaking is inevitable. It’s therefore better to buy products that allow for minor adjustments. You can fudge things with cushions, footrests, and books under monitors, but it’s better to do it right.Some people have switched to standing desks, and some devices provide a choice. Varidesk, for example, says that “our simple design takes you from sitting to standing in just 3 seconds, requires no assembly and works with your existing furniture”. It also has a 30-day money-back guarantee. Other options range from aiBox’s ultra-cheap cardboard version to the motorised Gazedesk, which you can set by entering your height and weight in its smartphone app.A panel of experts commissioned by Public Health England recommended standing desks in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, so I feel guilty for never have tried one.An ergonomic keyboard lets you align the keys with your hands and arms, so there is no bend in your wrists. It may take months of small adjustments to reach that stage, so flexibility helps.Technically, almost any computer system will work if you set it up correctly. I prefer tower systems, which usually last longer because they are easier to expand, upgrade and repair. They have plenty of space for cooling, so they can use hotter, faster chips with TDPs of 60W to 130W. Laptops use cooler, slower chips – typically 5W to 25W – because it’s hard to manage heat in confined spaces, and their processors are throttled when they start to overheat.All-in-ones are tidier but they don’t have the power and expandability of a proper desktop, and you don’t get a choice of monitor. Also, if either the PC or the screen fails, you may lose both. If space is a problem, I’d rather go for an SFF (small form factor) or mini-PC instead.Several people have asked about buying new desktops so I may return to this topic, though the “laptop for uni” questions are becoming more urgent.You are right in thinking that you could get away with a slower processor and a traditional hard drive: an SSD makes less difference in a desktop where the hard drive is spinning all the time. However, there are no speed limits in computing, and it’s always better to have a faster PC. You can run more browsers with many more tabs, which would bring a slow PC to its knees.I’d rather not drop below 5,000 for a desktop, and 2,500 for a laptop that gets more casual use. Slow PCs are only cheaper if your time has no value.Have you got a question?

He also has purported connections to Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, and moved in elite social circles in New York, Florida and elsewhere.He is currently in jail after being arrested on 6 July. He pleaded not guilty several weeks ago.Epstein’s plans around his own progeny began to be talked about in the early 2000s, according to three sources contacted by the Times.“Epstein told scientists and businessmen about his ambitions to use his New Mexico ranch as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm and would give birth to his babies … Mr Epstein’s goal was to have 20 women at a time impregnated at his 33,000-sq-ft Zorro Ranch in a tiny town outside Santa Fe,” the Times said.Epstein’s field of study was labeled “transhumanism” but was an updated version of eugenics. Lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who defended Epstein in 2008 and has been named in a civil suit brought by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, told the Times he was appalled by the financier’s interest in genetic manipulation, given the Nazis’ use of eugenics in the 1930s.“Everyone speculated about whether these scientists were more interested in his views or more interested in his money,” Dershowitz told the Times.According to the paper, Epstein’s circle included the molecular engineer George Church Murray Gell-Mann, the discover of the quark the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould the neurologist and author Oliver Sacks and the theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek.On one occasion, Epstein held a lunch at Harvard’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, a program he had helped fund with a $6.5m donation. In 2011, he gave $20,000 to the Worldwide Transhumanist Association, a project that now operates as Humanity Plus.The Harvard cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker said he considered Epstein as an “intellectual impostor”.“He would abruptly change the subject, ADD-style, dismiss an observation with an adolescent wisecrack,” Pinker told the paper. The virtual reality pioneer Jaron Lanier said Epstein’s ideas did not rise to science that could be subjected to critical analysis.The scientific community, like Trump and much of New York and Palm Beach society, would sooner forget their association with Epstein.Humanity Plus vice-chairman Ben Goertzel, whose salary was once paid by Epstein, told the Times: “I have no desire to talk about Epstein right now. The stuff I’m reading about him in the papers is pretty disturbing and goes way beyond what I thought his misdoings and kinks were. Yecch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db82c47bbb2125b958c452a9a4572a71022c089e/0_206_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a8f019b9b1b09c57fb8d3123fe315b5","title":"inf treaty us russia arms control to end","story":"INF treaty, which kept nuclear missiles off European soil, was ‘an invaluable brake on nuclear war’, says António GuterresThe UN secretary general has warned that the world will lose “an invaluable brake on nuclear war” with the expiry of a cold war-era arms control treaty on Friday.The 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty has kept nuclear missiles off European soil for more than three decades, but the US and Russia have failed to agree on how to keep it alive.“This will likely heighten, not reduce, the threat posed by ballistic missiles,” António Guterres told reporters, adding that he was concerned about rising tensions between nuclear-armed states. There have already been signs of a rekindled arms race in the class of weapons that the treaty banned: ground-launched missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500km.Nearly 2,700 of the cruise and ballistic nuclear missiles were destroyed under the treaty, removing a potent source of European insecurity. A targeted country would only have a few minutes warning of a launch, fueling paranoia and hair-trigger alerts on both sides of the Iron Curtain.These weapons are now beginning to return.“2 August marks the demise of the INF, which played a major role in enhancing stability in Europe,” said Laura Kennedy, former US permanent representative to the conference on disarmament in Geneva. “Its termination could be both unsettling in Europe and could lead to new arms competition in other areas, such as Asia.”The death of the INF comes amid aggressive nuclear weapon modernisation programmes being carried out by the US and Russia. Among the new weapons the US is contemplating is a nuclear bunker-buster, considered and then shelved under the George W Bush administration.Russia has developed a land-based nuclear-capable cruise missile, which the US and its Nato allies say violates the INF range restrictions. Moscow initially denied the existence of the missile (known as the 9M729 or by its Nato designation, SSC-8) and then claimed its range was under 500km. It is thought likely to be a land-based version of the Russian navy Kalibr missile.“They are dual-capable, they can carry nuclear weapons, they can reach European cities within minutes, they are mobile, hard to detect and they also reduce the threshold of any potential use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict,” the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Wednesday.Russia’s refusal to scrap the weapon led Donald Trump to withdraw the US from the INF treaty, and the US is now developing at least three types of medium-range missiles, all of them designed for conventional warheads.The first of these, believed to be a land-based version of the Tomahawk cruise missile with a 1,000km range, is due to be tested later this month. A second option, a medium-range ballistic missile, is due to be tested in November, with a range of up to 4,000km. Third, the army is planning to develop a new missile to be mounted on a mobile launcher, either a ballistic weapon or a hypersonic glide vehicle.Pentagon officials have said the first weapon, the cruise missile, could be deployed within 18 months.The prospect of the INF’s demise on Friday is viewed with little enthusiasm among UK officials, not least because the country falls in the range of the previously banned intermediate-range surface-to-surface missiles.“It is a proper serious moment,” a Whitehall source observed, although there are no plans for the new administration of Boris Johnson to publicly mark the moment.European officials say there has been limited discussion with their US counterparts on Nato policy after INF, in part because European policy was focused on saving the treaty.Now that that has failed, UK officials argued there was unlikely to be an immediate return to a nuclear standoff between rival missile systems in Europe, as witnessed in the 1980s when US cruise and Pershing missiles were ranged against Soviet SS-20s.The new Russian missile is nuclear capable, but not necessarily nuclear armed. They are presently believed to be organised in four battalions, only one of which is west of the Urals, though they are mobile allowing for rapid redeployment.The US missiles are, for now, strictly conventional and Nato has said it has no intention of deploying nuclear missiles in Europe.“We will not mirror what Russia is doing,” Stoltenberg said.Furthermore, the Democratic majority leadership in the House of Representatives is opposed to the new US missiles, arguing there is no sign of a coherent strategy behind them, and has removed the $96m research and development budget for them from the House 2020 budget. The fate of the programmes now depends on the reconciliation process between the House and Senate versions.It is unclear where a US cruise missile would be based. They would have to be located in eastern Europe to be in range of Russian targets, but one of Washington’s closest allies in the region, Poland, has insisted there would have to be unanimous Nato support for their deployment, which is unlikely.“Any US attempt to force the alliance to accept the missiles or to go around Nato and try to negotiate a bilateral agreement with an inidual Nato member would be a significant source of ision within Nato and one Russia would be eager to try and exploit,” said Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association.Administration hawks led by John Bolton, the US national security adviser, are also eyeing a possible Pacific deployment as a counter to Chinese medium-range missiles. The fact that China was outside the INF was one of the reasons cited by Bolton and others in their opposition to the treaty. But basing problems would also be a serious obstacle in the Pacific, as any host nation would become a primary target for a pre-emptive attack.“Our east Asian allies aren’t exactly rushing to host these these missiles,” Reif said. They could be based on Guam, but that is 3,000 km from China, and expose the population on the tiny US Pacific territory.“There is no plan for what comes after INF,” said Pranay Vaddi, a former state department arms control official now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Not having a plan or not at least forecasting that you’re thinking of a plan of what to do for European security and Asian security after the treaty is what strikes me as irresponsible.”After the collapse of the INF, the last remaining arms control treaty is the 2010 New Start agreement limiting US and Russian strategic warheads, but that is due to expire in 2021 and Bolton has said it is unlikely to be extended."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3973985.1564648735!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ready for the bank holiday weekend here is the weather forecast","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBeachgoers enjoy the sunshine in Margate in south east England last week.

To tackle this, BirdWatch Ireland carried out rat-baiting across Dalkey island and nearby Lamb island before this year’s nesting season.Canes were also erected across a portion of Lamb island to exclude gulls from the tern colony.Tara Adcock, BirdWatch Ireland’s Dalkey tern warden, is delighted by the project’s success. “This project truly shows that if you give nature a chance, it can bounce back. It has been a real pleasure to work to protect these phenomenal birds. It’s incredible to think that in a few weeks, these chicks, along with their parents will undertake the longest migration in the natural world, all the way to the Antarctic.”Long-distance starThe Arctic tern, nicknamed “sea swallow” after its long tail streamers and buoyant flight, is the world’s greatest long-distance traveller, migrating further than any other animal.During our summer months, they breed in Ireland and other areas of the Northern Hemisphere and then fly all the way to the Southern Ocean, off Antarctica, where they wait out the northern winter. This means that they see more daylight each year than any other creature on the planet.Throughout the course of their lives Arctic terns can travel more than three million kilometres an especially impressive achievement for a bird that weighs just 100g.To put the overall distance which these birds travel into context, they migrate the equivalent of almost four round trips to the moon over the course of their lives (25-30 years).Ms Adcock said BirdWatch Ireland was thrilled with “how well this small but resilient colony has done this year.“Prior to this season, chicks surviving past two weeks, never mind fledging from Dalkey island itself, was unheard of.Lamb fledglingsOn top of the success on Dalkey island, Lamb island has also confirmed six fledglings, but the true figure is thought to be higher, with a further nine chicks waiting in the wings. Lamb island is a small, flat-topped granite islet that can be accessed on foot at low tides from the main island.The four uninhabited islands of the archipelago are under the management of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and officially form one of its public parks. They are separated from the mainland by Dalkey Sound. The main island is 11.2 hectares and a humpback shape with one designated place for boats to land.There is evidence of human occupation on the islands from Mesolithic times. Dalkey island is home to the remains of a 10th-century church – a national monument – as well as an early medieval promontory fort and a Martello tower and gun battery. There is also a holy well on the island, the Scurvy Well. Rare plants have also been recorded on the island. An informal ferry service operates to the main island."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3973454.1564641028!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar and coveney acting like fools over brexit claims bruce arnold","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘What is tough is watching the ridiculous behaviour of the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his foreign minister, Simon Coveney, trying to destroy, like wilful children, relations with an ancient and friendly neighbour’, Bruce Arnold writes in the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney are “uncertain fools” acting like “wilful children” in the destruction of Anglo-Irish relations, journalist Bruce Arnold has said.The UK is currently engaged in a stand-off with Dublin and Brussels over the withdrawal agreement that would secure the UK’s orderly exit from the EU. London is refusing to accept the inclusion of the backstop while Europe is refusing to drop it. Arnold, in an opinion article for the Daily  published on Wednesday, delivered a scathing assessment of the Government’s policy and approach to Brexit. “This is tough right now, being a proud and loyal British subject who has lived in, and loved, Ireland for more than 60 years,” he wrote in the piece, headlined ‘Bought by Brussels, little Ireland’s ridiculous leaders have landed it in a Brexit crisis’. “What is tough is watching the ridiculous behaviour of the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his foreign minister, Simon Coveney, trying to destroy, like wilful children, relations with an ancient and friendly neighbour.“Whatever faults the British may have, they understand independence and freedom. I can understand why they mock the ridiculous behaviour of these two men.“Varadkar and Coveney are both members of Fine Gael, a party that has its roots in the fight 100 years ago to secure independence and freedom for Ireland. Yet now here they are trying to block the UK’s path to the same independence and freedom.”He described this approach as “painful and embarrassing stuff”, and was highly critical of the EU’s treatment of the UK.“It was bad enough these past months having to witness the humiliations of the journeys to Brussels of prime minister Theresa May,” he said. “Begging at the European Commission and European Council brought her nothing.“One cannot be surprised that Boris Johnson is so far refusing to go to Brussels. He is smart enough not to hazard a rerun of Theresa May’s ill-judged visits to the groups that became her tormentors. “The European Parliament had a brief walk-on part in the humiliations – to approve the draft agreement. They seemed from time to time to be sniggering behind their hands at this unfortunate woman who was betrayed on all sides.”‘Cheerleaders’ Arnold, who has written for several newspapers including The , the Irish Press, the Sunday Independent, and the , accused Dublin of acting as “cheerleader for these tormentors”.“Yet their cheerleading operates in terms that make no sense at all,” he said. “Varadkar and Coveney are increasingly uncertain fools. Their desire to be players in a game they don’t understand is causing their clothing to unravel and their minds to lose their way.“Their determination to work against the UK’s desire for a smooth and prosperous Brexit will in the end leave Ireland diplomatically estranged from its most important trade and political partner.“With some satisfaction I see that public opinion in Ireland is at last questioning their policies.” Arnold, who was awarded an OBE in 2003 “for services to Irish journalism and Anglo-Irish relations”, said Brussels was using the “iel-like euro-eagerness” of the Government “for its own ends”.He added: “Once Brussels gets what it wants, it will dump all interest in Irish concerns.“What Varadkar and Coveney are doing is helping Brussels to block the path for the UK government to implement the democratic decision of the British people to leave the EU. There was a referendum. The people gave their decision.“And yet a Dublin government which brags that it is republican and democratic denigrates this decision as populism. It colludes with the EU to try to have the decision dismissed and resisted.” Arnold’s article in the Daily , which is a Eurosceptic, pro-Brexit, and Tory-leaning publication, was also critical of the Republic’s decision to rerun referendums to ratify the Nice Treaty in 2002 and the Lisbon Treaty seven years later.He described the Lisbon Treaty as “a camouflaged EU constitution which would dissolve their republic into a new supranational state”. The Irish constitution, he said, “is now no more than a worthless gathering of sad memories”.“If you want to understand Varadkar and Coveney’s behaviour, the Lisbon sell-out is the key,” he continued. “Irish politicians are honest: when they are bought, they stay bought. “These uncertain fools have now led Ireland to be engulfed in a crisis as Boris Johnson, the new prime minister, seeks to lead Britain out of the EU either before or after an election.“Yet again we face a crisis of democracy, with little Ireland and the huge EU refusing to recognise the democratic decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. The ridiculous country in which I live is helping Europe in this abuse.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

And Twitch, like all apps that allow two-way communication and live streaming, present particular risks to children of being groomed.“These sites need to ensure they are doing everything they can to protect children on their platforms.A Twitch spokesman said: The safety of our community is a top priority and one in which we are perpetually investing.We take any issues or accusations of this nature extremely seriously, and as soon as we become aware of a possible instance of exploitation we swiftly take the content down and report it to relevant law enforcement as appropriate.  The NSPCC’s warning comes as it released the results of a survey of 2,000 11 to 17-year-olds that found one in 25 has received or been asked to send sexual material to an adult online.When compared to the population of more than five million children in the UK of that age, the NSPCC estimates this means up to 201,000 are being subject to attempted grooming. According to the survey, the most common social media sites where children experienced grooming were Snapchat and Facebook, where one in 25 using those networks said they had received such requests.The second most common sites were Twitch and Twitter, with one in 33 reporting having such experiences.As a result, the charity called called for social media and tech companies to share more data with each help catch groomers and disable friend suggestion algorithms for children.Duty of Care campaign | Read morePeter Wanless, NSPCC Chief Executive, said: “The scale of risk that children face on social networks revealed in this research cannot be ignored and tackling it with robust and comprehensive legislation needs to be a priority for this government.   “Tech firms need to be forced to get a grip of the abuse taking place on their sites by using technology to identify suspicious behaviour and designing young people’s accounts with built-in protections.”Following the findings, Antigone Davis, Facebook Head of Global Safety, said: “Keeping young people safe on our platforms is a top priority for us.“In addition to using technology to proactively detect grooming and prevent child sexual exploitation on our platform, we work with child protection experts, including specialist law enforcement teams like CEOP in the UK, to keep young people safe.“Ninety nine percent of child nudity content is removed from our platform automatically.”A spokesman for Snapchat added: “We are concerned that predators are using other, less private, apps to locate potential victims and then steer them to Snapchat or other private messaging platforms. We are working hard to better understand this activity and are collaborating with law enforcement and other industry partners to develop more ways to combat this behaviour.”A spokesman for Twitter said: “Twitter does not tolerate any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation. Under our child sexual exploitation policy, behaviours such as expressing a desire to obtain materials that feature child sexual exploitation as well as engaging or trying to engage a child in a sexually explicit conversation, are in violation. “We continue to welcome partnerships around the world with law enforcement to continue our rigorous and significantly scaled operations on this type of egregious activity.”Duty of Care CampaignThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

So please, no gifts and no pressure. But if you feel so inclined, we welcome putting on the best party ever for our family and friends,” the couple wrote on a specially set-up website.“Instead of a traditional registry, we’re accepting donations towards the cost of the wedding.”Knox posted this image of herself shortly before traveling to Italy to talk about the Kercher murder and miscarriages of justicePeople who donate will receive a “signed, limited edition” of a joint book of love poems which the couple have called The Cardio Tesseract.They said they had spent all their wedding funds on a trip to Italy in June, when Knox spoke about the murder and her initial conviction at a conference on miscarriages of justice in the city of Modena.But it has now emerged that the couple are already married, having tied the knot in secret in December.Records from King County, Washington State, show that they made a marriage application on Nov 21 last year, and were officially married on December 7.Knox and her fiancé put out a statement on Thursday in response to criticism that they had misled friends, family and supporters.They admitted that they were already married.“We filed paperwork to be legally married in December of last year to simplify our taxes and insurance,” the wrote.They said the event in February would be a celebration of the wedding “with our loved ones”.Meredith Kercher was murdered in Perugia, Umbria, in a house she shared with Amanda KnoxKnox also admitted that she had received significant financial help to attend the event in Modena by an NGO called the Italy Innocence Project.But she said she had still spent $10,000 on security measures, travel expenses for her mother and flights.“The trip was a financial setback for us and we were forced to use funds we’d been saving for our wedding.”The space-age theme of the wedding promises, according to Knox and her boyfriend, “Vikings drinking pan-galactic gargle blasters, mutants schmoozing with Grecian queens and cyborgs.”The couple promise their guests “outrageous costumes, crazier puzzles, mind-bending sets and extravagant alien food.”Ms Kercher, from Surrey, was 21 when she was found dead with her throat cut in the cottage she shared with Knox and two Italian women in Perugia, a hill-town in Umbria that is popular with foreign students.A local drifter named Rudy Guede was tried, convicted and sentenced to 16 years in jail for the murder, with DNA evidence linking him to the sexual assault and killing of Ms Kercher.Knox posted photos of herself dressed as Little Red Riding Hood on social mediaBut suspicion also fell on Knox and her then boyfriend, Italian student Raffaele Sollecito – prosecutors said they had acted with Guede, knifing Ms Kercher to death after a sex game turned violent.They were convicted and sentenced to 26 years in prison.The convictions were overturned in 2011 and Knox immediately returned to the US.In her absence, the acquittals were thrown out by an Italian appeals court, before being upheld by the supreme court in Rome in 2015, when Knox and Sollecito were definitively cleared of the crimes.Knox broke down in tears on stage in Modena when she recounted the murder and her subsequent imprisonment.“The truth is that Raffaele and I did not kill Meredith,” she told the audience. “I had zero motivation to kill my friend.” She said she had been cast as a “dirty, psychopathic, man-eating whore.”Whaley Bridge dam collapse: Derbyshire town evacuated amid fears flooding could cause dam to burstComment: Nothing exemplifies the BBC\u0026#39s complacency

she has returned to the bosom of her Jordanian family. The 45-year-old mother fled with her children from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where she lived with the sheikh, the country’s vice-president and prime minister, apparently “in fear for her life” in April.The estranged and sixth wife of Sheikh Matktoum, 70, has asked a judge in the High Court to make an arranged marriage protection order for one of her children, as well as a non-molestation order. The sheikh, who founded the Godolphin stables and is a friend of the Queen, has applied to the courts for the “summary return” of the youngsters to the UAE.Princess Haya Bint al-Hussein ( wearing white), arrives at the High Court in London this week with lawyer Baroness ShackletonThis latest picture has fueled speculation in the Middle East that the break-up could trigger a diplomatic crisis between the UAE and Jordan. Meanwhile, the fact courts from a third country - Britain - are ruling on what’s best for children belonging to the royal families of two different foreign countries is unprecedented. Some experts say it puts Britain in an awkward position because it tests loyalties to two of its most important Middle East allies.“British courts are absolutely independent and impartial, and will consider this case with the same objectivity as they would in any other,” Radha Stirling, CEO of Detained in Dubai, said. “Having said that, I do believe such a sensitive case, with implications that could impact the UK’s foreign relations in the region, and the reputations of two royal families, would be better handled privately.”While Jordan has made no official mention of the hearing, the case has been widely discussed by nationals of both countries on social media.Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a prominent Emirati political scientist, wrote this week on Twitter: “A sensible and respectable princess of strong lineage does not flee, kidnap, disappear or show ingratitude, and certainly does not trouble the spirit of someone who cherished, loved and provided for her and treated her with dignity.” The message came after the sheikh himself posted a cryptic poem about deceit on online and another about the UAE’s “shining sword” that would protect it from foes.Qusai Zreiqat, a Jordanian, posted: “She is a daughter of a king, a granddaughter of a king and a sister of a king before there was a country called the Emirates.”Comment: Mark Carney should be getting Britain ready for no deal, not wallowing in Brexit gloomWhaley Bridge dam collapse: Derbyshire town evacuated amid fears flooding could cause dam to burstPrisoners to be allowed to vote in Scottish election this month despite MSPs having yet to back changeComment: No Deal has become a revenge tool in the stand-off between somewheres and anywheresLaw which allows women to find out about partners\u0026#39 abusive past is too slow, say family as it emerges murder victim requested information 11 days before she was killedHarvey Proctor urges Labour to suspend Tom Watson over Operation Midland roleBrecon by-election result: what will it mean for Brexit, and when will it be announced?Hamza bin Laden\u0026#39s death \u0026#39only symbolic blow to al-Qaeda\u0026#39Two charged with murder over death of woman on ShetlandNumber of missing dogs in Tamworth grows to six, as pug of pet-sitter at the centre of mystery also disappearsPrince Harry delivers \u0026#39barefoot speech on saving the planet\u0026#39 at top-secret elite Google CampCollapse of nuclear arms control treaty stokes fears of escalationComment: \u0026#34Smaller families won’t save the planet,\u0026#34 IEA Fellow warnsBrexit latest news: Boris Johnson chairs first no-deal war cabinet as he faces first electoral testChildren\u0026#39s special needs care closes and staff suspended amid allegations of child crueltyRussia engineers climate to induce rain as wildfires rage across SiberiaUniversities which fail to recruit poor students will have fees cut by the watchdog, under new powersSardinia re-homes sand taken from its beaches by pilfering touristsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/01/10/gettyimages-585196764.jpg","title":"bbc iplayer 30 day availability episodes change netflix","story":"IM Subscribe NowIM Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.IM  Subscribe NowIM  Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 1 monthSee the optionsThe BBC had earlier this year petitioned Ofcom to allow the changes to happen so as to protect the corporation’s futureClick to followThe Independent CultureBBC iPlayer will soon allow viewers to watch inidual episodes of its content for an entire year, rather than just 30 days, in the corporation’s latest attempt to compete with Netflix.In a statement by Ofcom, the communications regulator has announced that “the BBC can go ahead with planned changes to BBC iPlayer, subject to certain conditions and guidance”.\u0026nbspIt continues: “The BBC intends to change BBC iPlayer from a 30-day catch-up service, to one where programmes are available for 12 months as standard, with some available for longer.”The statement adds that Ofcom undertook a BBC Competition Assessment before allowing the corporation to go ahead with their plans.Created with Sketch.Hidden gems: The best Netflix originals you might have missed Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

Today, iPlayer’s share of the market has slumped to just 15 per cent.In a statement at the time, the BBC said that they had no expectation of triumphing over Netflix, but that allowing their content to stay on iPlayer for a lengthy period of time would “simply allow the BBC to stop the continued decline we expect to see over the next five years,” adding that lack of change would “threaten the BBC’s very ability to deliver its mission to serve all audiences and provide viewers with value for their licence fee”.Why Netflix should be seriously concerned about its latest figures Netflix sees $18bn wiped off stock market value as subscribers leaveBBC iPlayer reveals its most popular shows of 2018It is no doubt a move inspired by\u0026nbspnew streaming television service BritBox, which is\u0026nbspa joint venture between the BBC and ITV.An existing BritBox service already exists on a modest scale in America, with half a million subscribers.

The sales of iPhones took a 12 per cent tumble and the company’s earnings fell by a similar amount. Yet the shares jumped in after-hours trading.\u0026nbspAs ever, this was partly down to expectations: Wall Street had forecast a deeper e.\u0026nbspThe markets were also buoyed by what chief\u0026nbspexecutive Tim Cook had to say about the future, with new iPhone models on the way, together with his talk about a “marked improvement” in China.\u0026nbspTrump attacks Apple’s plea for tariff waivers on new Mac Pro partsApple buys Intel 5G modem business, dropping major hint at new iPhoneNew iPhone line-up said to be revealed in huge new leakBut with this latest set of figures, the company also crossed a rubicon. Its signature product, for the first time in years, provided\u0026nbspless than half the firm’s revenues in a three-month quarter. The latest covered\u0026nbspthe period up to 29 June. It is\u0026nbspthe third of Apple’s financial year and in it the iPhone accounted for 48 per cent, compared to 55 per cent over the same period in 2018.\u0026nbspIts dwindling sales might have been taken more seriously but for the fact that they were more than offset by growth in other areas, helping Apple to post a modest increase in overall revenues – $53.8bn (£44.1bn) against $53.3bn last time.\u0026nbspThe boom in Apple services –\u0026nbspincluding music subscriptions, the App Store, Apple Pay, and Apple TV –\u0026nbsphas been a longstanding theme, and that continued.\u0026nbspMore than 400 million people now have some sort of subscription with the company. It will hope to add to their number through Apple TV+, a new streaming service coming in the autumn, although it is entering an increasingly crowded field at a time when even the mighty Netflix is starting to encounter some price resistance, at least in North America.But that’s far from the only new string being added to the company’s bow. A credit card is coming in August too. It’s not only Amazon that could easily be renamed World Domination Enterprises. Apple is also sending its tanks out to occupy an ever-growing number of lawns and causing shivers down the spines of an ever-growing number of competitors.\u0026nbspDespite all this activity, services didn’t even make the biggest noise in this\u0026nbspset of results, as they have become accustomed to doing. Nor did\u0026nbspMacs or iPads, both of which grew handily. The unit shouting loudest was, in fact, “Wearables, Home and\u0026nbspAccessories” which recorded growth of 48 per cent.\u0026nbspThis is made up of a rag bag of different product lines including smart speakers, headphones, and especially the Apple Watch, which has started to come (very) good for the company after a decidedly rocky start.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

As the port with the\u0026nbspshortest distance to Northern Ireland,\u0026nbspthe harbour had once been the lifeblood of the village. Long before email, 10,000 mail packets made their way from Portpatrick and across the sea to Donaghadee.\u0026nbspThe railway came to Portpatrick in 1862, shortly before the cross-channel steamer services moved to nearby Stranraer. When the government switched the mail service to Stranraer, passengers on the railway between the two villages dwindled, and Portpatrick harbour became the preserve for a small fleet of fishermen and some pleasure boats.\u0026nbspHow the look of council estates has changed over a centuryLabour vows to end ‘rip-off’ by ensuring councils take back servicesThird of councils fear they will be unable to provide vital services“Steam killed the village for sailboats coming in,” Robert Erskine, a lifeboat coxswain since 1984, told me in 2016. “It’s now more a leisure harbour. But it’s still very important as it’s the centrepoint of the village.”I was in Portpatrick to report on a\u0026nbsphistoric moment for residents. In 2015, frustrated at the lack of maintenance by the harbour’s private owners, local people made the decision to organise as a community benefit society, an organisation accountable to the community, and sell shares to buy their harbour and secure the village’s future.\u0026nbspThree and a half years later, the community-owned harbour has catalysed the regeneration\u0026nbspof several other buildings in the village. The society has acquired a row of toilets and a patch of land near the harbour from Dumfries and Galloway council, at a price of £1, to save the facility from closure. Two people have been employed directly by the society to service the toilets.\u0026nbspThe society has now applied to transfer the local village hall into community ownership under the Communities Empowerment Act Scotland 2015.“People are coming to the village and making the comment that they can see the changes,” says Calum Currie, chair of the Portpatrick\u0026nbspCommunity Benefit Society. “The harbour is much busier. We have now made the harbour a venue from which we’re looking at doing more festivals and events.”In England, there are more than 6,300 assets like the Portpatrick harbour\u0026nbspin community ownership, according to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government and Power to Change. These community halls, sports centres, parks and other spaces contribute nearly £220m to the UK economy every year, its research shows.Three-quarters of these assets are reported to be in good financial health. And the sector is growing: one third of the\u0026nbspassets came into community ownership in the last year.“This is a surprisingly good story,” says Ailbhe McNabola, head of\u0026nbspresearch\u0026nbspat Power to Change. “The proportion of assets in good financial health is really promising. Councils are under huge pressure financially, but with the assets they can dispose of, they are thinking about the community first and how they can continue to provide access.”\u0026nbspUnder the Localism Act of 2011, community organisations have the right to delay the sale of a building or land so that they can develop a bid. They might also register the building or space as an “asset of community value” in order to be alerted if the asset comes up for sale. In Scotland, the government has conferred additional rights to community groups to buy large landholdings and estates through a Right to Buy, which enables the forced disposal of a property if it is abandoned, neglected or detrimental in some way.Eighty per cent of the assets transferred into community ownership are community centres such as village halls. When these are taken out of the equation, the rate of community asset transfer for other assets such as sports centres, parks, open space and libraries is increasing even faster, McNabola says.\u0026nbspIn Wolverhampton, the council has given a longterm lease for a piece of land and stadium to Bilston Town Community Football Club, giving it ownership over an asset that has helped the club survive during a difficult financial period. In Liverpool, a piece of neglected local authority land was sold to Squash, a community food initiative, and is now occupied by modern cafe, gallery and gardens. Meanwhile in Dauntsey Lock, Wiltshire, residents registered a local pub, The Peterborough Arms, as an asset of community value to give them the time to raise £225,000 to buy it from private owners who wanted to turn it into residential property.“It’s a combination of a good policy environment, which has raised the profile of community asset transfers, and austerity, where councils have had their budgets cut are not able to maintain buildings in the way they once did,” McNabola\u0026nbspsays. She notes the\u0026nbspexample of community-run libraries, which have grown from very small numbers to an estimated 500 in England by the end of 2018.These community asset transfers are part of a much broader picture of councils selling assets to stay in the black as their grant from the central government has shrunk by 60 per cent since 2010. In March, an investigation by the Bureau Local and Huffington Post revealed that local authorities have sold more than 12,000 public spaces since 2014-15.\u0026nbspBut McNabola\u0026nbspsays that when asset transfers are done well, everyone benefits. “You have to make sure that the assets handed over are not a liability and that councils are working with communities in a sustainable way,” she says. “A council should be there to help with the self-realisation of the community, not to make money.”\u0026nbspThe transition from owning a community asset to doing buildings and facilities management can be a challenge for community organisations. “It’s about engaging with the community early on, thinking about governance and making sure the group has the support they need,” McNabola\u0026nbspsays.Austerity-hit councils in \u0027Great British selloff\u0027 of public buildingsDumfries and Galloway Council says that its approach to community asset transfer is to support communities to develop their ideas to deliver services with and for the local community. “At a time of austerity, when councils cannot deliver all of the traditional services, we work with communities to help them realise their ambitions and provide local solutions to local issues,” a spokesperson said. The council noted that it only transfers a property when it can be assured that the business plan is supported by the local community and able to generate a sustainable income.Currie believes the Portpatrick\u0026nbspHarbour Community Benefit Society now has\u0026nbspa stable of assets that will support its acquisition of the village hall – and help them break even in the first year.\u0026nbsp“For a community group to take on a village hall takes a lot of planning and involvement,” he says. “But we have the support of the village.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

compared with the price cap average of £1,254.Suppliers who claim to offer “100 per cent\u0026nbspgreen” energy tend to buy the majority of their electricity on wholesale markets, then buy certificates called “REGOs”, which guarantee the equal amount of electricity created from fossil fuels is matched by renewable generation.However, Good Energy uses power purchase agreements, which involve buying electricity directly from wind farm and solar generators.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.Founder and chief executive of Good Energy, Juliet Davenport, said: “Our tariffs genuinely support the growth of renewables and clean technologies. And because our customers have actively chosen to contribute to that support.“If we are going to tackle climate breakdown, iniduals must be empowered to choose to be part of the solution. We know customers want the ability to make that choice, and recently it has been complicated by energy companies taking shortcuts to offer cheap \u0027green\u0027 tariffs.”Regulator Ofgem had initially given Good Energy a temporary exemption in January when the cap was introduced. This lasted until the end of March, but was extended until September, and was finally made permanent.Ofgem said the decision was made because it recognised customers on Good Energy\u0027s standard variable tariff (SVT) had chosen to be on it, unlike customers who have been on SVTs for several years without necessarily knowing.Officials added that the support for renewables provided by the extra cash is “materially greater” than “regulatory mechanisms”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Manufacturing has now shrank for three consecutive months. The last time managers reported weaker activity was in February 2013.Production volumes hit a seven-year low, dragged down partly because manufacturers sold off stocks built up to prepare for the Brexit deadline of 31 March, said IHS Markit which compiled the data.While some firms were still running down stocks bolstered before\u0026nbspthe original Brexit date, others were re-starting these stockpiling efforts in preparation for the new October deadline, IHS Markit said.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply, said: A killer combination of economic uncertainty and the weakest production levels for seven years, battered the manufacturing sector into contraction for the third consecutive month in July.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

The decline in new export business mainly reflected lower intakes from the EU and China.The latest\u0026nbspgrim indicator for the UK economy came as Boris Johnson stepped up plans for a no-deal Brexit widely expected to cause significant disruption to businesses and consumers.UK manufacturing output and optimism tumble to multi-year lows – CBIHowever, manufacturers maintained a positive outlook in July with more than 46 per cent expecting output to be higher in a years\u0027 time than it is now, compared to just 10 per cent predicting output will be lower.Managers pointed to new product launches, an expected rebound in exports and reduced uncertainty following Brexit\u0026nbspas reasons to be optimistic.Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit said manufacturers were suffocating under the choke-hold of slower global growth and political uncertainty.“The weak, highly competitive environment makes a sustained revival highly unlikely in the coming months.However, a short-lived bounce leading up to October should not be ruled out, as some manufacturers are already gearing up to re-start Brexit preparations.If so, expect a case of déjà-vu during quarter four, as another correction in inventory holdings hits growth in the lead-up to year-end.The pound sank to a two-and-a-half year low against the dollar on Tuesday.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Such has been his support for Saudi Arabia and the young royal, Mr Trump has vetoed resolutions that would have stopped US support for the kingdom\u0027s war against rebels in Yemen, an operation that has resulted in the deaths of thousands of civilians and triggered a humanitarian catastrophe.\u0026nbspHowever, last year it was reported the CIA had concluded the 33-year-old prince has ordered the assassination of the journalist, who was killed after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to apply for a visa. In June, a report by Agnes Callamard, special rapporteur for the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, said the prince should be investigated over the death as there was “credible evidence” linking him and other senior officials to the murder.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

compared with the price cap average of £1,254.Suppliers who claim to offer “100 per cent\u0026nbspgreen” energy tend to buy the majority of their electricity on wholesale markets, then buy certificates called “REGOs”, which guarantee the equal amount of electricity created from fossil fuels is matched by renewable generation.However, Good Energy uses power purchase agreements, which involve buying electricity directly from wind farm and solar generators.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.Founder and chief executive of Good Energy, Juliet Davenport, said: “Our tariffs genuinely support the growth of renewables and clean technologies. And because our customers have actively chosen to contribute to that support.“If we are going to tackle climate breakdown, iniduals must be empowered to choose to be part of the solution. We know customers want the ability to make that choice, and recently it has been complicated by energy companies taking shortcuts to offer cheap \u0027green\u0027 tariffs.”Regulator Ofgem had initially given Good Energy a temporary exemption in January when the cap was introduced. This lasted until the end of March, but was extended until September, and was finally made permanent.Ofgem said the decision was made because it recognised customers on Good Energy\u0027s standard variable tariff (SVT) had chosen to be on it, unlike customers who have been on SVTs for several years without necessarily knowing.Officials added that the support for renewables provided by the extra cash is “materially greater” than “regulatory mechanisms”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The birth rate was the lowest ever recorded, when births are measured as a proportion of the total population.“The total fertility rate stood at 1.7 children per woman, lower than all years except 1977 and 1999 to 2002.“The proportion of live births to non-UK mothers fell for the first time since 1990. The stillbirth rate reached the lowest level recorded for the second year running.“There were 657,076 live births last year, the fewest since 2005 and a drop of almost 10 per cent\u0026nbspsince 2012.”Clea Harmer, chief executive at stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands, said: “This continuing downward trend in the deaths of babies before birth is very welcome but, until the figures can be seen alongside mortality rates for babies who die shortly after birth, it is too early to comment on whether we are on track to meet the English government’s ambition to halve deaths by 2025.”Additional reporting by PA\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Together the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionist Party will hold 321 seats, while other parties and independent MPs will hold the other 320.The position isn’t quite as precarious for the new prime minister as it seems, however. In most cases, Johnson will be able to rely on the support of Charlie Elphicke, the MP for Dover, who had the Tory whip removed this month when he was charged with sexual assault, an accusation he denies.\u0026nbspThe reason Jeremy Corbyn held back from tabling a motion of no confidence in Johnson’s government last week was that it was certain to be defeated: in addition to Elphicke, Sylvia Hermon, the independent unionist MP, voted with Theresa May in the last vote of no confidence in January, and Ivan Lewis and John Woodcock, former Labour MPs, abstained.\u0026nbspYet the arithmetic of a future vote of no confidence, if it were designed to stop Johnson pursuing a no-deal Brexit, is unpredictable, and every single vote could count.\u0026nbspIf Jane Dodds, the Liberal Democrat candidate and the party’s leader in Wales, wins the by-election, it will tilt the balance in the House of Commons a bit further against a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Boris Johnson\u0027s cabinet: Who\u0027s in and who\u0027s out Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jacob Rees Mogg appointed Leader of the CommonsJo Johnson appointed new business and energy secretaryBaroness Evans remains Leader of LordsAmber Rudd remains work and pensions secretaryRobert Jenrick appointed housing and communities secretaryMichael Gove given Chandellor of the Duchy of LancasterSajid Javid  is appointed Chancellor of the ExchequerJeremy Hunt sacked as foreign secretaryChris Grayling resigned as transport secretaryJeremy Wright sacked as culture secretaryKaren Bradley sacked as Northern Ireland secretaryJames Brokenshire sacked as housing and communities secretaryPenny Mourdaunt sacked as defence secretaryLiam Fox sacked as international trade secretaryGreg Clarke sacked as business secretaryDavid Mundell sacked as Scottish secretaryDamien Hinds sacked as education secretaryDavid Gauke resigned as justice secretaryRory Stewart resigned as international development secretaryDavid Lidlington resigned as deputy Prime MinisterPhilip Hammond resigned as Chancellor of the ExchequerJacob Rees Mogg appointed Leader of the CommonsJo Johnson appointed new business and energy secretaryBaroness Evans remains Leader of LordsAmber Rudd remains work and pensions secretaryRobert Jenrick appointed housing and communities secretaryMichael Gove given Chandellor of the Duchy of LancasterSajid Javid  is appointed Chancellor of the ExchequerJeremy Hunt sacked as foreign secretaryChris Grayling resigned as transport secretaryJeremy Wright sacked as culture secretaryKaren Bradley sacked as Northern Ireland secretaryJames Brokenshire sacked as housing and communities secretaryPenny Mourdaunt sacked as defence secretaryLiam Fox sacked as international trade secretaryGreg Clarke sacked as business secretaryDavid Mundell sacked as Scottish secretaryDamien Hinds sacked as education secretaryDavid Gauke resigned as justice secretaryRory Stewart resigned as international development secretaryDavid Lidlington resigned as deputy Prime MinisterPhilip Hammond resigned as Chancellor of the ExchequerSo what is going to happen? Only one opinion poll has been carried out in the constituency, by Number Cruncher Politics, which put Dodds on 43 per cent, 15 points ahead of Chris Davies, the Tory candidate, whose conviction for expenses fraud caused the by-election.\u0026nbspDes Parkinson, the Brexit Party candidate, was in third place on 20 per cent, with Labour’s Tom Davies trailing on 8 per cent.\u0026nbspBut that poll was carried out between 10 and 18 July, a week before Johnson became prime minister, so it is possible that Davies might benefit from the national “Boris bounce” in the Tories’ favour. In national opinion polls there has been a shift of about 5 per cent of voters from the Brexit Party to the Tories. That is not going to be enough to hold the seat, which makes the Tories’ decision to allow Davies to stand again – after he was dismissed by a petition signed by 19 per cent of his constituents – all the more curious.\u0026nbspWhat does the Remain parties’ pact for the Brecon by-election mean?The by-election has also been hailed as a test of a common front among the Remain parties, because Plaid Cymru and the Green Party decided stand aside to give the Lib Dems a free run. As Plaid Cymru won a mere three\u0026nbspper cent of the vote in the 2017 election, and the Greens didn’t have a candidate, this wasn’t such a great sacrifice – and in any case the Lib Dems were well placed to contest the seat, having held it between 1997 and 2015.\u0026nbspAll the same, a Lib Dem win today will be a small but significant gain for Remainers, and and for all opponents of a no-deal Brexit, despite the constituency having voted, in line with the nation as a whole,\u0026nbspby 52 per cent to leave the EU in the referendum.brecon and radnorshire by-election\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Manufacturing has now shrank for three consecutive months. The last time managers reported weaker activity was in February 2013.Production volumes hit a seven-year low, dragged down partly because manufacturers sold off stocks built up to prepare for the Brexit deadline of 31 March, said IHS Markit which compiled the data.While some firms were still running down stocks bolstered before\u0026nbspthe original Brexit date, others were re-starting these stockpiling efforts in preparation for the new October deadline, IHS Markit said.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply, said: A killer combination of economic uncertainty and the weakest production levels for seven years, battered the manufacturing sector into contraction for the third consecutive month in July.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

The debate deepened after reports a video had been filmed by private investigators of sex acts taking place in the clubNew orders fell as businesses used up stockpiled materials, EU businesses moved supply chains out of the UK and weakness in the global economy stifled demand from both domestic and export markets.Unsurprisingly the decline in employment levels followed suit with one of the sharpest cuts to jobs for more than six years as businesses hesitated to keep calm and carry on and build staff levels.Employment in manufacturing decreased for the fourth month in a row, with the pace of decline accelerating to one of the highest over the past six-and-a-half years.Demand was weaker from domestic and overseas markets. The decline in new export business mainly reflected lower intakes from the EU and China.The latest\u0026nbspgrim indicator for the UK economy came as Boris Johnson stepped up plans for a no-deal Brexit widely expected to cause significant disruption to businesses and consumers.UK manufacturing output and optimism tumble to multi-year lows – CBIHowever, manufacturers maintained a positive outlook in July with more than 46 per cent expecting output to be higher in a years\u0027 time than it is now, compared to just 10 per cent predicting output will be lower.Managers pointed to new product launches, an expected rebound in exports and reduced uncertainty following Brexit\u0026nbspas reasons to be optimistic.Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit said manufacturers were suffocating under the choke-hold of slower global growth and political uncertainty.“The weak, highly competitive environment makes a sustained revival highly unlikely in the coming months.However, a short-lived bounce leading up to October should not be ruled out, as some manufacturers are already gearing up to re-start Brexit preparations.If so, expect a case of déjà-vu during quarter four, as another correction in inventory holdings hits growth in the lead-up to year-end.The pound sank to a two-and-a-half year low against the dollar on Tuesday.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But both in word and manner, he was not even close to convincing, and will remain vulnerable to fresh assaults from the likes of Elizabeth Warren when candidates appear at the third debate in Houston in September.“Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. We have to let him know who we are. We choose science over fiction. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over ision,” Mr Biden said in his closing remarks. “And we choose, we choose the idea that we can as Americans, when we act together, do anything.”At the first debate in Miami, Mr Biden’s main assault came from Ms Harris.

(It probably did not help\u0026nbspthat he started the night by telling Ms Harris: Go easy on me kid!)He was challenged by senator Kirsten Gillibrand over an article he wrote in 1981 suggesting women should not work outside the home. He was questioned by Ms Harris over his support, until recently, for a piece of Republican-created legislation that prevents the use of federal funds to pay for abortions.He was attacked too, by Cory Booker, the senator from New Jersey who spoke both fluidly and concisely, managed to express genuine warmth, and was generally reckoned to have been among the best of the 10 candidates debating last night.“We have a real crisis in our country, and the crisis is Donald Trump — but not only Donald Trump, I have a frustration that sometimes people are saying the only thing they want is to beat Donald Trump,” Mr Booker said. “Well, that is the floor and not the ceiling.”Biden struggles to explain op-ed saying \u0027women should not be working outside of the home\u0027Mr Biden, who frequently flailed, and repeatedly referred to things he had done as vice president to Barack Obama - a reminder to many that he represented the past but not necessarily the future -\u0026nbspwas not the only one to be challenged on stage.Ms Harris, 53, who had entered the night in fourth place in most polls, was attacked several times over her mixed record as a prosecutor in California, where she has faced criticism for supporting “tough on crime” type policies. While she declined to pursue the death penalty against a man convicted of killing a police officer, for instance, she did defend the state\u0027s death penalty system in court. Her performance on Wednesday was solid, but as with Mr Biden, it paled when compared to the way progressives Bernie Sanders and Ms Warren stole the night just 24 hours earlierAmong the most powerful attacks against her came from congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, of Hawaii.“Senator Harris says she\u0027s proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she\u0027ll be a prosecutor president, but I\u0027m deeply concerned about this record,” she said. “There are too many examples to cite but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.”She added: “The bottom line is, Senator Harris, when you were in a position to make a difference and impact in these people\u0027s lives, you did not.”Among the other candidates, Washington governor Jay Inslee made a passionate case that climate change was the most important challenge facing the\u0026nbspUS, and the world. \u0026nbspBiden struggles to explain saying \u0027women should not work outside home\u0027Joe Biden needs to withdraw- the latest Democratic debate proved thatWho won and who lost the Democratic debate?Democratic debate interrupted by hecklers shouting about immigrationJoe Biden heard on hot mic asking Harris to \u0027go easy\u0027 before debate“We have one last chance. When you have one chance in life, you take it. Think about this. Literally the survival of humanity on this planet in civilization is in the hands of the next president,” said Mr Inslee, one of many of the 20 candidates who appeared over two nights\u0026nbspin Michigan hoping they did enough to qualify for the third debate in Texas.The Democratic National Committee has said it will double the qualification standards for the third debate, an attempt to thin out the crowded field. Mr Biden will certainly be there. But his performance tonight has ensured that\u0026nbsphe will again be the one his rivals will turn on.The great unknowable question is how badly these attacks damage him in the eyes of voters. After the first debate, he saw his lead slip by up to 10 points, but it had almost recovered by the time he travelled to Detroit.\u0026nbspThe challenge for Mr Biden, who did not look happy the entire night, may be less his polling numbers, rather than whether he can persuade major Democratic donors and grassroots activists that he is the man to get behind in 2020. On that question, Mr Biden still has a mountain to climb.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He then disappeared for a while, before coming back to hit\u0026nbspJoe\u0026nbspBiden\u0026nbsprepeatedly over criminal justice reform with some choice language. Booker showed none of the deference you’d expect\u0026nbspfrom a young senator to a veteran politico who served eight years as vice president – at one point dismissing Biden’s “phony rhetoric” – but that ruthlessness made his performance all the more memorable.This wasn’t in the same ballpark as her\u0026nbspperformance in the first debate, where she confronted Biden over bussing. But, after a shaky start where she sounded flustered by Biden’s energetic opening, she regained her footing. There was one uncomfortable moment\u0026nbspwhen\u0026nbspTulsi Gabbard\u0026nbspquestioned\u0026nbspher record as a prosecutor – but she didn’t fold. She’ll mark this debate as a net positive.All polling numbers suggest he’s got zero shot at winning this thing. He’s even widely\u0026nbspdisliked in his own city. But his undisputed strength is in debating. The most striking moment for him came\u0026nbspwhen he\u0026nbspasked Biden whether he tried to slow the number of deportations when he was vice president.“You want to be president of the United States, you need to be able to answer the tough questions,” De Blasio said to Biden. “I guarantee you, if you’re debating Donald Trump, he’s not going to let you off the hook.”After a quiet first half, she managed to hit\u0026nbspHarris harder than Biden did at any point in the evening by pinning her down on her record as California’s attorney general.\u0026nbspIt’s a very fertile line of attack for progressives, though, and Harris knows this. She was prepared, but it was an uncomfortable moment for her.She also used her clout garnered from two tours of duty in the Middle East to good effect, saying: For too long we had leaders who have been arbitrating foreign policy from ivory towers in Washington without any idea about the cost and the consequence the toll it takes on our service members.”He was hit from every angle and simply didn’t appear to have the agility to deal with it. He started off with spark when challenged on his healthcare plans, but fell back to his typical mumbles and stumbles under pressure later in the debate. While Harris converted jibes from the sidelines into jabs at her main rival, Biden found himself becoming the punching bag of everyone from Booker to De Blasio. He was, on more than one occasion, happy to immediately stop speaking when moderators asked him to finish his answer, which is generally the sign of a politician in trouble.She had one of the more memorable lines of the night (promising to deep clean the Oval Office if she became president), but failed to make a significant overall impact. At one point, she appeared to be so caught off-guard\u0026nbspby being called upon by moderators that there an awkward pause of several seconds as she gathered her thoughts. Unluckily for her, when she was getting into her stride on gender equality, the moderators cut her off.He looked like a deer in the headlights in the first debate, and needed a breakout moment on Wednesday night. Repeatedly banging the drum for his $1,000-a-month guaranteed income plan wasn’t close to enough.Considering he’s a rank outsider in the race, with little name recognition, he got a lot of face-time with the American public. He seemed to chip in on almost every exchange for an extended period of time – with his hand in the air like the earnest know-it-all at the front of the classroom. But none of the interventions felt significant enough to cut through at home.Strong on climate, forgettable on most other topics he chimed in on.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Is this national unity?”There are at least 1,000 halal shops and restaurants in the Chinese capital. Some have chosen to replace the Arabic halal signs with ones which use Chinese characters, while others visited by Reuters have simple taped over their Islamic symbols.Darren Byler, an anthropologist at the University of Washington who is an expert on Xinjiang, said China’s Communist Party saw Islamic culture and Arabic as foreign influences outside of its control.“It is also seen as connected to international forms of piety, or in the eyes of state authorities, religious extremism. They want Islam in China to operate primarily through Chinese language,” he said.Uighur Muslim woman tells Congressional-Executive Commission on China she asked Chinese to kill her whilst in detention campZha Xi, from China’s National Erthnic Affairs Commission, would only say the constitution protected the rights of all minority groups and insisted halal regulation was handled by Beijing’s local government.But the Beijing council’s committee on ethnicity and religious affairs also declined to comment, saying there was a national directive on halal restaurants.The expunging of Arabic and Islamic signs marks one of the softer parts of China’s attack on Islam.Human rights groups and the UN have decried the large camps set up in Xinjiang as equivalent to “wartime concentration camps”.Former detainees have spoken of Muslim Uighurs inside he camps being forced to denounce Islam, swear loyalty to the Communist Party and even eat pork or drink alcohol – both forbidden by their religion.The government maintains it is simply attempting to combat Islamic extremist terrorism in Xinjiang.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Books spill out from the pavement stalls onto the street, where browsers kneel to rifle through an eclectic offering.Gabriel Garcia Marquez sits alongside a book of American idioms.

Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing.

It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.“The idea of the book is that Saddam entered Kuwait without the knowledge of the generals. It was forbidden.”Mutanabbi’s Street’s troubles didn’t end with Hussein. In 2007, a car bomb ripped through the market, killing 30 people and injuring hundreds. It took years for it to recover.Today, the street is alive again, and the bestseller list is moving with the times.“The people who are buying are young people, honestly. They are currently looking for novels, or stories,” says Maher Muhammad, a bookshop owner on the street.“But this thing will not last. What do we say about that? It’s just like a pot will boil and collapse.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I see on it people I once admired behave in a way that erases nearly all respect.Intelligent iniduals make comments they would regretthey had been texts to friends, let alone messages to the whole world.People who once seemed judicious in their judgements behave — at best — like scolds, desperately attempting to ­correct the world for not ­holding precisely the same views as themselves.Yet Twitter has the ability to ­highlight at speed problems only ­noticeable at a slower RPM in the real world.One is the uncomfortable, ever-vanishing line between comment and journalism.While this blurring is not completely new, there was a fine example last week.As news of Boris Johnson’s successful Conservative Party election victory broke, Lewis Goodall — Sky’s political correspondent — tweeted a photo of a television autocue with the caption: “So great to share a set with Black Mirror today.”For those unfamiliar with it, Black Mirror is a Netflix series created by the formerjournalist Charlie Brooker featuring ious dystopian fantasy futures.There is not very much for Goodall or anyone  to gain from this observation.It is possible some people saw it and gave a snort of appreciation.Perhaps somebody somewhere actually laughed. But it is unlikely anyone is still roaring, days later, at the brilliance and perceptiveness of the observation.Like most things on social media, the short-term gain is not worth the cost. For a cost there is, paid in public trust evennot by the tweeter.If broadcasters still cared about the editorial independence of their employees, comments like this would not be made by their journalists.For they further reveal what most of the public has come to suspect — that broadcasters presenting themselves as non-partisan in fact hold very clear political views and that these usually veer in a particular direction.Most, for instance, tend not to be enthusiastic Leave voters who secretly admire Prime Minister Boris Johnson and occasionally let this truth slip. Of course, people have always harboured their suspicions.But not until journalists began to freely give away their thoughts on social media was there such a smorgasbord of evidence.For years, Gavin Esler was the apparently impartial presenter of many leading BBC political shows, including Newsnight, holding people to account whatever his own views.This was back when we viewers did not have access to a presenter’s opinions.Instead, we would have to guess from throwaway remarks or how one interview compared with another.After the Brexit vote, however, it became clear that Esler had strong views about British membership of the EU.Then, this April, he announced his membership and candidacy for the pro-Remain party Change UK.In a speech at its launch and in subsequent media appearances, he turned out to be as partial as it was possible to be.Indeed, some of his political interventions could legitimately be described as “foam-flecked”.Are the public to pretend Gavin Esler pre- was a dferent beast from the Gavin Esler of this year Or do we presume he always held certain views and only broke out when there was a chance to express them while standing — as it turned out, unsuccessfully — as a candidate for the European Parliament By following broadcasters on Twitter, particularly from the BBC and Sky, it is clear to see the barrier is eroding for everyone.When Goodall sent his Black Mirror tweet, the journalist Tim Montgomerie tweeted: “Throughout Sky News we have pundits posing as reporters. Neither Sky execs nor Ofcom seem to give a damn.”In response, Goodall’s Sky News colleague Kay Burley went for Montgomerie herself, tweeting: “You’re an absolute disgrace to our profession. Seriously.”It was, as Montgomerie went on to say, a pretty unprofessional response in itself.But he was right. There is something strange about this whole game.Partly it is so eroding to public trust because it all goes in one direction.On one single occasion in recent years has a television presenter let slip a view that did not fall into lockstep with the narrow orthodoxies of the broadcasting class.When ­Politics Live presenter Andrew Neil sent out one tweet last year mocking the increasingly conspiratorial Observer writer Carole Cadwalladr, he deleted the tweet and himself became a news story.There were swt calls for his sacking and the BBC felt compelled to publicly chastise Neil.Though widely considered the country’s leading ­political interviewer, Neil no longer has a regular slot on the BBC.The incident stands out partly because it is so unusual for a broadcaster not to go in one predictable direction, but also because it was clear that a price must only be paid when the opinions are the “wrong” ones.The breaking of the “fourth wall” — which meant impartial broadcasters refrained from veering into personal political expression — has had a damaging effect on broadcast journalism.Just observing what a broadcaster like Emily Maitlis chooses to retweet tells me more than I want to know about her own political views.These retweets go in the usual direction, and it bothers me not a jot where those views dfer from my own.The trouble is they begin to colour the rest of the work.When Rod Liddle appeared on Newsnight and was roundly harangued and insulted by Maitlis, I did not think: “What a tough interview.”Having seen what Maitlis had tweeted and retweeted in recent months, I simply saw the same views played out in the Newsnight studio.There was no mystery, no separation between impartial interviewer and opinionated tweeter.Will this have an impact  My guess is it already has.And when the broadcast media complains about disappearing trust in their profession, remember — they have only themselves to blame.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was clear he had never suffered the injuries he would have suffered had he really been subjected to the acts he claimed had been committed against him.He had never been absent from home or school at the time he claimed he had been abused.Moreover, there was no trace of the two children who Beech claimed had been killed by the supposed paedophile gang.Surely these are the first checks which should have been made before police started raiding the homes of suspects.If there is no sign that the murder “victims” had ever existed, that should have set a very loud alarm bell ringing in the ears of police investigators.Yet on they ploughed, driven by the perverse doctrine that anyone who alleges that they have been a victim of sex abuse must automatically be assumed to be telling the truth.That doctrine was a magnet for fantasists such as Nick, who gain a thrill from putting innocent people through the mill — and who stand to pocket a fortune in compensation.Why on Earth was Beech paid £, by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board before his allegations had been tested in court The top brass of that organisation need to hang their heads in shame.Many people are going to be asking: Just how much more taxpayers’ money has been merrily handed out to “victims” who have been telling fibs Sir Richard has demanded a criminal investigation into the Met decision to raid suspects’ homes without proper evidence.But even without that element of the story, it is a disgrace that no police officer has been investigated for misconduct.Instead, those in charge of the investigation have been rewarded. Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway was promoted to superintendent while under investigation for alleged misconduct in the case, and retired just before Beech’s trial.Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald — who infamously described “Nick’s” allegations as “credible and true” — also retired on a gold-plated pension before the Beech trial began.Ex-Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse, who oversaw Operation Midland, has been booted upstairs to a plum, £,-a-year job at the National Crime Agency.Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has been rewarded with a peerage. What an utter farce his elevation makes of the honours system.Sir Richard said the Met has “sought to protect itself from effective outside scrutiny” over Operation Midland, and claims that during an investigation he oversaw into the operation in , the Met failed to pass on all the relevant documentation.He added: “I remain unable to conclude that every officer acted with due diligence and in good faith.”But most contemptible of all, in a way, is the behaviour of Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson.Without Watson, it is unlikely that Beech’s allegations would have been taken so seriously.It was Watson who invited Beech to his Westminster office, who stoked the political heat and put the pressure on police to take Beech’s allegations far more seriously than they deserved.And what has been his reaction since Beech was found guilty last week  Not to apologise but to claim, preposterously, that he, too, was a victim of Beech’s. Rubbish, Mr Watson.You seized on “Nick’s” allegations because you could see the political dynamite of a case which involved a former Conservative Prime Minister, Edward Heath, and ex-Home Secretary, Leon Brittan.The main victims of Beech are, of course, the men he ly accused of forming a paedophile ring, but we should not forget another class of victims — those genuinely abused and who now might be shy of reporting the crimes against them for fear of being taken to be another Beech.Police officers, Watson and the chiefs of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board bear a heavy responsibility for what has happenedOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Worse still, just six months later he filed for orce, with royal sources suggesting that he had become increasingly uncomfortable with the rumours surrounding his stunning bride’s past le.Now the Sultan is questioning whether he is the father of Oksana’s two-month-old son.But just who is the -year-old stunning model who bewitched - and lost - a king Sun Online can reveal Oksana had a dficult childhood - and claims she was whipped by her father.Oksana and the Sultan at their lavish wedding in Moscow in June She was the eldest of three children in her strict Cossack family, and grew up in undesirable Taganrog, a resort on the Azov Sea.Oksana recently revealed her surgeon father Andrey Gorbatenko, , often beat her as a child.“I could feel a whip on my bottom, she recently recalled.My father and also my grandfather are very strict… Honestly, I was afraid of my father when I was a child. Now I understand that only thanks to him was I raised and educated in the best way.In fact there was little to suggest that the young Oksana would go on to captivate a King, describing her younger self as a rule-breaker with “a wonky haircut”.When I was at school, I was a kind of bandit, she recalled. I liked some skaters, bikes, BMX, guys who took part in competitions. I love riding a bike too. I was a good pupil.She added: “To be honest, I was never my schools beauty.It’s a sentiment echoed by her class teacher Tatiana Pirogova.It was a class with very beautul girls who were into the modelling business,” she explained.All of them were tall and had long legs. And Oksana didnt stand out. Compared to other girls she was very modest. She didnt go to any modelling agencies, she was only thinking about studies.Initially her path seemed academic: after leaving school Oksana, who attended a language crammer in Oxford, enrolled at the prestigious Plekhanov University of Economics in Moscow, graduating in .By then she was already working as a model – work which apparently led her to the attention of producers of a Russian reality TV show filmed in Mexico the same year.In echoes of Love Island, the lurid show featured eleven young Russians thrust together at a luxury villa.Among the participants was a woman called Ksenia-Nikol – who shot to fame after being seduced during her first day on set by womanising contestant Elisey Polischuk - and the pair had sex in the pool.There is now speculation that Oksana was actually Ksenia-Nikol - and a fellow contestant seemed to confirm it in an interview with a Russian newspaper.What her future husband knew about his bride’s colourful past remains unclear.While their meeting was initially shrouded in mystery, Oksana recently confirmed that she met the Sultan - who orced his first we in  - at a  jewellery event where she was working as a model.We met in spring  in Europe, she confirmed.  After the event, we went for dinner, where I met a man, and he introduced himself as the King of Malaysia. I took it as a joke and joked back that I was also the Queen of Moscow. We talked all evening and exchanged phone numbers.Footage obtained by Sun Online shows the Russian beauty swathed in diamonds and Colombian emeralds that night.King Muhammad was there on a private visit. Witnesses say that once the monarch had seen Oksana with her royal look, all the other beauties stopped existing for him.The couple would go on to have a whirlwind courtship before their glittering Moscow wedding a year later.Her father Andrey, meanwhile, has revealed how his daughter had telephoned to describe the fateful meeting.The same evening my daughter rang me, he recalled. She said: Dad, I met a man at the jewellery fair. He introduced himself as a king. Shall I continue to stay in touch with him ’’.Her father had told her to ignore his royal status and concentrate instead on what kind of person he is.The couple went on to marry in June  in a lavish ceremony in Barvikha, a ritzy Moscow suburb, home to many of Russias rich and powerful.Oksana converted to Islam, taking the name Rihana Oksana Petra.But it was not enough to reassure conservative Malaysians, who were upset by the brides past as an underwear model.Even so, the couple’s happiness seemed complete when, in May, Oksana gave birth to a son,Tengku Ismail Leon Petra Bin Tengku Muhammad V Faris Petra - known simply as Leon.After the birth, Oksana had expressed the hope on her Instagram account that he would be crowned the ‘crown prince of Kelantan and, Inshallah, the future king of Malaysia.’And in June she posted a romantic picture of the couple on a marble staircase clutching a rose, with a tribute to her good husband.She wrote: A good husband will always support and be nice with his we. Always is interested how does she feel and takes care of her,she is tired.Always % keeps his promises.But last month came the shock news that The Sultan had filed for orce, with a certicate registered on July  in Singapore indicating it came about through the utterance of the word talaq three times - the most severe and irreversible form of orce in Islam.In a further controversial move, the Sultan’s lawyer issued a statement alleging that “there is no objective evidence as yet as to the biological father of the child”.The allegation led Oksana to make a public offer to have a DNA test to prove her baby’s royal paternity.In another twist, the Russian beauty seems to believe her husband  is not behind the orce certicate and that they are still married.Just four days ago she posted a message on her Instagram page stating: When we first learned about the orce news, Leon and I were at our house in Russia. I did not receive any subpoena or court letter.Secondly, my husband is a good Muslim, he would not have done such things without my knowledge.She has also questioned whether the orce is valid, telling a Malaysian news outlet: This is an act of provocation.In this ongoing drama it is unlikely to be the last. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

with her daughter later calling  as she started to feel sick.But after the paramedic arrived, they declined to take her to AE immediately and instead advised her to take painkillers, the High Court heard.Mrs Austin, who had initially thought she had tweaked a tendon, later had to have her arm removed.She sued the South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust, claiming her limb would have been savedthe paramedic had taken her to hospital on the previous evening.And after ruling that the delay in getting her to hospital was a breach of the duty owed to the patient, a judge today awarded Mrs Austin the right to damages which could reach £,.Judge Geoffrey Tattersall QC told the High Court that Mrs Austin picked up the bug when she suffered a relatively minor non-penetrating trauma to her arm during the exercise class.The court heard how Mrs Austin began to suffer pain in her arm - with her GP diagnosing her with a torn tendon.Barrister Richard Baker said on the night of August  she collapsed at home in agony.Its often referred to as a flesh-eating disease, though the bacteria dont eat the flesh.Rather, they release toxins that damage the nearby tissue.The condition can start from a relatively minor injury, such as a small cut, but can progress and get worse very quickly.If its not recognised quickly, the condition can become le-threatening.Symptoms can develop quickly, and early signs include:After a few days, its likely youll notice:Necrotising fasciitis is a medical emergency that can spread very quickly. It is importantyou suspect you are suffering with it, you dial  immediately.She began to suffer with sickness due to the undetected spreading infection.Mrs Austin’s daughter, Julie Newman, called  and spoke on her mothers behalf to the “enhanced paramedic” who arrived.But in the end, the paramedic in charge did not take her into hospital that night, in the belief that her problem was abdominal.By the time she was finally admitted to Stoke Mandeville Hospital on the morning of August , it was too late to save her limb from the effects of a flesh-eating bacteria which had destroyed tissue in her arm.Mrs Austins lawyers argued that the paramedic was wrong not to take her to hospital and that that led to her losing her arm to amputation.Ruling on the case, Judge Tattersall said the paramedic had decided it was not necessary to take Mrs Austin, who had seen her GP earlier that day, to hospital.“She advised that Mrs Austin should continue taking paracetamol and rehydration fluids and that she or her family should contact her GPthe symptoms persisted, or call the ambulance backthey were concerned,” he added.The medic focused on Mrs Austin’s abdomen as the source of her symptoms, he said, and took no steps to examine her patient’s affected arm.“Given the history of pain, it was in my judgment not reasonable for the paramedic not to examine the arm,” the judge found.Mrs Austin, although still conscious and communicating, had lost control of her bladder and bowels and was therefore in a serious condition, the court heard.The judge added: “My finding that she had lost control of her bladder and bowels is sufficient to justy my conclusion that the paramedics were in breach of their duty of care owed to Mrs Austin by failing to arrange for her immediate transfer and admission to Stoke Mandeville.There were  hours in which she could have been diagnosed with necrotising fasciitis and received appropriate surgical treatment short of amputation, he added.Although she would have suffered damage to her arm in any event, she would have escaped the horror of amputation, he continued.She would have been left with a cosmetically unattractive arm which would have been very weak and very restricted at the elbow, but it would have had some useful,restricted, , he added.The case willto court at a later date for an assessment of the amount Mrs Austin will receive in damages,not agreed."},{"url":null,"title":"quinn beadle hang durham grooming","story":"Quinn Beadle, , took her own le and her father came across the scene, already filled with paramedics and police moments later while walking the dogs.The kind and funny Quinn, from Durham, had ordered her favourite takeaway dish of chicken korma before announcing she was just popping out last December.Moments later she took her own le.Tracey, the teens mum, told The : Quinn was our beautul  year old daughter, she was kind, funny, stubborn, quirky, crazy and amazing.

Anthony John Wixted, , breached a worldwide ban on revealing the killeraposs identity by posting the picture, as well as an alias purportedly used by Venables and the prison in which he was allegedly being held. Wixted, from south London, admitted contempt of court over the breach of a  injunction banning the publication of anything purporting to reveal the identities, appearance or whereabouts of Venables and Robert Thompson. Aged , Venables and Thompson murdered two-year-old James Bulger in February  after abducting him from a shopping centre in Liverpool and leading him to a railway track .miles away. Jamesapos mutilated body was found two days after he went missing.  They have been living anonymously with new identities since being released from a le sentence for the kidnap, torture and murder of James when they were aged . Sentencing Wixted at the High Court in London on Thursday, Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Mr Justice Jeremy Baker, said: Save in exceptional circumstances, a deliberate breach of this injunction should result in immediate custody. There is in our view nothing exceptional about this case. Wixted, appearing in court in an orange shirt and a red tie, showed no emotion as he was handcuffed and led away to the cells.The court heard that on February  , around the time of the th anniversary of the murder, Wixted posted the photo on his Twitter account, which had more than , followers, with the words SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE.Lord Justice Bean said two other Twitter users replied to Wixtedaposs post, warning him about the existence of the injunction and the fact that he had breached it.  But Wixted replied to one: Most people on Twitter think Iaposm doing a good job ... I donapost have to justy anything to anyone. Wixted also added a link to a local newspaper article about the conditions at the prison in which Venables was allegedly being held with the caption LOL. Lord Justice Bean said the initial tweet was not deleted for three months and was retweeted  times and liked at least  times. Sentencing Wixted, Lord Justice Bean said the High Court had repeatedly stated that breaches of the injunction preventing the identication of Venables or Thompson should result in immediate custodial sentences save in exceptional circumstances. That is so not only because breaches pose a substantial risk to Venables or Thompson, but also because they pose a substantial risk to innocent members of the public who might be mistaken for Venables, as occurred in .  Earlier, Bernard Richmond QC told the court in mitigation that Wixted was a rather sad and lonely inidual who has for many, many years been fighting his own demons. He said Wixted was interested in journalism and, in particular, in the subject of child abuse, and much of the work he has done has been perfectly legitimate. But Wixted had stupidly decided to post the picture at a time when many other people were getting worked up about the same thing, he added. Asking the court to suspend any custodial sentence, Mr Richmond said Wixted had not only taken the post down but also decided not to engage in any discussion about Mr Venables.

Lucy Jane Diep competes with hundreds of others when the bidding process starts every Thursday and ends in the same way. The -year-old tries to apply for a new house in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, every Thursday when the bidding process starts. Lucy revealed that she often doesnapost even get the opportunity to bid because there are so few homes big enough to house her, her partner, and her three children. Social housing in the borough is allocated through a scheme called Rochdale HomeChoice, run by housing association Rochdale Boroughwide Housing , Rochdale Council and other agencies. HomeChoice applicants are assessed according to their housing need, given a priority band and advised what size of home they are eligible for. They are then able to bid on up to three homes per week - with the person in the highest priority band chosen.  Lucy, a full-time mum, lives in a two-bedroom house in Deeplish with her partner and three children. She said she is only eligible for a four-bedroom house so there will be periods of up to six weeks in a row when she is unable to even bid. Lucy said: So I will bid on any house I am eligible for no matter the area but when I check I don’t even come in the top  and there are always hundreds of bidders trying to get the same house. In my opinion there’s not enough houses. It’s hard to saythe system is working but for me it isn’t. It is very frustrating. It’s hard as well - five people living in a two-bed house. More homes are needed, that’s all I can think that can help solve it - or [they need to] get private landlords on board with cheaper rents so that it’s not just council or housing association houses you can bid on. Lucy is not alone.  Within just one hour of the bidding cycle opening one week in June, there were already  bids across  properties in the borough. Towards the end of the cycle the following week, a total of , bids had been placed - an average of over  per property, with one house receiving over  alone. Just three of these properties were in Rochdale town centre - and they had an average of more than  bids each. Nicola Wood has lived in Rochdale for  years - first with her parents and then renting privately, until now. Along with her husband, Nicola originally wanted a two-bedroom house for her two children but was told because she was renting privately and not homeless, she would not be a priority. Nicola said: “Time went by, I had another child and again pushed the housing as three children in a two-bed house was really hard. Especially having to sleep in my living room on a blow-up bed heavily pregnant was taking its toll on me when I was working  hour shts in the bookies.” Nicola, who now has five children and still lives in the same two-bed house, said the bidding process has aposbecome my nightmareapos. She says she has been waiting for a house for  years.  And to make matters worse, her family face losing their current home in the next few years as the landlord plans on taking it back. Nicola said: Housing associations’ priorities are terrible to the point where I may as well be in a tent. I’m sure I will find one bigger than our home. It’s soul-shattering waking up to new houses added and  people have already bid so you have no chance of getting a viewing. Everyone deserves a home. I have a roof above my head but me and my children have never had a home. That’s sad for my kids and I know they’re going to have the same problem. Since becoming a mutual housing society in , RBH have administered the council’s allocation policy, as well as running the homeless service on their behalf. RBH said it recognised the current system aposcauses anxiety and frustrations for many peopleapos and acknowledged aposthere is not the right mix and quality of homes to meet current need and demandapos. An RBH spokesperson said: The council’s allocations policy covers homes owned by RBH and those owned by the other main housing associations with homes in the borough.

They love their caravan holidays and I just couldn’t tell them that they wouldn’t be going on one this year. £ is a lot of money to lose as a single mum. This has happened to at least five families through the same man, and none of us have received our money back.” Emma, who is set to get married later this month, paid her deposit last year after contacting Tony on Facebook, and had been paying her holiday off in instalments. It was only after completing her payments that Emma saw Belinda’s Facebook post and immediately contacted Tony and Butlins to confirm these claims. “I spoke to a woman over the phone at Butlins when things started to get fishy and she said: ‘I’m sorry to tell you this but the caravan has been repossessed’,” said Emma. “I asked her what I was meant to do now and how to get my money back and she told me to contact Tony, my bank and the police.” Tony is said to have made “every excuse in the book” when trying to explain why his caravan was repossessed.

Callie Rogers, , won £.million aged  but said: “I was too young.” There will not be many ­people who declare they are happier than ever after blowing a £.million lotto jackpot. But Callie has told how landing a fortune at  plunged her into a cycle of despair as she suffered physical and verbal abuse and was hounded by “fake friends” who only wanted a slice of her fortune. The -year-old insisted she is glad the cash has gone and called on ministers to raise the lottery gambling age limit to . She feels she was too young to handle the pressure and wants to stop other kids going through the same hell.  Single mum-of-three Callie is now earning just £, a year as a carer and living in a £-a-month rented home. And she insisted: “I am the happiest I have ever been.” But she revealed how after her win she lavished hundreds of thousands of pounds on family and friends, endured abuse by total strangers and was beaten up by two jealous women. And she said she is still owed £, by “fake pals” who took her debit card to buy Macbooks and gts for themselves as she partied at the height of her fame. Callie welcomed a government consultation on the lottery gambling age and joined the campaign to raise it. It comes amid mounting fears over the potential impact of gambling addiction on children’s mental health.    She said: “People still ask me about the lottery win all the time. “You are only a , with all that responsibility. At that age, you can get the best advice ever. “But you are not in a position to listen. I was too young. Overnight I went from carefree child to adult. All these years on, it still gets dragged up. “Even when I go for job interviews, I am thinking about it. I suffer from such bad anxiety when I am going to meet new people. It preys on my mind, what a new partner’s family will think of me, or even new friends. I still get abuse just because of who I am.” Callie recalled how when she was told she had scooped the jackpot on June , , making her Britain’s youngest lotto winner at  years and three months, she thought even then it was “too much” money. She was earning £. an hour as a Co-op shop assistant in her home town of ­Workington, Cumbria.  Callie, whose dad Jeff, , recently died of cancer, said: “I did not want that much money. I was in foster care and for the first time in a long time, I was really settled and really happy. When they told me it was a £million jackpot, I thought, ‘I don’t want that much.’ In the end it was shared out and I got £.million, but even then it was hard to take in. “At  you do not know what is ahead of you, because by God I did not expect any of that. I asked the Co-opI could have my old job back.” But Callie moved out and bought her first house at  with then boyfriend Nicky Lawson, the dad of her eldest ­children Kian, , and -year-old Debony. Callie, who also had a son, Blake, seven, and daughter Georgia, three, with fireman Paul Penny, splashed the cash on holidays, cars and presents.    She added: “I would give money to distant relatives and friends of friends. I loaned £, here, £, there. I would never get it back. “People asked for money for new cars and I would help out. I was a soft touch. Now I realise what they were like. I was exploited because of my age. I had a lot of fake relationships.” At age  things took a sinister twist after she and Nicky had a dficult time. Callie tried to kill herself and her children were taken from her. She spent £, on boob jobs to boost her self confidence. But Callie denies she spent £, on cocaine. She said: “Put simply, someone  was going to sell a story on me. “It was put to me that I might as well talk about it. So many people made money from selling fake stories. So I agreed to talk. I know that I was far from perfect. I did what ­teenagers do and I went out and had parties. “But I have never ever been a druggie or blown a load of money on cocaine.” Callie advises any young winners to keep their fortune secret. She said: “The publicity was the hardest part for me because of my b­ackground.

Cheshire Fire and Rescue Servicesaid firefighters, emergency services personnel and staff from Highways England were helping those affected, with a rest centre established at the local civic hall. Rescuers have been working through the night to help people in the worst flood-hit areas. It follows a day of flood chaos across the country with bridges destroyed and roads turned into impassable rivers. In Poynton, police urged people not to ignore road closed signs by driving or walking through water.Have you been affected by the floods  Email webnews@mirror   Poynton Fire Station said its crews had been to more than  incidents, including rescuing at least  people from flood water in the area over a four-hour stretch. Police in nearby Wilmslow also said its officers were dealing with flooding and had evacuated affected residents, with Oakenclough Childrenaposs Centre open as a rest centre. The Environment Agency put out multiple flood warnings and alerts covering central, north-west and north-east England on Wednesday.  On Thursday, Northern rail said flooding had disrupted all lines of the railway between Manchester Airport and Wilmslow. Yesterday, the Army was called in to help in North Yorkshire, where a bridge on Grinton Moor, which featured in the opening stage of the  Tour de France, was wrecked. Soldiers from  Yorks laid sandbags for residents in the village of Grinton, where .in of rain had fallen in just two hours. The Yorkshire Dales, the Midlands and Lancashire were among the worst affected areas, but flood warnings were out for Cheshire, Derbyshire, Notts, Co Durham and Scotland last night. In North Yorks, landlady Rowena Hutchinson, , said rain came in “like a waterfall”, at the Red Lion Inn in Langthwaite, Richmond, leaving her up to her chin in water.    She said: “The water just rushed in from the back. It rushed through, and slammed the front door shut and then it rose up to about ft. “I slipped and went under up to my chin, and then managed to grab hold of a bench and pull myself out, but the force of water and speed was just unbelievable.” She managed to get upstairs and called for help from a window. A fireman later carried her out on his back. The pub, in her family for  years, is unlikely to reopen until after Christmas.  Rowena said: “It’s completely smashed, doors off, and a wall has gone. The speed and force of the water was unbelievable.” Major routes were turned “into rivers” and left impassable in what police described as “shocking” travel conditions. It was the picturesque towns and villages of the Yorkshire Dales which were worst hit. Steve Clough, of Swaledale Mountain Rescue, said: “The roads were a raging torrent and there were sheds and household oil tanks floating down them.    “Some homes had a metre of water in them – it was horric.” His team spent more than eight hours searching properties, rescuing about  people. Firemen went to  flooded homes in the area. The fire station in Leyburn, North Yorks, even flooded while its crews answered emergencies. The Brymor Ice Cream parlour, near Masham, North Yorks, was caught in a freak hailstorm. A spokesman said: “Our parlour suffered damage to the roof, power failures and some visitors suffered minor injuries.” Gareth Walls, from nearby Ripon, tweeted that the hailstones had been “like pickled onions”.  The Ard Rock mountain biking festival, planned for Swaledale this weekend, has been cancelled after the rain left the site devastated. Organiser Alex Rafferty, , said: “The rain just came down off the hills in waterfalls, it blew the riverbanks and has damaged a huge amount of infrastructure, local houses and local businesses.” The storms, which brought , lightning strikes in a day, caused chaos, with parts of a railway line between Kirkby Stephen and Garsdale in Cumbria washed away.

Alana Cutland unbuckled her seatbelt and opened a door shortly after take-off, and then jumped out of the Cessna light aircraft despite the pilot and a second passengeraposs desperate efforts to stop her. The -year-old, who had been researching crabs as part of her natural science degree, plunged up to ,ft, and her body has not been found despite searches by police and villagers in an area populated by fossas, carnivorous cat-like animals. Alana had been picked up from a remote lodge where she was taking part in an internship, and was on her way back to the UK after her parents became concerned about her, according to reports.Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror   Before the student plunged to her death, the pilot and British tourist Ruth Johnson spent about five minutes struggling to hold on to her and prevent her from jumping out of the door, say police. She jumped out after the pilot and Ms Johnson became exhausted and lost their grip.Alana is understood to have fought off Ms Johnson before plunging into the savanna below, the Sun reported.The pilot grabbed onto Alanaaposs leg and manoeuvred the plane from side to side in a desperate bid to prevent her from flinging herself from the tiny propeller aircraft.  They were the only three people on board. The tragic incident happened  minutes after the plane took off from the remote Analalava region in northern Madagascar on July . Police have released a photo of a recreation of what they claim were her final moments inside the plane. It depicts a pilot and passenger grasping hold of a second passengeraposs leg as the person hangs out of the planeaposs open door.    It was reported Ms Cutland, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, suffered paranoia attacks while on the self-funded but failed research trip to the Indian Ocean island, off the east coast of Africa. Search teams and villagers have been looking for Alanaaposs body, and it is feared it may never be found. Local police chief Sinola Nomenjahary said the Brit may have landed in an area populated by wild fossas. Fossas are the largest carnivorous mammal on the island.  The slender, muscular animals grow to six feet indue to their long tails. Mr Nomenjahary told the Sun: “The Cessna C aircraft was taking off from Anjajavy with three people aboard, including Ms Johnson, Alana and the pilot. “After  minutes of flight, Alana undid her seatbelt and unlocked the right door of the plane and tried to get out. “Ms Johnson fought for five minutes trying to hold her, but when she was exhausted and out of breath she let go.  Mr Nomenjahary added that officers read through Alanaaposs documents and she may have been suffering from stress or mental health issues related to her studies. He added that police were working under the assumption that it was an intentional fall and said that they are working with British authorities to establish the exact circumstances surrounding her death.Alana was travelling home to the UK after recent conversations with her parents raised concerns, Midi Madagasikara reported.The fellow Brit passenger - a -year-old woman - had agreed to accompany her, and they were on their way to Ivato International Airport, the report added.  Police said Alana was in regular contact with her parents and was making her way home via the islandaposs main airport. Alanaaposs family have paid tribute to the talented second-year Natural Science student, who was in Madagascar on an internship. In a statement released by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, they said: “Our daughter Alana was a bright, independent young woman, who was loved and admired by all those that knew her. “She was always so kind and supportive to her family and friends, which resulted in her having a very special connection with a wide network of people from all walks of her le, who we know will miss her dearly.  “Alana grasped every opportunity that was offered to her with enthusiasm and a sense of adventure, always seeking to extend her knowledge and experience in the best ways possible. “She was particularly excited to be embarking on the next stage of her education, on an internship in Madagascar complimenting her studies in Natural Sciences. “Alana was also a talented dancer and embraced the more creative side of her talents with joy and commitment. “Her thirst for discovering more of the world always ensured she made the most of every second of her action-packed young le.  “We are heartbroken at the loss of our wonderful, beautul daughter, who lit up every room she walked in to, and made people smile just by being there. Alana was involved in the yoga and mindfulness society at the college, according to its website. She was also the vice-president of the dance society Cutazz.Devastated friends paid tribute to her on Facebook , with one writing: I can’t even process that this has happened. Absolutely devastating.

Looking back on last week, the boys put in a good performance.“The away goal’s a cushion for us as well, but we can’t go into the mindset of concentrating on having that. We need to go out and give another strong performance to win the game.“We’re back home, in front of the crowd again, so we want to play with the same tempo and momentum we did against the Finnish team– we got at them, created plenty of chances and we want to get on the front foot quite quickly in the game.“Hopefully we score a couple of goals.”McGinn wasn’t surprised Chikhura were able to compete with Aberdeen.He expects them to come to Pittodrie to sit in, hitting the Dons on the break. But he thinks the Red Army can help see McInnes’ men through to a third round tie against Croatians Rijeka.McGinn said: “You can tell they’ve got a few tactically very good footballers.“Given time on the ball they can punish you.“You’re going to these countries, you maybe don’t know too much about them, but you can guarantee there are good players out there.“From playing on the international stage, I’ve been to all of these countries before and they’re always technically good on the ball.“Last week they caused us problems when we lost the ball. Possession was turned over and they were really good on the counter-attack.“They’ll come here with the same mindset to weather the storm a little bit.“Hopefully the fans can come out in their numbers and create a hostile atmosphere for us.”A near sell-out Pittodrie will be totally dferent to the “strange” situation the Dons faced in Tbilisi, with less than , Chikhura and Reds fans in the , capacity arena.Taylor’s injury after  minutes – diagnosed as a torn hamstring – upset Aberdeen’s attacking rhythm, as Jon Gallagher and then Ryan Hedges were forced to fill in at full-back to allow Andy Considine to fill in at centre-half.Left-back Greg Leigh’stonight will ensure all of the Dons’ attacking talents are free to hurt Chikhura, according to McGinn.He said: “It knocked us a wee bit. We started really well in the game, were getting on the front foot and creating chances.“When Ash went down it was a bit of a blow. We’ve got strength and depth, but when Mikey Devlin gets injured and then Ash, it’s not ideal in the centre-back position.“Andy Considine’s come in. He’s played centre-half on numerous occasions and fitted in comfortably.“We’ve got Greg Leigh back tomorrow night, which will give us back the balance we’re used to and allow our attacking players to get forward and create chances.“We’ve work hard behind the scenes this week on dferent things we’ll try and do in the game.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44252642-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44252642-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44252642-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44252642-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"victory over aberdeen would be treated as major news in georgia","story":"The FC Chikhura Sachkhere manager, Samson Pruidze, says dumping Aberdeen would be the club’s biggest ever scalp in Europe.The Georgians face the Dons at Pittodrie tonight in the Europa League second qualying round.The first leg was drawn - in Tbilisi last week.FC Chikhura Sachkhere knocked out Turkish side Bursaspor in  and Israel’s Beitar Jerusalem last season.Pruidze said overcoming the Reds to set up a tie with HNK Rijeka in the next round would be major news in Georgia.He said: “In the last seven years when promoted to the top ision we have participated in European competition.“We have beaten Bursaspor and beat Beitar Jerusalem last year.“If we can beat Aberdeen it would be a big hit for us. It would be a big, big news for a small team like us,” he said.“When we drew Aberdeen the fans in Georgia knew about the club as it is a big team in Europe.”FC Chikhura Sachkhere made the six-hour, ,- mile journey to Aberdeen on Monday.They had a training session in the Granite City on Tuesday before a session on the Pittodrie pitch last night.Pruidze said: “We are happy to be here in Scotland as you have a big history of football.“Aberdeen is also a famous city for football.“We know we play against a very strong team in their home stadium.“But we have to score the goal. The goal is to score the goal,” he said.“Our team is very good with the ball.“Aberdeen are athletic, move fast, strong and are very dangerous at corner kicks.“We have our plusses too when we play the low ball.”For the first leg in Tbilisi a crowd of only , turned up at the , capacity national stadium.That attendance was only boosted by Chikhura Sachkhere making the match free entry to fans of both teams.A crowd of around , is anticipated at Pittodrie tonight.Pruidze said: “Psychologically we know the spectators come and press their local team because they want to see Aberdeen attacking the other team.“That is normal because they love football here.“The advantage is that Aberdeen have travelled to Finland and then Georgia so have been on the road a long time. So that is a psychological advantage for us.”Meanwhile Giorgi Koripadze, the scorer of the penalty in Tbilisi, believes flying to Scotland four days before kick-off was the right call.Koripadze said: “The decision was the right one from the management because it was time enough to adjust to the climate and environment as it was a long, long way to come here.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 7 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is disappointing that Michael Matheson was unable to attend his second A task force meeting in a row.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes. MacKenzie found Campbell Watt who let go a  yard strike which gave the Kyles keeper no chance.Inveraray sealed both points when Campbell Watt continued his good scoring run with his second goal of the game with  minutes remaining."},{"url":null,"title":"ardrishaig community trust maintains partnership with lochgilphead soccer centre","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMembers of the board of Ardrishaig Community Trust turned out on Saturday July  morning to watch an exhibition game from some of the boys and girls of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre and took the time to formally renew their strategic partnership.Chair of the Trust Hamish Nicol said: #We are delighted to be associated with Lochgilphead Soccer Centre who share our values about a community approach to development.

Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"districts","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPreserving historic KilbrideA GoFundMe donation page is making the rounds after community group Friends of Kilbride made a plea for funds to preserve historic Kilbride.Kilbride, located three miles south of Oban, includes the ruins of a th-century church, Clan MacDougall’s memorial aisle and an extensive graveyard dating back many centuries.

Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing.

A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall. A great result for the team with no damage or mechanical issues to report.Class  had four teams registered in the STRC this year at Mach  but only one managed to finish.

concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe

It would be hard not to notice the single imposing figure of the dersquoil amongst the floral sea of youngsters.John Cockburn, clad in a black cloak and hood, carried the fiery red head of the dersquoil mounted on the top of a stout pole draped in red cloth. Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre.

UNICEF Rights Respecting School gold award, which means that it had proved that it incorporates the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child into the school through both teaching and actions.It now aims to take this further and bring this ethos into the surrounding community.The children were given the chance of addressing the meeting, which included ward councillors Fiona

to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

And would you recommend it to your friends back home  The answer to this one, however, was an emphatic ldquonon.Why  The trains, of course. Rickety, overcrowded, overbooked carriages, lack of luggage space, uncomfortable seats, catering that comprised of crisps and instant coffee, inadequate windows, overgrown trees making visibility dficult, service cancellations their list of complaints was extensive. The rolling stock, they said incredulously, was little better than that used on the local network in Glasgow, despite the journey from Mallaig to Glasgow taking five and a half hours.My heart sank. Irsquod tried to warn them that the trains would not be up to European standards, but they were aghast at the reality. ldquoWhat a terrible waste of incredible landscape, they kept saying. I was ashamed but couldnrsquot argue with a word of what they said. Irsquove taken the West Highland Line three times in the last five years and had passenger experiences that range from not as bad as Irsquod feared, to bloody awful. The staff who work on the trains are pleasant and stoic, but the trains themselves are an embarrassing disgrace.Greatest railway journey on earth  Hardly. That the landscape is breath-taking and spectacular isnrsquot in question. Glimpsing white sandy beaches and shimmering sea through the mountains on the approach to Mallaig is one of lersquos great experiences. But when yoursquore assured a more comfortable ride with better visibility and catering on the local rail network in Munich, something is fundamentally amiss.Read more: Row over -day closure of West Highland LineTo think that Scotland is letting its visitors down in this way, not to mention the communities that would see such economic benefit from a well-served West Highland Line, is frustrating and depressing in equal measure, especially since rail tourism, with its cleaner environmental footprint, is surely the future.Not that the state of trains is putting tourists off. Indeed, the global trumpeting of Scotland means passenger numbers are rising on all branches of the line Glenfinnan station saw a  per cent increase last year. Tourism has never been more valuable to the Scottish economy, bringing in upwards of poundbn a year, with visitors from Europe and the US flocking here off the back of a cheap pound and TV shows such as Outlander.But the more visitors that come, the more ill-equipped ScotRail will be to give them a pleasant journey on the West Highland Line. Improvements have been promised many times over the years but come to nothing. A few extra services have been put on in summer, and some new carriages with better luggage space are apparently in the offing. But better trains with improved seating and windows, and locally-sourced catering, are still nowhere to be seen, despite being mooted after Abellio was given the rail franchise in October .To be fair, ScotRail can only work within the financial confines of its contract. And a painfully slow-moving Transport Scotland review of the line is charged only with exploring improvements within current levels of investment. Itrsquos also worth pointing out that the line is old and remote, which limits the type of trains that could be run, and the Highlands has long been at the back of the queue when it comes to rail upgrades.Whatrsquos needed now, then, is a far more ambitious improvement plan for the West Highland Line, one that includes infrastructure boosts for the communities along the way as well as fully-staffed, modern trains with viewing carriages, comfortable seating and a high-quality catering offering serving tasty local produce. In other words, the sort of trains that are the norm on scenic journeys in Germany, Switzerland and France. How did they get such trains  By making public transport and tourism a political priority.If the political will existed in Scotland to raise the funds and bring stakeholders together, the West Coast Line could have the best trains in Europe. Are you listening, SNP Government  You canrsquot just blame ScotRail and Westminster-all need to work together forchange.Boris Johnson makes his first Prime Ministerial visit to Scotland today, fresh from backing a high-speed rail link between Leeds and Manchester. He could do worse than trying to win over his many detractors here by promising the Scottish Government the sort of funding that could transform our rail infrastructure. And first in the queue for investment should be the West Highland Line. Without it, this jewel in the crown of Scottish tourism can never be a truly great railway journey."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Judge society by how happy we are  not how wealthy","story":"The merest glimpse of the lives of moguls, oligarchs and millionaires tells you that. Are the faces staring out from the pages of glossy magazines shining with wellbeing  They might be tanned, toned, and expensively exfoliated, butany of these iniduals has a heart full of joy, it is unlikely to be as a result of their lestyle.In a recent talk, Nicola Sturgeon made an appeal to commonsense, stating what, deep down, most of us already know. She claims that when calibrating a countryrsquos standing and success, gross domestic product is not the most accurate measure. Not least among the misleading factors when using GDP as a guide is that its figures ignore unpaid carersrsquo work, yet put a value on illegal drug consumption. Just as worryingly, says Ms Sturgeon, ldquoIt values activity in the short term that boosts the economy eventhat activity is hugely damaging to the sustainability of our planet in the longer term.The First Ministerrsquos laudable aspiration is that ldquothe objective of economic policy should be collective wellbeing ndash how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy a population is. Hoping to establish a fairer and truer scale of assessment, she is collaborating with the prime ministers of New Zealand and Iceland ndash women all, in charge of countries geographically on the fringes, who are prepared to challenge convention.Cynics might, of course, say that Ms Sturgeon is simply laying the groundwork for another independence bid, in which those predicting dire financial consequences will be brushed off as old-fashioned and out of touch by placing too much emphasis on our economic prowess. Yet with Brexit, not just economists but rabid Leavers acknowledge that orce from the EU will cause financial shockwaves. Clearly, this is a risk they think worth running. By the same token, idealists north of the Border, who want us to exit from the UK, often say that the possibility of diminished economic performance after independence would not in itself be a deal breaker. There are bigger issues at stake.That argument is for another day. At this point, were Scotland to become a pioneer in putting a fairer society ahead of a more affluent one, this would represent nothing less than a second enlightenment. The inequalities in health and housing, education and attainment that are nakedly apparent all around us, are shaming for one of the wealthiest countries in the world. No matter how much those at the top make, or how vibrant our financial markets, poverty and desperate hardship for too many people persists. Itrsquos tempting to think that those who see GDP and similar indices as telling the whole story have also embraced the biblical creed that the poor will always be with us ndash in other words, there is nothing we can do about their plight.While the SNP has not been far-sighted or proactive enough to combat the recent shocking rise in drug-related deaths, many of them linked to deprivation and hopelessness, nevertheless Ms Sturgeon and the like-minded leaders with whom she is allied, have a strong social conscience. If the message that money is only part of the equation takes hold, it could potentially prove a turning point for the way all rich societies see, and regulate, themselves.Naturally therersquos a danger when writing disparagingly about high-income earners of appearing either green-eyed or preachy. Despite spending a childhood in the pews, hearing how the widowrsquos mite was as valuable as the millionairersquos cheque, and that those who are hard up today will be blessed with eternal treasures in the hereafter, I nevertheless know that no pair of rose-tinted spectacles can make a terrying bill, an unattainable holiday or too-expensive winter coat, one bit easier to bear. As Mae West put it bluntly: ldquoIrsquove been rich and Irsquove been poor, and rich is better.When it comes to wellbeing, you donrsquot need a carbon monoxide monitor to recognise that the air in Stornoway or St Abbs is far better for us than that in the throbbing financial hearts of Edinburgh or Glasgow, or for that matter Tokyo and New York. Wellbeing consists of something way beyond liquidity, location, or assets. Those in their gated communities, who store their Cartier watches in a vault, have cut themselves off from the rest of society. Is that really enviable  This is not to say they might not be really decent, kind-hearted people who give generously to good causes. Perhaps some of them are. But no matter how open-handed they appear to be, money creates a spiralling gulf between the haves and the have-nots, and sometimes cause rts much closer to home, as family lawyers will attest.Far from solving the problem by capitalistsrsquo pet theory of ldquotrickle-down, too much capital at the top of society actually entrenches inequality. Thus, the endless pursuit of higher incomes, pricier properties, competitive conspicuous consumption, whether at a personal or national level, is intrinsically unhealthy. Once you believe that the GDP graph should show an inexorable year-on-year increase, you become blinkered. This is as true, I suspect, for those running the country as for the inidual.Hunger for amassing hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the power that comes with it, is a recipe for potential disaster. It is psychologically and spiritually corrosive. Slowing the Gradgrind pursuit of ever-greater productivity, focusing on more nourishing and longer-lasting priorities, is a way of calling time on the fallacy that the bottom line is all that matters, and that cash is king. It is a way of taking an ethical stance, and saying enough is enough. How to calculate what constitutes enough, of course ndash be it income, savings, love, leisure, charity, you name it ndash is even harder than measuring happiness.Read more: Scotlands history has lain in the British shadow for too long"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10212492.jpg?type=article-full","title":"dont-miss-fantastic-hidden-gems-throughout-angus-fife","story":"BalbinnyLooking for somewhere luxurious to stay in the Angus countryside  - then look no further than the stunning Balbinny.Situated in rolling farmland between the market towns of Forfar and Brechin, Balbinny benefits from -degree views across the River South Esk towards the Angus Glens, and onto the Cairngorms.A development of luxury self-catering accommodation all with master bedrooms featuring super king sized beds, flat screen televisions and bi-folding glass doors, treat yourself to luxury in the heart of the countryside.Complemented by an award winning swimming pool, spa and fitness suite - make the most of your stay by indulging in one of their therapeutic treatments.Tempted  ndash Grab pound off  nights or more between    -    and quote lsquoHeraldrsquo.Tel Email info@balbinnywww.balbinnywww.balbinny news-and-offerswww.facebook balbinnyInstagram balbinny-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Burntisland Golf ClubDating back to , the original Burntisland Golf Club is officially recognised as the tenth oldest golf club in the world.

I depend on him and I trust him.But her assistant is not a home carer or any kind of human support. Kaspa, who  year-old Glenys holds responsible for keeping Ken living in their own home, in Arbroath, is a black labrador. More importantly, he is a dementia dog.Nine years ago Ken Will, who is  was diagnosed with vascular dementia, and le quickly became desperate for Glenys. ldquoKen just wouldnrsquot accept it. He shut himself away and le was terrible, she says.She worked as a lollipop lady, but it increasingly became a struggle. ldquoI didnrsquot want to get up in the morning and in the evening I didnrsquot want to come home, she says. ldquoAnother three or four months and Irsquod have given up.The couple have been married for  years, but it looked as though Ken might have to go into some kind of residential care.ldquoThen we got word of people training dogs to work for people with dementia. Ken and I were lucky enough to be chosen.ldquoWersquove had Kaspa for six years now and le is great. When Ken gets emotional, Kaspa goes and puts his head on his lap. When he gets angry, Kaspa is there with a toy.\"Ken suffers from mini-strokes, and when he does Kaspa makes sure Glenys knows something is wrong. He fetches the post and he brings Kens medicine pouch when it is time to take pills.\" Hersquos Kenrsquos right hand man,\" Glenys adds.The Dementia Dogs scheme was a world first when it was pioneered in Scotland, as a partnership between two charities, Alzheimer Scotland and Dogs for Good, based in Banbury, Oxfordshire. It was initially the brainchild of a group of product design students from Glasgow School of Art.Since Kaspa became on of the first two dogs selected, it has supported  families across Scotland with highly trained assistance dogs to help people living with dementia.The dogs are trained in a iety of specialist tasks, from reminding someone to take their medication, to reducing anxiety and helping build confidence.When someone with dementia is out and about in the community, the dogs act as an icebreaker, helping counter the isolation often experienced by iniduals affected by the condition, and by their carers.The scheme doesnt just benefit dementia sufferers and their families. It was set up in partnership with the open prison Castle Huntly, which houses low risk prisoners nearing release. The prison provides a training room and outdoor space where dogs can be exercised and taught the specialist skills they need to help someone with dementia. Prisoners can sign up to participate and end up with qualications which can help them find jobs when they are released and ultimately mean they are much less likely to reoffend.Now the unique scheme is under threat, with funding coming to an end on August st and a campaign has been launched to raise over pound, to allow it to continue and expand. Although the two charities have pledged to find the funds to make sure families already supplied with dogs continue to be supported, no further families will ge able to benefit.Henry Simmons, Chief Executive of Alzheimer Scotland, said: ldquoWith over , people living with dementia in Scotland, almost every family now knows someone living with the illness. As the scale of dementia rises, we need new and innovative approaches to support people to live in their own homes and communities for longer.ldquoThe Dementia Dog project is a fantastic example of collaborative and pioneering working to develop dferent types of support for people living with dementia and we have been thrilled with its success over the past few years.\"The charities have launched an In the Picture campaign to help raise funds and make sure the option of a dementia dog is still part of the picture for families that could benefit from their support. \"I urge everyone to support to this incredibly important initiative to help make sure that no one faces dementia alone,\" Mr Simmons added."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-revenge-menu","story":"AS performers arrive in Edinburgh for the Fringe, comedian Lucy Porter has a look around town and remarks: \"I see that the Edinburgh restaurant Ive had a grudge against for  yearshas now closed.

Witnesses say they saw a number of gold miners ndash who want to expand their operation into new sections of the Amazon rainforest ndash enter the protected reserve of the Wajapi community and stab their leader to death.This is not an isolated incident, but the latest in a pattern of violence and intimidation. Intimidation that is intensying as a result of Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, and his policy of opening up the Amazon, the lungs of the planet, to further exploitation. The ancestral homes of the indigenous people are to be cleared.:Boris Johnson to chair first Brexit strategy meeting as no deal plans get poundbn boostWill today be the day we reach  degrees  That was the question being asked on news and TV outlets in the UK last week, just as mining assassins had struck down an indigenous leader in the ever more desperate and rapacious pursuit of profit.It is not a great leap to join these two dots. As the UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet said, the mounting violence against indigenous communities is clearing the way for ldquofurther destruction of the rainforest, with all the scientically-established ramications that has for the exacerbation of climate change.As Emryarsquos bloodied body was dumped in a river, a message was being sent. Move off these lands, or die. And with the death of the flourishing of these forests, the climate emergency ratchets up.Bolsonaro is keen to steam roller new tracts of the Amazon. As the director of the Amazon Watch Program, Christian Poirer has said, ldquohis regimersquos reckless policies and its wanton neglect of threatened forest communities is directly linked to rising violent criminality. When he is accused of pursuing mass deforestation, and of covering up for the violence against the peoples living in the Amazon, he simply says it is a lie.But he also wants to disarm criticism ndash in a dictatorial fashion. Since coming to power, he has dismantled government departments who focus on climate change. He has promoted climate change deniers to the highest offices.As soon as he came to power, he signed an executive order that handed the regulation of protected Amazonian lands to the Agricultural Ministry, which is dominated by agri-business interests.Bolsonaro has also displayed a long track record of anti-indigenous sentiment, once commenting: ldquoItrsquos a shame that the Brazilian cavalry wasnrsquot as efficient as the Americans, who exterminated their Indians.The disaster being visited upon Brazilrsquos , indigenous people is a disaster for the world. This is one consequence of the election of Bolsonaro.Last year, I went to Rio and Sao Paulo during the election to speak to activists and to report back to meetings in Scotland on the situation there. I met with campaigners and watched the results come in with hundreds of Fernando Haddad supporters, the candidate up against Bolsonaro. People held on to one another as it became clear, as expected, that Bolsonaro was going to win.:Boris Johnson accused of bias toward DUP on Northern Ireland visitThe very next day, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Sao Paulo and cities across Brazil. In an act of courageous defiance, they made clear they would resist the new regime.I spoke to activists about their plans. ldquoThe initial task is to survive, so we are organising solidarity networks, said one. This response was unsurprising. Attacks against LGBT people were a result of the huge propaganda effort waged by the Bolsonaro campaign.Marrielle Franco, a left-wing councillor in Rio, was shot dead months before. Her face now adorns walls across the city as a reminder of the violence of the forces of reaction in Brazil, as well as resistance unbowed in the face of aggression.I noted two days after the election: ldquoGunmen have attacked an indigenous Bororo village in Mato Grosso do Sul. The attackers destroyed the whole village. This is to clear the way for mining and logging. Clearances for the corporations to move in.Thus, the response from the boardrooms and the ideologues of global capitalism to the election of Bolsonaro was quite dferent from that of the rainforest defenders. The Wall Street Journal backed him to the hilt. He was the choice of the international markets. And more recently, the EU struck a Mercosur trade deal that is catastrophic for the environment. The deal negotiated by the European Commission, has been lauded as historic by Bolsonaro.The deal sees a trade in ldquocows for cars, whereby the EU gains access to markets for cars and other products and services with eliminated export taxes, infor Mercosur countries gaining access to markets for beef, sugar and other goods.Cattle farming is the single biggest contributor to the deforestation of the rain forest. Some  per cent of deforested areas in the Amazon are a result of commercial animal pastures. The deal incentivises the destruction, and it legitimises and entrenches Bolsonarorsquos approach.But that is nothing that wordsmith advocates of corporate globalisation cannot make sound progressive. As the Commissioner for Trade Cecelia Malmstrom put it, the agreement ldquobrings Europe and South America closer together in a spirit of cooperation.This is the internationalism of the neoliberal oligarchy. It is a faux internationalism that exists to perpetuate the elevation of corporate interests over the needs of people and planet.Emrya Wajapi is his name. Found murdered in a river, he and hundreds of thousands like him, are the last line of defence in the Amazon. Ranged against them ndash the violence of men desperate for gold and treasure. A regime that sees them as a pest to be eradicated. And a world system that elevates short-term profit above all .But the rivers are rising. And as the temperatures rise with them, it is time to turn up the heat on capitalism itself. Then we might rediscover the kind of internationalist spirit neededwe are to prevent our own extinction."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-grateful-leader-vision","story":"Her belief that the happiness and health of a population must be a major consideration when deciding government policy and practice flies in the face of the ideology of traditional Conservative administrations at Westminster. In this century David Cameron and Theresa May have fronted UK governments that have, unashamedly, put the interests of their party first and protected those with vested interests at the expense of wealth distribution and fairness. With Boris Johnson at the helm there are signs that the doctrine of conscience-free libertarianism will be further emboldened following a No Deal Brexit which will cripple the country and the vast majority of its people but buttress the wealthy both economically and politically.Dominic Cummings, senior adviser to Mr Johnson, very recently said that, in the view of the public, Tories do not care about poor people or the NHS. Whilst this statement could well be another part of his grand election strategy to stimulate debate, it is nonetheless true that societal isions have been accentuated under the Conservatives.Ms Sturgeon has introduced a Benthamite dimension to the national discourse at a time when clarity is most required regarding the nature of our values and what sort of country we wish to live in. She will, almost certainly, come in for criticism from political opponents for hypocrisy or idealism or both.A genuinely Utilitarian society may be a Nirvana in many ways, but it is greatly encouraging that we have a First Minister who possesses the ability to convey her vision, display her humanity and provide sound leadership at this juncture of unprecedented national crisis.The well-being and happiness of Scotland may well rest on her guidance in the weeks and months to come.Owen Kelly, Stirling.THE letter from James Martinis one of the best examples I have encountered of the use of the word hyperbole. We have ldquocringeworthy, whinging, victim persona, suffer, hate-filled, nationalist faces, screaming, foul mouthed, abuse, misappropriated Saltire, intolerant, ignorance, wanton display of boorishness, nationalist, nasty creed. My goodness, what side of bed did Mr Martin arise from that day The cause of this unmerited fury is the performance of Ian Blackford at Westminster and the crowd outside Bute House for the visit of Boris Johnson. I would commend to Mr Martin several viewings on the BBC Parliament channel of Scottish Questions at Westminster, where he will see behaviour from the non-SNP benches to which most of the above words could be applied, so in addition to hyperbole I see hypocrisy.The visit to Bute House by the PM has been well reported and televised by the media and is still available. After several viewings myself, I see an orderly crowd protesting with the booing being louder than the cheering and all in very close proximity to the PM and FM. What were the police thinking about in letting ldquohate-filled nationalists from both sides so close I take particular issue on Mr Martinrsquos comment on the waving of the ldquomisappropriated Saltire. The Saltire cannot be misappropriated by anyone, it is the flag of Scotland and may be used by those who wish to use it. That the SNP and independence supporters use it is perfectly natural. The fact that Scottish Unionists and especially the ldquoProud Scot iety choose not to, is their decision. We hear about Scottish Unionists rooting for Scotland too and so they should, but the Unionist peg is so shoogly they cannot bring themselves to wave the flag of their home country in ldquoour precious Union ndash shame on them.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.I WOULD point out to James Martin that the demonstration in Edinburgh was a peaceful one which left Boris Johnson in no doubt of the strength of feeling regarding Scotlands desire to remain within the EU, and the ultimate horror of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Martin reminds us that the new Prime Minister wasnt \"duly elected other than by a coterie of like-minded iniduals\" but that \"in the UK system the party given the majority chooses who will be PM, not the electorate\". Indeed, but Scotland hasnt chosen a Conservative government since the s, and as Scotland has but  MPs, Wales , Northern Ireland  and England , it is clear that under the UK system everyone gets the governments England elects, and Scotland is facing the unpalatable prospect of leaving the EU because England voted to leave. An affront to democracy which deserves to be protested against.Ruth Marr, Stirling.THE SNP and their apologists tell us on an almost-daily basis that Scotland did not vote for a Conservative government. Figures for the  Holyrood elections and  general elections show that SNP votes were . per cent and . per cent respectively indicating that the majority of Scots voters didnrsquot vote for an SNP Government. They complain that Scots didnrsquot vote for Boris Johnson, conveniently forgetting that Nicola Sturgeon was not voted in by the Scottish voters but simply took over from Alex Salmond when he stepped down after losing the  Independence referendum. The same people tell us that Scotland is being dragged out of the EU against its will. The EU referendum was a UK-wide vote with the result being binding on all parts of the UK. The SNP doesnrsquot accept this.In the  independence referendum  out of  Scottish council areas voted no to independence, so by applying SNP logic it would be reasonable for those council areas voting no in any future referendum to be allowed to remain within the UK. Then again the SNP does not do logic: but it does hypocrisy and cant extremely well.Donald Lewis, Gford, East Lothian.I WONDERit has occurred to Nicola Sturgeon and her party that the reason why they no longer have a majority in the Scottish Parliament, and lost so many seats at Westminster is because the Scottish electorate do not agree with their policies, especially that of seeking to break up the UK.Most people are now weary of reading in the newspapers, and hearing on radio and television of the latest rants and moans from Nicola Sturgeon et al.It would not surprise meBoris Johnson found his recent visit to the RN nuclear submarine base at Faslane less grim than that to Bute House.Robert I G Scott, Fe."},{"url":null,"title":"m-middle-class-working-class-roots","story":"The first came from Stacey Dooley, Glitterball winner and documentary maker, the Luton council house girl with no qualications who used to shoplt on Saturdays.

So, the challenge for us all is how will we meet these targets Renewables can supply up to % of Scotlandrsquos electricity, but that is just a fraction of our total energy usage.In June , the Royal Society of Edinburgh , Scotlandrsquos National Academy, launched the final report of its major Inquiry into Scotlandrsquos Energy Future. The two-year project had a goal of assessing the pros and cons of the options available to meet Scotlandrsquos energy needs. This allowed a committee of independent experts to take evidence from a wide range of stakeholders including an open call for written evidence, public engagement events across Scotland, and numerous meetings with government, industry and third sector organisations. The report considers Scotlandrsquos current energy landscape, analysis of the future options available to meet energy demand, and the governance of our energy system.The RSE Energy Inquiry report makes a number of recommendations.However, perhaps its most important point is that there is no silver bullet. , Professor Rebecca Lunn , Professor Simon Harley, Professor Gareth Harrison, Professor Gavin Little, Professor Stephen McArthur, Professor Peter Smith, Professor Karen Turner , Professor John Underhill  Professor Janette Webb\" alt\"HeraldScotland: Committee Members, Sir Muir Russell, Professor Rebecca Lunn , Professor Simon Harley, Professor Gareth Harrison, Professor Gavin Little, Professor Stephen McArthur, Professor Peter Smith, Professor Karen Turner , Professor John Underhill  Professor Janette Webb\" class\"editor-image\"Committee Members, Sir Muir Russell, Professor Rebecca Lunn , Professor Simon Harley, Professor Gareth Harrison, Professor Gavin Little, Professor Stephen McArthur, Professor Peter Smith, Professor Karen Turner , Professor John Underhill  Professor Janette WebbThere are no easy answers to the enormous challenge we face. If we cannot signicantly reduce energy demand, which must clearly be a government priority, we may need to double or even treble our low-carbon electricity production. For example, current government policy aims to reduce carbon emissions from transportation by switching to electric vehicles. However, while such a move is certainly necessary, it is not sufficient.The additional electricity required to power our electric cars must somehow be produced, and by low carbon methods .One option to reduce carbon emissions from domestic heating is to convert all our heating systems to run on hydrogen gas. However, based on current technologies, we can only produce sufficient hydrogen by manufacturing it from methane, a process which produces carbon dioxide.Hence, we would still need to invest in technologies for capturing and storing the carbon dioxide. This may prove expensive, so who should pay  Scotland already has a high percentage of households in fuel poverty ndash % in .Read more about our Climate For Change initiative in Business HQ, online every quarterFuture energy policy must consider a wide range of possibilities within the framework of the ldquoenergy quadrilemma ndash climate change, affordability, energy security, and providing energy in a just and sustainable way.Dficult decisions are unavoidable and must be made by our elected officials in a transparent and honest way one which looks at Scotlandrsquos needs, and its social and ethical responsibilities in the round, and decides what the best energy mix should be.The danger of not meeting the challenge head-on is that Scotland, and the wider UK, do not produce enough energy to meet future requirements and rely increasingly on importing energy from overseas. When we import energy, which already accounts for % of UK primary supply, we have no control over its carbon footprint, nor over the ethics, social justice and environmental impacts at the point of its production. We also leave ourselves vulnerable to major geopolitical crises that could result in energy shortages.One of the primary outcomes of the RSE Energy Inquiry is the need to raise the level of informed, evidence-based discussion around energy policy and its impacts. Too often debate on how we source and use energy focuses narrowly on inidual technologies and theirdrawbacks.Public opinion is also influenced by the ldquonot in my back yard problem of not siting production sites near people.As we look to meeting this global challenge, an important facet of ldquodoing things dferently should be to facilitate a wider and more meaningful discussion on why we need energy, how we use it and from where we source it. There will be no perfect or easy solution. Decisions will inevitably have consequences, and signicant financial investment will unquestionably be required, but these realities cannot be allowed to hinder the mature and considered debate that is needed.To this end, a key recommendation of the RSE report is the establishment of an independent expert advisory commission on energy policy and governance. If given the requisite authority and resources, such a commission would provide the Scottish Government, legislators and regulators with integrated and impartial advice. It could also address related areas such as fuel poverty, climate change mitigation, economic development, environmental protection, planning, transport, community development and public health.An independent, credible and trusted body providing this sort of guidance could play a key role in strengthening public and political discourse on energy.Professor Rebecca Lunn is Deputy Chair, Royal Society of Edinburgh Energy Inquiry, University of StrathclydeThe HeraldrsquosClimate for Changeinitiative supports efforts being made by the ScottishGovernmentwith key organisations and campaign partners.

People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling. The aim of that p will be to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.#Our new figures reveal how Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Orkney Islands,# said Zero Waste Scotland#s chief operating officer, Jill Farrell.#We all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches. The great thing about Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme is it will give people a p incentive to do the right thing with their empty bottles — take them back for recycling, rather than risk them ending up on our streets or in our rivers.#Litter isn’t just an eyesore — it also pollutes our environment and seas. And for every bottle littered, more plastic has to be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions. When you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, you’ll not just be getting your p back — you’ll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.#Further figures from Zero Waste Scotland also show that Orkney goes through an estimated . million plastic bottles every year. An estimated , plastic bottles are littered in the county each year. With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials included in the scheme. This would mean , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Orkney Islands each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher.

Volunteer cleaners become citizen scientists, as they also record the litter they find along a designated m stretch of every beach that’s cleaned, and it’s this aspect that has helped MCS change policy and behaviours over the last  years.“Now more than ever is the time to turn awareness into action,# says Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland conservation officer. #Everybody is talking about marine litter — you see it on the TV, hear it on the radio and read it in the papers and across social media. We want people to take that awareness and turn it into action by taking part in the biggest beach litter survey and clean up in Scotland! Only by combining awareness with action and data can we make sure that industry and government put in place the urgent measures needed to stop this plastic tide for good.”The p carrier bag charge, a ban on microbeads in wash-off products, consultations on a plastic tax, commitments to depositschemes, a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds in Scotland and the banning of lantern and balloon releases — have all come about following compelling evidence gathered over decades by volunteers at MCS beach cleans. Cleaning and surveying a beach only takes a couple of hours at most. Each beach has a coordinator, who explains how to fill in a simple data form, and then it’s just a case of grabbing a litter picker and a bin bag and filling it up with rubbish.“Beach litter is a serious environmental problem,” says Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer.“But the solution is in our hands. We want the th Great British Beach Clean weekend to be the biggest ever. The BBC’s Blue Planet II and subsequent programmes have given the UK public a real understanding of the pollution crisis facing our oceans and now people want to make a dference. The more volunteers we have, the better it’ll be for our seas.”To get involved, call   and find out how you can organise your own.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney’s MSP highlighted the government’s continued failure to find a solution to the islands’ internal ferry services, including replacement vessels, and the lack of progress on implementing RET on external services, a year on from the promised start date. Mr McArthur said: “The National Islands Plan will be important in mapping out the areas where improvements are needed to secure a vibrant future for our island communities.“During the passage of the legislation, I moved amendments making clear that one of the most urgent priorities would be delivering changes and improvements to leline ferry services to meet the needs of people and businesses in Orkney.“This seems to be the message that is coming through loud and clear in the consultation, as demonstrated by the recent response from the NFUS.  It will come as a surprise to no one but should act as a clear signal to ministers that the continued failure to act is unacceptable.“We need a sustainable and long term solution to the funding and operation of our internal ferry services, on which some of our most fragile communities rely. This includes replacement vessels for a fleet that is ageing and no longer fit for purpose.“In addition, more than a year on from the date on which RET was supposed to be introduced, we seem no nearer seeing the reduction in fares. Those using these services are therefore continuing to pay over the odds. That is not good enough.“Having initiated the consultation, the government now have an obligation to act.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Sadly, many are under threat from coastal erosion and the effects of climate change.“SCHARP is doing brilliant work engaging communities with this issue and working to identy and protect sites across Scotland, including a number here in Orkney.  Without the work of volunteers, however, this would simply not be possible. Those who get involved, devoting their time, energy and local knowledge, are due an enormous debt of gratitude.“For example, volunteers in Sanday helped to move and rebuild eroding structures from the Meur Burnt Mound to the local heritage centre, preserving an important cultural and historical attraction. This is just one example of the invaluable work carried out by volunteers that will allow current and future generations a better understanding of their heritage.“I know there is similar great work being undertaken in communities across Scotland and I’ve written to my MSP colleagues encouraging them to find out more about what is happening in their constituencies and regions. The summer recess provides a perfect opportunity to get out and learn more about these projects and the volunteers that make them possible.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Shetland football matches for the Milne Cup dating back to Jockie Wood£ . tax incl.One Hundred Glorious Games is the title chosen to describe the milestone just reached in the annual football fixture between teams representing Orkney and Shetland. But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football. And make up your own mind about the glorious bits!Jockie WoodNo customer reviews for the moment.* Required fields"},{"url":null,"title":"terms of service  \n","story":"Terms of ServiceLast Updated:   These terms of serviceapply to your access and use of our apps and websites.

It was by no means certain they would get it – with  per cent having their requests turned down – and the average payout was £. One of the main reasons for applications was that people had spent their benefits or income and run out of money.Everyone has a personal responsibility to live within their means and the state simply cannot afford to fund the lestyles of prodigal citizens who refuse to do so and there is always likely to be a small minority of claimants who try to game the system. But the vast majority of cases will be genuine.: Boris Johnson tries to turn focus from Brexit with pledges to boost northern EnglandFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereEver since the  crash, there has been growing concern about in-work poverty with some employers paying below the ‘living wage’ – effectively relying on their staff to claim ‘top-up’ benefits, which could be seen as a form of state subsidy for people’s wages, or get a second or even a third job.The growing discontent about standards of living – not just among the poorest – is a serious problem that must be addressed by politicians of all parties. The failure to do so was undoubtedly one reason for the Brexit referendum result. Boris Johnson’s announcement in Manchester of £. billion for ‘left-behind towns’ may be seen as a populist move, but it was at least a recognition of the need for action. The mere acknowledgement that some places have been “left behind” will be welcomed by many who feel exactly this way.But, ultimately, this is a serious problem that is unlikely to be solved by major spending projects by government – whether at Holyrood or Westminster – but by improving the economic performance of the country as a whole. And governments – at local, Scottish and UK level – have a vital role to play in ensuring this happens and duty to co-operate with each other to this end.So it was disappointing that the immediate reaction to the Welfare Fund figures was an attempt to sht blame. Our politicians need to work together to solve this country’s problems, whether they are ones of high finance or more mundane concerns, like the cost of nappies for an infant.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"what scottish unionists can learn from decline of quebec s separatists murdo fraser","story":"Quebec demonstrates that it is possible for unionists to see off an independence movement evenit seems unstoppable, writes Murdo Fraser.It is always useful to look at international and historical comparisons for the challenges we face in Scotland today. One part of the world that has faced similar constitutional issues to ours is the largely Francophone province of Quebec, which held two referendums on the question of independence , in  and . Whilst on both occasions the vote went against separation, in  it did so by the tightest of margins, with just one per cent between the winning and losing totals.Since , however, the notion of independence for Quebec has slipped down the political agenda, with a collapse in support both for it as a concept, and for the separatist Parti Quebecois.In the most recent provincial election last October, the once-dominant PQ secured just  per cent of the vote, with the winner being the soft-nationalist Coalition Avenir Quebec .What explains this turnaround in little more than  years  Simply, Quebecers tired of the constitutional argument. A younger generation in the province, still proud of their Quebec heritage, became more comfortable with the notion of being Canadian, secure in the view that a strong federal system protected local decision-making.There is little doubt that the constitutional debates had an economic impact. The banking centre of Canada moved from Montreal to Toronto, largely due to concerns over Quebec separation. A legacy of those times is the irony that today the Bank of Montreal is headquartered not in the city whose name it bears, but in English-speaking Toronto.The debate over Quebec’s future had consequences too for the local electoral landscape. With a first-past-the-post voting system, there was little point in the federalist, pro-Canada parties splitting the anti-separatist vote any more than was necessary. : Nicola Sturgeon challenges Boris Johnson to live TV debate on independenceFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereSo the Conservative Party of Canada, despite its electoral successes at a federal level, does not contest elections to the Quebec National Assembly. Instead, Quebec Conservatives vote for the Quebec Liberal Party, which despite its name has been independent of the Canadian Liberals – the party of Justin Trudeau – since , and sits somewhat to their right on economic issues.These arrangements are perhaps best illustrated in the long career of the Quebec politician Jean Charest. Charest started his journey as a Conservative in Canada’s federal Parliament in Ottawa, serving as leader of the party there from  to . Then, on the invitation of the Quebec Liberals, he left the federal Parliament – and the Canada Conservatives – to become the provincial Liberal leader, in which position he went on to be elected as Premier of Quebec. He served in that role from -, winning an unprecedented three election victories.While the notion of dferent political parties at dferent levels might seem unusual to us, it is the norm across Canada. Centre-right, pro-Canada Quebecers have no dficulty in voting one way in a federal election, and quite dferently in a provincial one.So what might we in Scotland learn from all this  Firstly, there is nothing inevitable about independence or constitutional change. It might have seemed to Quebecers in the s that nothing would stop the separatist juggernaut, but the voters simply tired of the constitutional debate.Voter fatigue is something we are becoming familiar with. My sense of where we are with Brexit is that there is a growing demand that politicians “just get it over with”. There is little appetite to re-open the independence question here while the Brexit question is still unresolved, and even then I wonder whether the public will be enthusiastic about yet another round of constitutional debate.Secondly, we should not assume that our current political party structures are either optimal, or set to last for ever. Boris Johnson’s appointment as Prime Minister has reignited the debate over whether there should be a separate Scottish Conservative Party, an idea I put forward in  when I stood for the party leadership .Notwithstanding my views on the issue at that time, to me the notion that we should split from the Conservative Party as a reaction to Boris’s election as UK leader is as daft an idea as the SNP’s claim that this is an argument for independence. The Union has lasted for more than  years, it has been substantially to the benefit of Scotland to have been part of it for that time, both economically and socially, and to dismantle it as a knee-jerk response to the identity of any one holder of the office of Prime Minister, and lose these advantages as a consequence, would be ridiculous.Moreover,Boris can deliver an orderly Brexit, he may well end up governing the UK as a true One-Nation Conservative. A look at his record in office as mayor of London suggests that is entirely possible, and some of his early announcements – for example on dropping his predecessor’s misguided immigration targets – have been warmly welcomed by Scottish Conservatives.I understand the concerns of Conservative colleagues who don’t want to change our relationship with the UK party. I also appreciate that I have MP colleagues who want to be part of a bigger team, and feel that their constituents should have the right to vote directly for the party of Government in a Westminster election. But,we were to adopt a Canadian model of political parties, that would all still be possible. The key battleground ahead for us is  – the Scottish Parliament elections – where a victory for the SNP with a majority of seats at Holyrood for pro-independence parties will lead to them claiming a mandate for a second referendum. The priority for unionists, of all parties, must be to defeat them in that objective.The lesson of politics in Quebec is that when the forces of federalism come together they can see off the threat of separation. If it worked there, it could work here. At least we should be considering whether the Canadian approach is one we can learn from.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"sajid javid unveils 2 1bn in funding to prepare for brexit","story":"An additional #. billion of government spending to prepare for Brexit has been announced, doubling the amount of funding in a further sign of the growing risk of a no-deal exit from the EU.Chancellor Sajid Javid confirmed an immediate £.bn cash injection for Whitehall departments and devolved administrations, with another £bn in reserveneeded.The money will pay for  additional border guards and measures to secure the supply of medicines.But the spree has already been challenged by MPs on the parliamentary spending watchdog, which warned that there was “not enough time” to spend the funds effectively before  October.Mr Javid said: “With  days until the UK leaves the European Union it’s vital that we intensy our planning to ensure we are ready.“We want to get a good deal that abolishes the anti-democratic backstop. Butwe can’t get a good deal, we’ll have to leave without one.“This additional £.bn will ensure we are ready to leave on  October – deal or no deal.”The announcement came as Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Northern Ireland on the third leg of a UK-wide tour to promote the Union, meeting with the five main parties involved in talks to restart devolved power-sharing.After days of tough rhetoric from Downing Street and ministers who insist the UK will not restart Brexit talks until the EU agrees to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, DUP leader Arlene Foster picked up the baton, accusing Brussels of being “belligerent” and trying to “break up the UK”.Mr Javid’s announcement means a total of £.bn has been set aside to prepare for Brexit.Some £ million will go towards border and customs operations, bringing the total number of border officers added this year to , and boosting capacity to process UK passport applications.More money will be available for training of customs agents, and to invest in IT systems that will make completion of customs declarations easier.Transport infrastructure around ports will be improved, and an additional £ million will be spent to increase ca­pacity for the stockpiling \u2028of medicines and medical products.There will also be an extra £m to boost public communications around getting ready for Brexit.Departments and devolved administrations will be able to bid for an additional £bnthey face further challenges.Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the announcement was an “appalling waste of taxpayers’ cash, all for the sake of Boris Johnson’s drive towards a totally avoidable no deal.“This government could have ruled out no deal, and spent these billions on our schools, hospitals, and people,” Mr McDonnell said.The spending will be probed by the Commons Public Accounts Committee when parliament s from the summer recess, chairwoman Meg Hillier announced.The Labour MP told the Evening Standard: “The Prime Minister is promising to throw hundreds of millions of pounds at Brexit as though that will solve his problems.“With three months to go before  October there’s not enough time to spend this effectively – recruiting, training and delivering services takes more planning.“The Public Accounts Committee will be looking at how much is spent and what it actually delivers.”Downing Street has said Mr Johnson’s Europe adviser will hold talks with senior EU officials in Brussels to deliver the message that the UK will leave the EU on  October “whatever the circumstances”.David Frost will meet key figures following his appointment as the Prime Minister’s “sherpa” for talks with the EU.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the trust has now secured another £, to fund a project officer to take the Skye cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port. A breakwater will allow us to provide overnight berths and efficient, comfortable transfer for cruise ship passengers, while a visitor centre will provide a warm highland welcome to visitors from across the globe. This project will be transformational for Portree and surrounding areas.#The community trusts of Skye and Lochalsh all have several features in common. They have vision, ambition, energy and drive and they are full of volunteers who are committed to bringing long-term projects to fruition for the benefit of their community # and their visitors # for decades to come."},{"url":null,"title":"chance to visit eden project","story":"Community minded people in Mid  East Antrim who want to make good happen where they live are invited to apply for a special weekend at the famous Eden Project in Cornwall.There they will have the opportunity to share inspiration and bring home ideas to implement in their neighbourhood.Thanks to people who play the National Lottery, successful applicants will have accommodation and transport along with the weekend community camp costs all paid for.

The play shows a time in history of the bitterness of some people captured through Marie’s writing during that football match. I know there is a percentage on both sides of people who still hold a bit of resentment but hopefully the majority of us have moved on and this piece shows what can happen when we do move on.“This is the first time I’ve done something like this, something on this scale, and it’s the same show, basically on people’s doorstep at the Devenish. We finished a fantastic run at the Lyric Theatre, the Féile is also part of our tour before we head to Derry. The Irish Arts Centre in New York came to see it in the Lyric and there is talk of taking it over to the States for the Irish Arts Festival in February.”Gerard continued: “If people with tickets for the s Night which is happening as part of Féile want to come to the show first, then we wanted to put it out in the Andersonstown News that they can get a ticket half pricethey show their ticket at the door or contact us via sodabreadtheatre@gmail – we can give them a code when booking.“We are really looking forward to bringing the piece to the Devenish and hearing people’s reaction to the work.”A Night in November will be performed at the Devenish Complex on Sunday, August .

They are intent on pursuing a strategy to undermine workers’ pay, terms and conditions as well as imposing price hikes excluding lower income users. There is now a substantial two-tier workforce with increasing numbers of casual workers coming in on poverty pay rates while those previously employed by Belfast City Council are being denied pay uplts, leaving their wages fall ever closer to the legal minimum.“The community has been left behind as well. Last year Unite called a protest against the price hikes and attacks on workers’ pay and conditions on the peaceline which drew signicant cross-community support from both the Shankill and Falls. Working class people are united in their opposition to the council’s austerity-driven policies on leisure services.“Belfast City Council voted to outsource leisure services to this company – they cannot wash their hands of the consequences of that for either the public or their former employees. We call on all parties to reconsider their positions and bring these public services back in-house and give all the GLL workers a decent pay uplt.”A spokesperson for GLL said the company would meet union representatives to “understand the issues they have”.“GLL remains committed to genuine engagement on these matters in the interests of all parties, and to ensure the seamless provision of services across all of our leisure centres,” the spokesperson added.A Belfast City Council spokesperson said: “Belfast City Council is disappointed to learn that strike action is being considered at the city’s leisure centres. Council is committed to working with GLL, its employees and their representatives to ensure the continued provision of leisure services to all our ratepayers across Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"casement park decision due by the end of year","story":"THE long awaited planning decision for the redevelopment of Casement Park is anticipated to be made before the end of this year.

DfC are working on the business case to try and find where that additional money will come from. Once the planning decision has been made it means we won’t be sitting further more years waiting on the business case being drawn up,” he said. Mr Maskey said he would be “very disappointed”the planning decision was not made within the next five months. “In all likelihood, in the absence of a minister, it will be DfI’s Permanent Secretary Katrina Godfrey making the decision.”When asked what would he say to those in the community who think Casement will never be built Mr Maskey said: “We are pushing for Casement to get built – I can understand that people say this will never be done because its been frustrating for so long, it has taken all these years to get the project to this stage. “I think the negavity around the project has reduced over the years. The new design has come in, there has been a lot of hard work done behind the scenes to try and get this major investment for West Belfast through. “The GAA have assured us that all the information needed is all in, that there are no outstanding issues at this stage. “There should be nothing that stalls this project back any further.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"family of joe burns raise over 3000 in","story":"THE family of a popular barman at The Chester have surpassed the £, mark in their fundraising efforts to keep his memory alive.Joe Burns died suddenly five years ago in July , aged just  after collapsing at his parent’s home.Joe was a fit and healthy boxer who trained regularly at the gym.Tragically, the day after his death, his girlfriend Sinead discovered she was pregnant with their daughter Bella who is now four-years-old.Soon after Joe’s death, his family learned Joe’s mum Una and sister Jeanette both carry the faulty gene for Long QT, an inherited condition that can cause heart rhythm disturbances. Left undiagnosed, it can cause sudden death where someone has an unexpected cardiac arrest.Every year since, Joe’s family and friends take part in the annual Belfast Marathon, with all proceeds going towards the British Heart Foundation who use the money to fund research into silent heart conditions.This year,  members of Joe’s family and friends raised £, from their Marathon efforts. Their recent fundraising efforts have brought their overall total since Joe’s death to an amazing £, for the charity.Joe’s sister Jeanette O’Neill said: “This is the third year we have taken part in the Belfast Marathon for the BHF in Joe’s memory. Each year we just keep getting bigger and better with more people from our community getting involved through the full marathon, fun run and relay.“When Joe died our family was absolutely devastated. He was a real character and everyone knew him. He made such a big impact on so many people and it’s amazing that so many of his friends are still so supportive and want to help our fundraising efforts.“We don’t want what happened to our family to happen to any other family so that’s why we fundraise for the BHF because their research into conditions like Long QT are making such a big dference.”Jeanette said they have been overwhelmed by the support from their local community since Joe’s death.“Friends and family have just been fantastic. We are also hugely grateful to the Thunderdome in Glengormley for hosting a buffet for Joe’s runners after the marathon.

Those included Foyle Jobs and Benefits Office on Asylum Road, Carlisle House on Carlisle Road and Orchard House on Foyle Street from early morning until .am.After the picket lines, members gathered for a rally at the City Hotel which began at .am.The -hour strike was organised to highlight an imposed “pay deal” of .% and changes to terms and conditions of employment which union officials claim have been implemented without proper and meaningful consultation.Ms Gates addressed the rally along with Gerry Murphy, President of Irish Congress of Trade Unionsand Niall McCarroll, Chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council .Mr McCarroll addressed a packed room at the City Hotel where he said all workers had taken action to bring about better working conditions.He said the Tory government was “attacking working class communities” and it is time to “fight back” by building solidarity amongst workers. “Let us together build up a working-class spirit and let the Tories know we can bring them down.”Meanwhile, Ms Gates was keen to dispel the notion of civil servants having well-paid “cushy jobs” as an “absolute myth”. She added: “There are civil servants relying on tax credits, second jobs, credit cards to bring them to the end of the month or to pay off debts and those using food banks.”She praised those in the room for leading the way, recognising that many,not all of them, could ill afford to go without pay for the day. “We have to say, enough is enough, they can’t keep piling work on us and saying they can’t even give us a decent pay increase.“Many workers are % worse off than ten years ago in real terms.”Referring to legal action which has been initiated for “failure to consult”, she informed those in attendance, that the judge has decided to forego a pre-hearing by instead fixing a court date.She added that there will be a “few white faces” in the Department of Finance who know their actions have been “discriminatory” as they have been “acting outside the law”.

She demanded a living wage for all.A motion was put forward by People Before Profit at last month’s full Council meeting calling on the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Finance to provide a “fair and just settlement” which was backed by all councillors.

It is perched above the Co Donegal village of Burt and attracts thousands of visitors every year.The fort is a powerful manestation of what remains of ancient Ireland and on a clear day, from its pinnacle, it is possible to get a glimpse of three counties-Donegal, Derry and Tyrone. The commanding and spectacular waterways of Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle lie to its west and east respectively.But, in the th Century the fort, once home to kings of old Gaelic order, was rapidly disintegrating towards extinction. It was however saved by the vision of one man who spearheaded its restoration just over  years ago.Dr Walter Bernard was born on May ,  at Newmarket, Co Cork. His father was a captain in the th Rles, a regiment of the British Army and was amongst the reinforcements that arrived in Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo in June of  but was apparently too late to take part in the famed history changing conflict.Walter became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland in , a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in  and Fellow of that college in .Between - Dr Bernard served as a surgeon throughout the Crimean War attending the wounded British soldiers at Inkerman and witnessed the ravages caused by small pox and cholera. He later recalled that for every man that was shot, fty more were killed by those diseases, particularly in the notoriously harsh winters of  and .On the journey home from the Ukranian battlefields, he saved a man from drowning and was awarded with a certicate from the Royal Humane Society. Then, with his experiences of military conflict at an end, Dr Bernard landed back in Ireland and settled in Buncrana before building up a very large medical practice in Derry. He ran this surgery for over sixty years and was a prominent member of the city’s branch of the British Medical Association as well as holding many public offices throughout his career.One such appointment was to examine the quality of water in the city for Londonderry Corporation at public facilities such as the Creggan reservoirs built in stages between -, and which supplied much of the city’s domestic and industrial water needs.His experience of the waterborne disease cholera in the Crimea made him an ideal candidate for this job.Dr Bernard also addressed the Medical Society of King and Queens College of Physicians on the issuer of diphtheria in April . He cautioned the assembled medics that there was a reason why the disease was largely absent from statistics sheets.He said: “There are few diseases about which so many mistakes in diagnosis are made.”He feared the misdiagnosis rate was so high that it was almost impossible to ensure that ‘true diphtheria’ was as common in a town as reported.Dr Bernard added: “Diphtheria occurs in Londonderry, I have no doubt whatever…in my practice it has been my lot to treat many cases of this disease.”At some point in , Dr Bernard paid a visit to Grianan of Aileach and many years later in , he said of the experience: “Seventeen years ago, when this traditional and historical place was first visited by me, I found it in a very ruinous condition, and from that time I commenced to take an interest in its associations.“Year after year I witnessed further advance of its ruin, and I clearly saw thatsomething were not soon done to arrest the progress of its destruction, it would be in a few years a thing of the past.”Grianan of Aileach is a hilltop fort that sits on top of Greenan Mountain in Inishowen just over  feet above ground level.The ringfort was thought to have been built in the sixth or seventh century, although there is some evidence to suggest that the site had been in use before that.Greek astronomer and cartographer Ptolemy penned a remarkably accurate map of Ireland in  A.D. from which maps were later created in the th and th centuries. He called the land ‘Iouernia’, thought to mean ‘abundant land’ from which the Irish names Eriu and Eire are derived. Amongst two sites identied as ‘regia’ or royal places in Ireland by the Greek map maker, one of them is believed by some historians to be the Grianan of Aileach.Whether Ptolemy pinpointed it or not, the Kingdom of Aileach was indeed one of Ireland’s royal sites of the Gaelic order. The fort was thought to have been constructed originally by the northern section of the Ui Neill clan, but between  A.D. and the thirteen centuries, over  kings from ious clans, some also High Kings of Ireland, held the throne of Aileach. The last man to be known as the King of Aileach was Aed Buide Ua Neill who died in .Despite ious interpretations, it is generally agreed that Aileach means ‘stony place’ and the word Grianan means ‘sunny place’ so that Grianan of Aileach broadly translates as ‘The Stone Palace of the Sunny View’.Whatever the actual meaning of its name, it is evident that it was an extremely important place. Aileach’s political and strategic importance was such that the annals of Irish history record that it was attacked at least three times. In , Finsnechta Fledach, King of Ireland, destroyed the fort.Again, in , when Muirchertach MacNeill was king, Viking raiders sacked the site when they settled at Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. It’s also thought that King Brian Boru came to Aileach in , but it was destroyed once more in , when another King of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briaincame to Inishowen and plundered the region and razed the fort. The fort was laid to waste by O’Brien in revenge for O’Neill’s destruction of his royal seat at Kincora and he reportedly told his soldiers to each take a stone from the Donegal hillside so the place would be reduced to rubble.The fort itself could have served two main s both as a defensive and a ceremonial one and moreover as a settlement that was surrounded by ringforts of lesser importance. Whatever its actual , it is known that buildings of this nature were very rare in North West Ulster and its presence signies that its inhabitants were regarded as being very important.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe linking of St Patrick to the site is seen as attempt by Christian converts to place it firmly in that tradition whilst acknowledging its pagan history and the naming of a holy well right outside the ringfort in honour of Ireland’s patron saint seems to confirm that.There is also a mythological and folklore version of the founding of Grianan of Aileach which says the ringfort was built by Dagda , a god and the king of the Tuatha De Danann-the supposed ‘Tribe of the Gods’-a supernatural race in Irish mythology. The Tuatha De Danann are said to have invaded Ireland before the Celts and built strategic stone forts on the tops of hills.Dagda was said to have fought the Second Battle of Moytirra against the Fomorians and the fort at Aileach was built over the grave of his son Aedh who had been murdered.In , a Derry based group called the Irish Irelanders, enthusiastic Gaelic revivalists travelled to the site on Sunday afternoons and carried out some repairs. But, the splendour and historical intrigue of Grianan of Aileach had largely been ignored for many years until in , Dr Walter Bernard decided to begin its restoration in earnest.In the s, painter, musician, antiquarian and archaeologist George Petrie examined Grianan of Aileach when he was head of the Royal Irish Academy’s antiquities committee which was linked to the Irish Ordnance Survey.Petrie’s findings suggested that the hill many have been enclosed by many other ramparts and a line of stones leading up to the entrance which were all gone by then.But, despite his efforts, the expert’s findings remained confined to the records of the Royal Irish Academy, there were no efforts by the organisation to attempt any restoration of the ancient site.It was Dr Bernard who took practical action beyond the analysis of the site. He paid for the entire project that took place between - and recruited his crew of labourers from the farms surrounding Burt. They ferried the materials needed for the restoration on the back up small carts up supplied by the local landowners up the incredibly steep hill.What the doctor found at the site was a disorganised mess of which he said it was: “An immense circular heap of stones, with its grey fallen masonry scattered over the interior-no vestige of a wall, entrance passage, or central building.”Remembering that Walter Bernard was a medical doctor with no detailed description of what an ancient ringfort truly looked like and that there weren’t enough stones on site to complete the job, makes this story even more remarkable.Dr Bernard discovered many animal bones on the site including sheep, cows and goats and items like sling stones and warrior’s clubs. The most interesting stone object discovered was a ‘slab of sandstone, chequered into thirty-six squares’, believed to be a games board of some type.The doctor and his crew of labourers used the measurements of other Irish forts such as Staigue Fort in Co Kerry as the comparative basis for the restoration project at Grianan of Aileach. The finished product is a fort that stands . metres in diameter and more than five metres tall with walls that are almost four metres thick.Dr Bernard later described a part of the building project by saying: “To bind our work into a complete unity we had to gather around the hill about  or  loose stones-certainly not more,so many-and to split from the adjoining rocks, cropping up through the heather,  coping stones. These are supposed to serve instead of those removed by King Murdock O’Brien in .”Only speculation can be used to assessthe interior of today’s fort accurately resembles its ancient predecessor, but when the alternative was the complete disappearance of the Iron Age construction, then surely Bernard’s efforts become even more admirable.The fort has stood for centuries as a silent witness to major events of Irish history. From the top of Grianan fort you can just make out the location of the Co Donegal village of Rathmullen on the western bank of Lough Swilly.It was from Rathmullen in  that the chieftains Hugh O’Neill and Rory O’Donnell sailed with their families after the final defeat by the English taking with them the last symbols of the old Gaelic order once enshrined in its pomp by places such as Grianan of Aileach. Behind them in the distance the old fort sat on its hilltop as a fading reminder of a society and its traditions that would never .A legend says that in a secret cave on a hill beneath Grianan O’Neill’s warriors rest in a bewitched sleep in full armour and sitting on their horses ready for the next fight. The spell, says the legend, will only be broken when the next destined leader of Ulster arrives to lead them to victory.It is a myth that would have no visible attachmentit had not been for the passion of Dr Walter Bernard in the late th century in restoring Grianan of Aileach to something approaching its former glory.A tourist road to the fort was opened on September ,  by President of Ireland Eamon De Valera who was accompanied by Fine Gael TD for Donegal West, Pat O’Donnell, then Minister for Local Government. In the early s the Office of Public Works in the Republic of Ireland carried out further repairs to Grianan of Aileacgh after a wall collapsed. But as late as October  the Irish Government was being severely criticised by political representatives in Donegal for still failing to establish tour guides and other facilities at the ancient site.In his obituary contained in the Universities and Colleges magazine of December , , it was reported that Dr Bernard died suddenly at his residence in Buncrana on eight days previously on December . He was -years-old and was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Dr Bernard’s obituary ended: “He leaves a widow. His le was deeply scarred by three great sorrows, the deaths of his three children.”CAPTION: The volunteers involved in the restoration of Grianan of Aileach pictured at its official re-opening in ."},{"url":null,"title":"derrys new holiday inn express officially opens doors","story":"Derry’s newest hotel officially opened its doors for business yesterday and in the process brought with it over  jobs.The Holiday Inn Express on the city’s Strand Road represents a £ million investment in the city and the chain’s owners, Intercontinental Hotels Group , have said its presence will not just enhance employment but will create business opportunities for service providers across the region as well as in Derry city centre.With  bedroom’s the new hotel is now the second largest in the city and as well as having all the state-of-the-art facilities associated with modern hotels its central location is within walking distance of all the city’s main tourist attractions, bars and restaurants.General Manager Stephen Redden said that he is confident the new hotel will add to the vibrancy of the Strand Road and act as a compliment to existing and emerging businesses.“We are delighted to open the doors and add a fresh dimension to the city’s accommodation.

That included the expansion of Magee and the possibility of an independent university put forward by the DUG.The move followed an intervention by Labour Peer Lord Adonis who convinced the House of Lords to publish a report on the improvement of higher education provision in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a university whose principal campus is in Derry.A spokesperson for the Derry University Group said it is clear that the momentum for a dedicated university for the North West is growing all the time.“In recent months, Derry Strabane Council and other major influencers in Westminster and Dublin have committed themselves to delivering an independent university for the North West.“There has also been huge support from US colleges, who want to partner with a standalone university in Derry. It is completely apparent that the public here want action from the governments on a new university, now, as a matter of urgent priority.”“The North West, despite the political uncertainty, is in a prime position to establish a new cultural and educational institution, which could act as a catalyst for the economic regeneration of the region and reverse the damage already being done by Brexit on the Derry and Donegal communities.“The Derry University Group is willing to advise and assist Council and others in developing and delivering a new university, as we have always done in the past.

This impact was particularly felt in areas like here in Strabane where pride in the hunger strikers, their courage and sacrice still remains undiminished almost  years on.”The roots of what took place in  began several years earlier, when in  Belfast republican Kieran Nugent became the first man to refuse to wear a prison unorm. In , republicans had been accorded what the British termed Special Category Status recognising the political nature of their offences.By the mid-s however, political status had been withdrawn and as the cages of Long Kesh were replaced by the concrete H Blocks, the new British policy of ‘normalisation’ was wholly designed to strike any notion of political credence away from the IRA campaign.When he entered the H Blocks, Kieran Nugent was instructed to put a prison unorm on by the authorities. He answered, ‘you’ll have to nail it to my back.’ This began five years of protest inside the prison and heightened violence outside it which resulted in dozens of deaths.The blanket and no wash protests of the first four years of the prison conflict yielded no concessions on the issue of political status.The years of isolation and living in dire conditions eventually brought the situation to a head. The choice was plain and stark. The protesting republican prisoners could either concede and serve out jail sentences classed as ‘ordinary criminals’ or escalate the protest to the last ‘weapon’ available to them inside a prison-the hunger strike.It was not a new tactic for the republican movement, and it drew its inspiration from stories from the old Gaelic order.It’s recorded in the annals of Irish history that when a citizen felt slighted by the ruling order, it was not uncommon for them to lie outside their dwelling and refuse food in the hope of publicly shaming the guilty party into reparation and or an apology.In , Thomas Ashe died in Mountjoy prison in Dublin after being force fed whilst on hunger strike demanding political status. Then, in , the Lord Mayor of Cork Terence McSwiney died after  days whilst on hunger strike in Brixton jail. And, next year in  to mark the centenary of the death of McSwiney, the National Hunger Strike Commemoration will take place in Cork city.Back in , Michael Gaughan died in Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight after  days on hunger strike, and shortly before the beginning of the prison blanket and no wash protests in Long Kesh, in February , another Mayo man, Frank Stagg died at Wakefield jail in Yorkshire after  days without food.The first Long Kesh hunger strike began on October , . The protestors set out a list of five demands: -The right not to wear a prison unorm -The right not to do prison work -The right of free association with other prisoners -The right to organise their own educational and recreational facilities and -The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel a week.Seven men, including Sinn Fein MLA Raymond McCartney said they would fast to the death in the pursuit of the re-establishment of political status. Simultaneously, three female republican prisoners also embarked on a strike in Armagh jail.As Christmas  approached, the British offered a deal which appeared to agree to the central demand of the right not to wear a prison unorm. One of the hunger strikers, Sean McKenna was close to death at this stage and the strike was called off. It later emerged that was really being offered was a deal to allow prisoners to wear ‘civilian type clothing’ supplied by the prison regime. The scene was therefore already set for a second strike.It began on March ,  when Bobby Sands refused to eat. Raymond McCartney said: “Obviously everybody’s memory of  is the fact that ten people died on hunger strike.“On March ,  the British Government removed political status. I think most people thought that this was a half-hearted attempt and they’d roll over within a short period of time.“But, clearly what was emerging was a complete change in policy by the British Government who were intent on the idea of ‘normalisation’, ‘criminalisation’ and ‘Ulsterisation’.“Instinctively, any of us who found ourselves in prison at that time, knew we were political prisoners and any attempt to criminalise us just wasn’t going to work. It became a battle of wills.“But, I think by the end of the hunger strike in October, , most people looking on were saying that whatever was going on in the North that nobody in their wildest notion thought it was a criminal conspiracy. They certainly saw it as a political conflict. They may not have agreed with the armed actions of the IRA, but they certainly viewed it as a political situation.“So, for us by that stage, the process of criminalisation was in tatters. But, there was a very high price paid because  people had died in prison and  or  people had died on the streets.“Within the prisons we knew that we still had work to do because what we had to do was turn that acceptance of political imprisonment into every day conditions. By the end of the hunger strike I suppose there was a big recognition of the dference between the criminal’s unorm and our own clothes was one manestation of it. And, over the years we continued to ensure the conditions in Long Kesh reflected that.“By the late s and early s, journalists were frequent visitors to the prison and left with the overwhelming impression that we were a ‘dferent type’ of prisoner. They may have gone out and had questions about who you were and what you were about but they were in doubt that we were political prisoners. That was a big source of validation.”The intensity of the events and scale of death and destruction between  and  in retrospect now seems enormous, but Raymond McCartney maintains that it paved the way for future political developments.“It was only five years, but it was a very intense five years. It is only when you get a bit older you realise just how short a time span it was, because when you roll onto  and the Good Friday Agreement there was an acceptance of the framework that there was a political conflict which had to be resolved by political means-the recognition of political mandates, the political framework to address all these issues, but at the core of that was the acceptance of political prisoners.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“There is no doubt there is evidence that there were elements within the British Government were determined that political status should not be granted for whatever reason.“Even in , when there was internment without trial and up to , people were held in conditions where they wore their own clothes. There was a recognition of the political conflict of one nature or another.“How that was defined by dferent people is a dferent matter. I know that other people have made the observation that for too long the British tried to deal with the North as a security issue. therefore, when you have a security mentality or emergency laws, emergency courts, emergency interrogation centres, everything is changed and turned upside down.“If you follow their logic from that point of view and they say ‘you cannot now say you are political prisoners’ whilst trying to pretend that everything  about the situation isn’t political too then the penny drops in a whole lot of ways.”The almost  years since  have provoked much debate within wider nationalism about whether or not the hunger strike was harnessed as a catalyst for the republican movement to embark on the path to politics.The election of Bobby Sands to Westminster and Kieran Doherty to the Dail was followed quickly by a debate within Sinn Fein about ending their policy of abstentionism from political institutions that would lead to a split in the republican movement in . The Derry News asked Raymond McCartney for his view on this.He said: “It is interesting now, because everyone has their story about what the origins of the peace process was. But, there is absolutely no doubt that when you look back as far as  that Gerry Adams that there needed to be a political way of resolving the conflict, because military stalemate was exactly that.“The famous Glover Report from the British Army accepted that there was not going to be a military defeat, was them in their own way, saying the IRA was a political force and that the guys in Long Kesh were political prisoners. They job they were sent to do, they couldn’t do and that was to impose a military defeat and by extension their laws of oppression were not going to work either.“It made the situation painful and made the conflict last longer. Then, whenever the formula for the Good Friday Agreement was put forward, some former prisoners will tell you that it was too high a price to pay, but the core accepted it was a political problem and without political solutions it was never going to be resolved.”When the first hunger strike ended in October of , Raymond McCartney had gone without food for  days. So, what are his own personal recollections of the physical effects of what took place “I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.“In a very strange way hunger strike affects dferent people in dferent ways. Even the day the hunger strike ended in , I was still walking about, I was out of bed. But, there is no doubt that your body slows down.“My ability to see was greatly affected. But, the body is a remarkable piece of equipment and resilience is obviously built in. As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.“I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.

However, Raymond McCartney believes that her thinking was a lot wider than that.“Whatever her antipathy towards Ireland was and what came with that, she was setting out a broader political stall. Look at how she treated the miner’s later on.“Reading state papers now, years after these events, her take on the miner’s strike wasn’t just a battle about conditions in the mines, it was about strategically tackling trade unions. It was a case of her saying who is the strongest union-who is the spine of the working class and acting on that.“I always remember that being in jail gives you the time to reflect and read and think and I also always remember that Bobby Sands out of all the people who had been in jail was very clear about what he was there for because he wrote it all down. Some of the things he wrote captures the way a writer works-it’s all encompassing and puts it out there in a very vivid way.“I had previously been interned, I had an understanding about what being a political prisoner was. You had your own clothes and a bit of freedom to associate with other prisoners and you didn’t feel that sense of captivity although you were locked up. Bobby Sands caught on very early that the British were trying to defeat us in the prisons. It wasn’t just about trying to give you a hard time or denying you your own clothes, it was that they had a core idea to break us.“One of the rewarding things for me personally was that the system we had in the end in jail was one based on equality. That we treated people as equals. If you couldn’t treat the person beside you as a comrade and an equal that you couldn’t expect anyone  to believe that you’d treat all people as equals as you went on through le.”Those wishing to attend the th National Hunger Strike Commemoration are asked to assemble on Sunday, August  at .pm at the Diamond in Lford before marching across the border into Strabane where Martina Anderson MEP will deliver this year’s main oration.CAPTION: Raymond McCartney spent  days on hunger strike in ."},{"url":null,"title":"studio2 summer dance","story":"Greater Shantallow Community Arts are seeking participants for their annual Summer Dance Camp.If you are between --years-old this is a fantastic opportunity to take part in an two-week long exciting event.

No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell. The ground and houses nearby vibrated and caused house alarms to go off.“Some neighbours felt very intimidated, shocked and panicked with the suddenness, noise level and by the time of the morning it happened. The residents are up in arms. It should never have been allowed to happen as Council was made aware last year about their responsibility of a duty of care to work in the public interest. The residents feel unsupported to date in their endeavours to the Council.”Addressing the residents’ concerns, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that: “During the processing of the application,  objections have been received to the proposed development.“Correspondence to the Planning Department from Planning Consultant, Mr Lee Kennedy acting on behalf of the objectors, was received on August ,  and raised concerns regarding the trees on the site, and a request for a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderto be served on the site.“These concerns were raised with the Planning Department’s Tree Preservation Officer on September ,  who advised on September , that in his professional opinion, a TPO was not appropriate for this site given the nature, type and scale of trees.”On April  this year, Planning Department officials met with objectors at the city’s Council offices, where again, the Tree Preservation Officer advised that a TPO was considered but was unnecessary when assessed against the criteria required for a TPO.The Council spokesperson continued: “The site was further inspected by planning officers on June ,  and officers met with objectors on site.“More recently, the case officer wrote to the agent and the applicant on June ,  to advise that further information was required. Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"powys new head education appointed","story":"Dr Caroline Turner the new chief executive of Powys County Council, takes the heltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtlm on February .lt spangtlt spangt\" POWYS: Has new head of education been appointed Head of education, Dr Alec Clark\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"removing complication","story":"Be more active and to stick to your calorie deficit.\" Removing the Complication of it all, says Mark Davies of Zenith FitBe more active and to stick to your calorie deficit.\" Removing the Complication of it all, says Mark Davies of Zenith FitGet your training off to a great start with this special offer.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"burglary llanidloes see hear anything","story":"Library image of police tape\" Burglary in Llanidloes – did you see or hear anything Library image of police tape\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"re off race life llanfair caereinion   picture special","story":"Caereinion High School pupils and staff took part in the Race For Le -

If we all do a little bit, wersquoll ensure the service is maintained for today, tomorrow and future generations.Earlier this year, local politicians agreed to take the lead in securing financial support for the air ambulance service and also make a monetary contribution to help meet the servicersquos poundm annual running costs.The Department of Health allocates around poundm in annual funding to help keep the helicopter service in the air with money used to finance the air ambulance crew, medicines and medical equipment. Charity funds, including public donations, sustains the aviation side of the operation.It was announced recently that as part of the ongoing consultation on reshaping stroke services, the Department has made a commitment to extend the partnership with Air Ambulance Northern Irelandto enable the helicopter emergency medical service to provide a secondary response to incidents, including strokes, by .Health officials have also confirmed that any changes to the existing arrangement would be subject to the completion of an appropriate business case and agreement with the air ambulance with regard to any funding implications..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity Beer and Bubbles 5k run in Finnebrogue  ","story":"M B McGRADY  Co Chartered Accountants is setting the pace this September with the launch of the Beer and Bubbles k run in a bid to raise money for Air Ambulance NI.Open to competitors of all ages and experiences, the race will take place on Thursday, September , at Finnebrogue Woods, nestled on the outskirts of Downpatrick.This is the first k race to take place at the idyllic venue, with the route mapped out so runners take in the stunning woodland and finish close to the lakeside, where they will be able to soak up the atmosphere while enjoying a glass of local beer or prosecco.The event follows on from last yearrsquos successful M B Grady  Co Ultimate Aqua Challenge,.Conaill McGrady, director of M B McGrady  Co, said: ldquoWe are delighted to be supporting Air Ambulance NI for a second year and helping to contribute to maintaining the vital work that they do.

They opened the scoring through Gareth George and he added a free to give the visitors an early cushion.Indeed, Bright had plenty more chances to add to this score, but were wasteful in their shot selection. The Holywood men finally woke up and a tidy score from Connor McAnespie after  minutes opened their account.Bright again replied with a fine score from Marc Burke before Martin Cox opened his account for Holywood with a point after  minutes. Barry Kilkey levelled the contest three minutes later from close range and Freddie OrsquoConnor scored for Bright to edge them ahead again.Foolish tackling and unnecessary frees were costing St Paulrsquos in the game and helped Bright dominate the play In the first half.The gamersquos opening goal, however, swung the play towards the Holywood men again. Fantastic work from Seaacuten Tucker around the middle of the park and his long ball into the danger area found Marty Cox in space.Cox caught the ball in mid-air, landed and turned in one motion before smashing the ball past Michael Ferrand, who had no chance. The sizable crowd roared with delight and momentum was now with St Paulrsquos as Tucker added another score from play.Once again, however, ill discipline and poor tackling would cost St Paulrsquos. Paddy Falls high tackle left George with a handy free to cut the deficit before Tucker added a free from m out on the left.George added the final score of the half for Bright leaving St Paulrsquos two points clear at the half-time whistle - to -.Bright again took the early initiative at the start of the second half and a point by Rian Tempany set the early tone. A big talking point came at six minutes into the second half when referee John McMullan sent off two players, one from each team after an altercation at a break downThe next few scores were to and fro with Tucker scoring three points and George replying in kind, aided by Tempany. The game was tied at - to - drawing at  when St Paulrsquosadded their second goal in the th minute.Fine work from Daniel Eastwood and Cox set up Tucker who danced around two Bright defenders before slotting the ball home from  metres. The home crowd were again in raptures, expecting St Paulrsquos to see the game out.However, game management has been a big problem this season for the Holywood men, given the average age of the team is  it is perhaps understandable that experience to see games out is just not there yet.St Paulrsquos tried to slow the game down, but with about  minutes still to be played, it was far too early for that. Bright caught St Paulrsquos in possession on numerous occasionsand turned the ball over for score after score.George was a constant threat and punished each mistake by the Holywood men with a score.

He did, however, admit that the itinerary has been sent to Rome.Venues for the Popersquos visit are pure speculation and certainly newspapers are free to speculate, he added.It is understood that Downpatrick was one of the three venues north of the border suggested by the committee of  bishops, headed by Cardinal OrsquoFiaich, when they met last week.The decision on whether the Pope will include Northern Ireland in his tour will be taken in Rome, but it is believed that alternative venues in the Republic have been suggestedthe Pope decides not to cross the border.The choice of Downpatrick mdash with its strong historical links with Christianity and St Patrick mdash is understood to have been a move to give the Pope the opportunity to see as many people as possible.It is also thought that Armagh mdash the ecclesiastical headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland mdash and Londonderry were studied as possible venues for a visit.Until the programme is finalised, the only places certain to be included in the itinerary are Dublin and the Marian Shrine at Knock, County Mayo.Dr Joseph Maguire, Parish Priest of Downpatrick, said that he personally had not been contacted about any visit from Pope John Paul II, but he admitted that Downpatrick would have been one of the first places to think of.ldquoWe would be delighted to be so honoured with a visit from the Holy Father and he would be most welcome he said.KILLYLEAGH mdash A one-day token strike by production workers closed the Killyleagh Mill yesterday.Around  workers walked out, seeking a wages increase.

Two special zones will be developed for car parking on either side of the beach and a park for upwards of  cars will be provided in the centre, off the beach area.Under no circumstances, however, will cars be allowed to drive up and down the beach area and the council is expected to appoint full-time beach inspectors to supervise parking during the summer season.The private entrances presently used by beach-goers will be blocked off and two new public driveways will be constructed. It is thought that charges for cars to the beach will be scrapped.Other developments at the beach will include the provision of new toilet blocks and the construction of - self-catering holiday homes for renting.NEWCASTLE mdash A new peal of six church bells will ring out over Newcastle this year.

Many friendships were forged when Crusaders travelled to the Midlands last Thursday for the first leg tie of the Europa League qualying round which they lost -.Workers behind the scenes at Seaview where Crusaders are taking on Wolverhampton Wanderers of the Premier LeagueIn Belfast today, Crues fans hosted the English visitors as they made the most of their short trip across the Irish Sea. It might not be the most glamorous city the Wolves supporters will see on what is surely the first of many more European ventures, but the experience will live long in the memory..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button And despite the huge gap in status, a mutual respect has also been established between the management and backroom staff of both clubs.Crusaders general manager Bernard Thompson said the respect shown to Crusaders by Wolves has been “unreal,” and believes the benefits of the tie will last long after the final whistle. “Thankfully we have top-class facilities on site, and we have the staff and volunteers here who are able to put on an event for playing a team of this magnitude.“Around , fans are coming from Wolverhampton but only  have tickets for the game officially for the away section, with others availing of the corporate hospitality, so there are still well over , people without tickets who have travelled over just to be part of it.“It’s a cheap flight and Belfast is buzzing. There’s a real buzz around the bars with a lot of Wolverhampton fans enjoying themselves. Everyone is coming here to enjoy the day.”A heroic performance at Molineux saw Crusaders trailing a very respectable - until almost the last kick of the game when the home side stretched their lead.Mr Thompson said the preparations were the same as any other European fixture, but the thrill of taking on the team that finished seventh in the English top flight – just one place behind Manchester United – is something special. “The only dference in terms of the organisation for this game is the magnitude of it, but with Wolves coming it is a sell-out stadium.

He was looking around on each side of him for some guidance and then the only contribution was that some civil servant said it was ‘a personnel matter’. But clearly he was not aware of it and seemed genuinely surprised.“My hope and expectation is that he’ll find out about the details but I’d think it’s quite a hard sell to defend what has happened where you have a UK government office where the picture of the head of state is not permitted to be displayed.“If you go to an American government office, President Trump’s picture will be on display,you go to an Irish government building you will see the picture of the Irish president – and rightly so. This whole thing is bonkers.”The News Letter first asked the NIO questions about the issue on Monday morning. Despite several reminders, the NIO did not respond until late on Tuesday night, after appearing to carefully consider its response – yet the brief response avoided answering the questions.Emergency council meeting called over Harland and Wolff shipyard crisis Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Throughout yesterday, as the story was picked up by the Nolan Show, the Frank Mitchell Show and the Belfast , the NIO refused to offer any substantive comment and did not dispute the accuracy of the News Letter story.Then last night, within minutes of BBC Newsline reporting on the controversy, the NIO released a statement from Secretary of State Julian Smith. In it he said that he was “delighted to see a picture of Her Majesty in my office when I arrived at Stormont House for the first time”.The NIO later claried that his first day in Stormont House was last Friday.The News Letter spoke to a well-placed source who last night expressed “utter surprise” when told about what Mr Smith had said.Last week UUP peer Lord Rogan had tabled parliamentary questions about the issue.When the NIO was asked by this newspaper whether the Queen’s picture had suddenly reappeared in Mr Smith’s office as recently as last week, an NIO spokesman said that he did not know.Mr Smith’s comments contradict those of NIO minister Lord Duncan. Last week, in answer to a written House of Lords question from Lord Rogan, he said that in line with advice from the Equality Commission the NIO was sensitive to the display of “posters, pictures, portraits or other displays that are more closely associated with one or other of the communities”, a phrase which includes the Queen, and added: “I can confirm that the department takes steps to ensure no such images are displayed in Stormont House.”TUV leader Jim Allister said that the situation needed to be “addressed urgently” by Mr Smith. DUP MP Paul Girvan said that the NIO’s decision was “grossly offensive and disrespectful to many people here in Northern Ireland”.It is not yet clear whether the portraits were removed because that was necessary under equality law or whether the NIO went far beyond what the law demands.However, in an indication of how the decision has the potential to undermine support for equality laws, Mr Girvan characterised the decision as “the outworking of the so-called ‘equality agenda’ that lies at the heart of the Belfast Agreement”.Last night Ulster-born Labour MP Kate Hoey said that “all the other pictures of Her Majesty must be put back” and said the episode raised questions for the NIO’s top official, Sir Jonathan Stephens.try catch  TrendingUpdated: PSNI probe sudden death of teenagerManarrested in N.I. on suspicion of sexual activity with a child arrested in N.I. on suspicion of sexual activity with a child\"N.I. mankilled in serious road traffic collision killed in serious road traffic collision\"Three vehicle road traffic collision -

The garden has been created by staff and contractors from housebuilders Barratt Homes and David Wilson Homes.The custom design incorporates traditional elements of earth, wind, fire and air, and has been purpose-built for the school.Ysgol Y Deri supports a erse range of pupils with specialist needs from ages three to .Rhys Jones said: ldquoItrsquos absolutely phenomenal. Having this facility for all ages and abilities is something that I wish I had when I was younger.ldquoIrsquove been asked to open the garden and Irsquom honoured to be at the school. Irsquove read up a little about it and what theyrsquore doing is outstanding.Caroline Williams, headteacher of primary at Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoThe dedication and hard work of all the volunteers was incredible under dficult conditions, with lots of clay and concrete to dig through. The space was sad and neglected before and now is interesting, welcoming and inviting truly a space for all our learners to explore their senses. The pupils loved exploring it for the first time on Saturday during the official opening.ldquoWe canrsquot thank the teams enough who have brought this project together Barratt David Homes and their volunteers for the financial support and labour, Dunn Landscapes who managed the work daily, Pam Creed for her design and Pughrsquos Garden centre for the donation of the plants, as well as KidsOut for the donation of the musical instruments.Barratt Homes and David Wilson Homes managing director Steve Williams said: ldquoEveryone at Barratt gets a day off to volunteer for a charity. So we looked for a project that we could all do together to really make a dference. From the company  people volunteered to work on the project. Itrsquos fair to say we all got a lot out of it. It really warms our hearts to see what wersquove been able to do in four weeks.Blisse Mellons, , and her mother Laura were already using the gardens. ldquoShe likes this one a lot.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people.

Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

focused  ","story":"A family have spoken of their pride after their son defied the odds to graduate from Ulster University#s Magee campus.Joel Emerson, who was diagnosed with autism at the age of three, graduated with a . in Business Information Systems on July .The -year-old attended Ceara School in Lurgan for two years before transferring to Richmount Primary on the Moy Road and then to Donacloney Primary to finish his primary education.Praising the educators who supported her son in his early years, Joel’s mother Rhonda said: “When Joel started Ceara, he didn’t have many communication skills. After his two years there his communication skills had improved and he was able to move into mainstream education. He’d been introduced to the schedule system and this helped immensely.“Joel received support from a classroom assistant at Richmount and also when he moved to Donacloney. Joel then moved to Dromore High. He worked hard in his GCSEs and A levels and was able to go on to study at Magee. We’re very proud of what he has achieved.”Although Joel’s graduation was a chance to celebrate his educational successes, it was also an emotional day for the family. Rhonda added: “My mother Margaret Boyd passed away before Joel’s graduation. She had bought Joel’s laptop that he used at Magee and had been very supportive during his educational journey.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/NI-Chamber-President.jpg","title":"ni politicians must not waste time amid restoration talks","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s politicians “must not waste time” amid ongoing talks at restoring an Executive while business here should employ the “collaborative vision” that saw industries grow following the Good Friday Agreement.

That’s a welcome step forward. But after two years without movement of any kind, we shouldn’t expect results in a hurry.” Speaking about the Chamber’s attempt to host the World Chambers Congress, he said: “Less than two weeks ago, NI Chamber along with the British Chamber of Commerce and Chambers Ireland were in Rio at the World Chambers Congress, showcasing Northern Ireland as a potential host for the conference in . “Held every two years in a dferent region of the world, the World Chambers Congress provides unparalleled opportunities to connect and strengthen relations with a erse and international group of iniduals representing more than  countries. “The bid,successful, could bring an estimated economic value of £.m to Northern Ireland and we were joined in Rio by our strategic partners including Invest Northern Ireland, Belfast City Council, Visit Belfast and ICC Belfast.” Those attending the lunch also heard from Eddie O’Sullivan, former head coach to the Irish national rugby team, and gaelic football legend Pat Spillane.
