He has instead expressed concerns about the \u0027waste and inefficiency\u0027 in huge defence procurement programmes.He\u0027s completely right, of course. The Ministry of Defence needs a total shake-up. Its record on large projects is appalling. Billions might be saved. Even if they are, though, that won\u0027t be enough to give the armed forces the extra resources they need.Maybe I\u0027m being over suspicious, but I fear there\u0027s limited appetite to increase defence spending above the relatively modest commitment already made to raise it by 0.5 per cent every year above the rate of inflation during this Parliament.The fact remains that the best way for Britain to be respected by its allies and potential enemies in a post-Brexit world is for it to have formidable armed forces. Global Britain partly involves being able to project global power.Let me cite the example of Russia. Its GDP is barely 60 per cent of the UK\u0027s. But it packs a much greater punch in the world, largely because it devotes a greater proportion of its resources to defence.Needless to say, I\u0027m not suggesting Mr Johnson adopts an aggressive foreign policy such as Russia\u0027s.

Lots of towns and villages host winter festivals and parades one of the biggest is the Festivalul de Datini și Obiceiuri Strămoșești (the festival of customs and ancestors’ customs) in Comănești on 30 December. Different groups come from miles around to participate, and it has become best known for its bear dancers: groups who process through the streets in bear costumes, often made from real animal furs, some as much as 50 years old.The bear was a sacred animal in ancient Romania. It’s thought that the tradition of dancing bears originated many centuries ago among the Roma who would visit villages just before New Year with real bears on leashes to dance and chase away bad spirits from the outgoing year. When the country was under communist rule, it was banned bear dancing was made illegal in 1998 and, when Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU in 2007, the last of the dancing bears were bought from their owners and “retired” to a bear reserve in the Rila mountains.As well as the “bears” in Comănești’s festival, each group will also have someone playing the “Gypsy” andor “The Bear Tamer”, plus musicians with drums and panpipes. Everyone dances and sings as they go through the streets, making their way to a stage where they act out a simple ritual scene in which the bear collapses because a demon is inside him. The Gypsy comes with a knife and bleeds the bear, lets the demon out and the bear revives. It’s a story of rebirth for the new year. In some versions of the tradition, the bear, the Gypsy and the drummers also go from house to house in the village, singing and dancing to ward off evil and bring good luck.I didn’t go to the festival as a child. Photography has helped me discover my country in a fuller way. I live in the UK now but have been to Comănești and the region five times over the past decade to photograph the festivals. This shot was from 2013. It’s mostly men and boys who dress up in the bear skins, but I have seen girls, too. The boy is wearing a real bear skin that would have been very old and very heavy – some of them weigh up to 50kg - and also very hot.It’s really hard to shoot a procession. You can either sprint ahead and wait for the group, or walk backwards in front of them. I prefer that way, but you can’t then see where you’re going and I’m always praying I’m not going to step on something or trip.I’d spotted this boy earlier – sometimes the dancers take the masks off because they get too hot – and was struck by something about his expression. There are lots of photographers at the event, so the boy knew I was shooting him but didn’t take any notice of me. He was flushed because he’d been dancing and running all day, and there was this one moment when he was looking in my direction. I didn’t realise at the time I’d got such a good shot.When I photograph, I’m always so immersed in what I’m doing that I don’t stop to consider what I’ve taken. I just try to get as many shots as possible – if you stop you risk missing things. You never know what’s round the corner. When I look at the photo now, the only thing I regret is the lack of snow. There’s usually snow on the ground at the time, but climate change is affecting Romania’s weather like everywhere else, and the snow often comes in March rather than DecemberJanuary.This picture has changed my life. It won a National Geographic Traveller UK competition. Part of my prize was a trip to the Maasai Mara, where I’d always dreamed of going. It has brought me international recognition and commissions, and has also helped make the festival famous all over the world. It’s even live on Facebook these days. I heard about someone coming from Japan to see it. Last year, I met the mayor of Comănești, and to my amazement he gave me a big hug!I’m fascinated by traditions and costumes. In a costume you can be something other than yourself. In recent visits to the region’s winter festivals, I’ve also focused on a portraiture series, asking people in their colourful costumes to pose for me in front of a mobile studio. I came across one bear costume made entirely of reeds that weighed 100kg. Other costumes (there can be horses, deer and goats as well as bears) are made of rags or paper, while some people paint their faces or wear really elaborate masks or pointed hats that are a metre high.Many Romanians who work abroad return each year specifically to take part in the winter festivals – it’s how they express and celebrate their cultural identity. There’s always an amazing vibe in Comănești. I dance, too – you feel so much energy. Whenever I photograph, whatever my subject, I try to bring a good energy to it, but here it was easy.• See more images at Alecsandra Raluca Drăgoi’s website.Trained: BA in photography, Portsmouth University MA in documentary photography and photojournalism, Westminster University.High point: “Winning the Sony awards’ youth category in 2013 and National Geographic Traveller UK in 2015.

The friend who had taken me to mass in the first place suggested I speak to his favourite priest.By now Father Ben was an old man and semi-retired. He smiled at me as I sat down and stammered out my story, showed him my Dummies book and told him I was learning about the sacraments. Eventually I ran out of steam and stopped blathering. What he said next will stay with me for ever. I can boil it down to three key points, using more or less his exact words.Lastly, I have always liked going into bookshops. When I was a young man, the mind, body and spirit section was tiny. But now it’s a whole wall in some shops. That’s what it’s all about – we all want the same thing. But forget about the books, the church and everything else for that matter. Just be still: all you have to do is be still and the truth will come to you. That’s all there is to it.And that was me. A few months later, at Easter, I became a Catholic. I’ve spoken to countless Catholics since. Be they devout, furiously against the church or merely lapsed, there is invariably, for better or for worse, a good or bad priest at the heart of their stories. Father Benignus O’Rourke was my good priest. I write this now because he died last year and to my lasting regret, I never thanked him properly. During that chat in 2007 he made me promise I would be still for a little while every day from that day onwards. I was always too ashamed to confess to him that I only managed this about four times. I’m trying to rectify that this year in his memory. I hope he’s resting in peace. I strongly suspect he is.

Following Wurtzel’s death on Tuesday, an author tweeted: “Elizabeth Wurtzel was a major factor in making personal essay the currency of women writers in the 90s. This was a blessing and a curse, both for her and for the rest of us.”Of course, the begrudgery and the ambivalence – as well as all the criticism Wurtzel received – is only one side of the story. For many people Prozac Nation, her debut about depression, was an exhilarating break from literary convention, an entirely new and liberating way to write and conceive of oneself as a writer. Wurtzel’s enormous success helped to popularise a particular raw, candid memoir style that in turn would influence the boom in online personal essays – what Slate magazine once termed “the first person industrial complex”, hordes of mostly women writers getting their early breaks by writing intimate pieces.The culture changed, helped not only by Wurtzel and her contemporaries but by the incontinent nature of online writing: in the 26 years since the publication of Prozac Nation, female “confessional” writing has gone from a non-genre, to utterly pervasive, to played out and haggard. Editors began to stress that they did not want to hear personal pitches. It has become a bit of a trope among established writers to warn younger ones off this kind of work, largely for good reason. And yet I bristle when they do.Once, and not very long ago, such warnings were born of censoriousness, not kindness. Many laughed at Wurtzel and her latter contemporaries for their candour and their self-obsession, finding there to be something essentially unseemly, un-literary about their work – and, I would venture, something inherently, stickily feminine. To be a woman accepted into the literary establishment, you had to be not only fastidiously intellectual – you had to become a figure beyond femaleness. If you had an exceptionally fine mind then you could sneak in, always reminded of your luck, but the realm of the mind was the only one you were allowed to exist within. The way you had sex, gave birth, went mad, were hurt – that was all a bit too close to the bone, too messy, too bloody.Now, once again, we warn young women to be cautious with the material of their lives, not to be careless with their disclosures. We do this because we know they can be manipulated by an uncaring economy that uses the desire to be published in exchange for trauma, trauma that is then consumed pruriently. I too feel revulsion at the crass editors and readers who abuse the trust and hope of young writers. And yet I worry that in trying to protect them, we are – if not intentionally, then in a material sense – veering back to enforcing the idea that their difficult experiences are lowbrow and beneath the remit of good writing.We should trust that not every young woman writer is a naive mark being hustled if they do choose to write about dark or private subjects. The first real thing I ever wrote, when I was 24, was about getting an abortion when abortion was still illegal in Ireland. I was paid about $40 (£30), which seemed a lot back then, and a (male) colleague commented beneath it, “You’ll regret writing this” – meaning, I think, that I would be embarrassed by it when I was older. I never did regret it, because it led, in part, to my establishing a career. Nor did I ever find that the embarrassment – which did exist, sure – outdid the pride I had in producing a good piece of writing.It strikes me as a bleak concession to the world of waged work to tell young women not to write about things they feel strongly about. Better, surely, to tell them to sack off the fifty quid from an exploitative editor, do a few shifts in a cafe instead and for the hell of it write freely, personally, about all the painful subjects they are inclined to when they get in at night.Writing can still be beautiful and incendiary and culturally worthy even if it isn’t personally a joy to publish or if it doesn’t somehow “heal” the person writing it. Not all of us are looking for catharsis or to be reconciled with the past, but are looking instead to make good, valuable creative work.Embarrassment is not a byproduct but an essential component of some kinds of memoir. You can relate an event or an emotion that makes you look stupid or vain or vulnerable or foolish, but there is nothing foolish about groundbreaking art. Maybe it will be messy. Maybe we will regret it at times. But that’s fine. The point of great personal writing is to show how things really are, how life really is. Life is messy and humiliating. Why shouldn’t art be too?• Megan Nolan is an Irish writer based in London.

While they have, understandably, railed against the left’s “no compromise with the electorate” tendency, they’ve failed to acknowledge that they cannot retake the Labour leadership without first winning over the membership.They lacked ideas, unable to realise that Corbynism emerged amid the intellectual exhaustion of all other wings of the Labour party. It triumphed because the old social democrats had abandoned consistent social democracy, and the only faction willing to still champion it was the party’s left flank. No answers have been offered as to why there is an international crisis of European social democracy, of which Britain is just one example. In other words, they became backward looking, defined by what they were against rather than what they were for, and politically incurious: traits they once characterised as defining their leftwing opponents.In the aftermath of Labour’s catastrophic defeat, these remain the tests for any leadership candidate seeking a decisive rupture with what came before. On the candidates’ side is the knowledge that the members are traumatised, and, despite their frequent demonisation as an extremist and dangerous rabble, they are largely non-ideological, sharing a general revulsion at injustices and a desire for sufficiently radical solutions to tackle them.Lisa Nandy’s advantages are that she resisted Labour’s shift towards a referendum, and that she is a woman and a solid media performer. And her fixation with towns is all the more important after the party’s devastating losses in the north and Midlands. But she too faces questions on her policy prospectus and on her passionate cry: “How dare we tell working-class people what’s good for them.” Listening after a devastating defeat is clearly crucial. But surely the point of politics is to offer a plan that will improve people’s lives – though, to be effective, it should be married to their lived experiences, and explained in a way that isn’t patronising or elitist.Jess Phillips’s campaign extols her background and promises a policy offer focusing on social care, childcare and the climate crisiswith a theme of priorities and “doing the right thing”. But with backers firmly on the Blairite wing, it would prove a decisive turnaround in the membership’s attitudes for them to accept an inevitable decisive shift to the right. Emily Thornberry’s sassy charisma and loyalty to Corbyn during the 2016 coup won her many admirers, and she was once Len McCluskey’s favoured successor. Today she faces the same questions as Starmer, and is unlikely to make the ballot. As is Clive Lewis, who won’t get the MPs and unions needed to pass the threshold. He is using the campaign to flag-wave for his passionate priorities: like a so-called progressive alliance, democratising the party and challenging what he sees as an intolerant machine politics. He deserves a bright political future.The left’s flagbearer, Rebecca Long Bailey, had a slow start for ironic reasons: her fear of being boxed in as “continuity Corbyn” made her reluctant to hire figures associated with the project, and there are few experienced leftwingers ready to serve who are not. And while her first  article read like it was written by committee, her tub-thumping launch piece in Tribune energised the left’s base. Bright and details-focused, a working-class woman from a leave community, her impressive first interview on the BBC’s Today programme was cheerful and full of willingness to accept Labour’s major errors: on Brexit, on antisemitism, on not having a coherent vision, not having the public’s trust, not rebutting a vicious media onslaught. But her pitch must go beyond being “Corbyn without the baggage” or a one-more-heave approach: her team needs a detailed, coherent strategy for why a compelling socialist vision can win in 2024 that decisively breaks with what came before. Some fear a return to the worst machine politics of the Corbyn era: to convince doubters, her team should emphasise a pluralistic, let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom style. Indeed, elements from the current leadership who are wedded to such machine politics tried to encourage Labour chair Ian Lavery to stand and are now promoting Barry Gardiner as a candidate, fearing they cannot control Long Bailey. It is entirely self-destructive.All candidates have pressing questions to answer, and they must be addressed to a membership desperate to end Tory rule while offering an unquestioningly inspiring alternative. A break with the past, yes, but a genuine one – not a return to the discredited compromise of 2015, or irrelevant nostalgia for 1997."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67fd00fbf19f4f4015b08e45ecf812ad50a59224/0_12_1147_688/master/1147.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d204c9c7addd78b0f2cd087d233dc8f8","title":"guys ask for more money why female led startups underperform","story":"Male culture and a lack of role models are stopping female academics from launching companies based on their researchThe first time Olivia Champion pitched a business idea based on her academic research was so disheartening she nearly gave up. The 10-strong panel she faced were all men, bar a few women responsible for administration and taking minutes. Their first question was: “Why are you here?”“It took the wind out of my sails immediately,” she says. “I thought, ‘Blimey. This is going badly.’”She had been convinced her idea was good, but after that rejection she began to doubt herself. “They were very dismissive,” she says. “And quite rude, to be frank.”After being encouraged by her university, Exeter, to give pitching one more try, Champion went on to secure all the investment she was seeking. Five years on, her company, BioSystems Technology, which sells insect larvae for scientific testing and reduces the need to experiment on mammals, is in profit.The research, part of a programme funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) looking at barriers to the participation of female scientists in university spinout companies, also found that women in decision-making positions were more likely to work in smaller spinouts – those with fewer than 25 employees – and that the more female founders a spinout company had, the less financial investment it tended to receive.Simonetta Manfredi, who is leading the research and is a professor of equality and ersity at Oxford Brookes, says this matters because university spinouts will soon become increasingly important, due to a government drive to force institutions to demonstrate the real-world impact of their research. “Spinouts produce jobs and can make a significant contribution to their local community,” she says.Politicians are also waking up to the importance of gender equality in this area. Last year, a government-commissioned review of female entrepreneurship found only one in three UK entrepreneurs were women, and argued that addressing this could boost the economy by £250bn,.But it is also about ensuring a more equal society Ana Avaliani, head of enterprise at the Royal Academy of Engineering, says: “The types of products women bring to tender are informed by their experience and knowledge so it is vital we encourage female entrepreneurs to bring that perspective.” But the picture is complex. There is much less disparity in the number of women studying physical sciences and more women than men studying biological sciences, yet female spinout representation here is still low.While spinouts are traditionally founded by academics in senior positions, Manfredi says there is no reason they cannot happen at other career stages. “The assumption that there are not enough female professors, so what can we do about it, is not true because there is a bigger pipeline there,” she says.Yet she concedes that the male culture in science can be a barrier, alongside a lack of female entrepreneur role models. Avaliani, who was part of the founding team of a startup company 20 years ago, says being the only female was intimidating.“There were about five men – all engineers, all super high-achievers - in the room for a team meeting, and just me,” she says. “Although I was never made to feel a lesser member of the team it felt weird.”While the founders of her startup were convinced of the benefits of ersity, she suggests this is not often the case and the pressure to make a profit can make managers unwilling to take hiring risks.The researchers are also investigating why female-led spinouts tend to receive less money. One suggestion is that it is because they ask for less. Champion says she was conscious that she was pitching for significantly less money than her male counterparts. “I stripped it all back to think, ‘What’s the absolute least I can ask for?’” she says.Time out of regular academic jobs to explore an idea would help potential female entrepreneurs, she adds. There is also evidence that women have less time for networking, which is an essential part of entrepreneurial success, so more opportunities for virtual networking could be useful.The next stage of the project, to be published in April, will look at whether men and women have different characteristics that may effect their involvement in spinouts, such as differences in self-confidence or willingness to take risks. If Champion could go back in time, she says she would tell herself to be more confident – and ask for more money. “The guys all ask for loads of money and get it,” she says.

Languages are vital for effective trade, diplomacy and soft power, for social cohesion, social mobility, and educational attainment, all of which will be essential to the UK’s future success,” said Neil Kenny, languages lead at the British Academy.Nick Hillman, Hepi’s director, said making foreign languages optional at GCSE was one of the worst education policy blunders in recent memory, and that reinstating them was a “no-brainer”.The report suggests that GCSEs in England be supplemented by less academic alternative qualifications, including one for vocational language use and another for the study of community languages, available up to the end of the sixth form.A symptom of the decline has been a shortage of teachers, with the report recommending that language teachers be added to the Home Office’s shortage occupation list, to help recruit teaching staff from overseas. Currently only Mandarin teachers are on the list.The report notes that the devolved school systems in Wales and Scotland have had more success in encouraging the study of languages than England’s, especially in primary schools."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d36ab2feebbdfa90e074679e1d3b99dfc41b8616/894_531_2513_1508/master/2513.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08baf09f6f2015c0e5bb09a1f6392f6e","title":"fashion top trend setter li edelkoort futurologist perfect clothes 2020s","story":"When Lidewij – or Li – Edelkoort started her career as a trend forecaster 45 years ago, people thought her job was “witchcraft”, she says. “Men would be giggling at the end of the room. But I have gained respect,” she says, “because I have been right so many times.”The Dutch 69-year-old is fashion’s best-known soothsayer, a woman who has spent more than four decades helping brands, including Prada, Zara and Coca-Cola, to anticipate customer desire. She is also the dean of hybrid design studies for the prestigious New York fashion college Parsons School of Design, a curator (one recent exhibition was an installation in Tokyo in which Google devices were placed among artisanal homeware), and a regular on “most influential people” lists in fashion and design.When we meet, she is swathed in loose, dark layers of Escada and Issey Miyake, and has just delivered a lecture to a rapt audience of 100 fashion and retail buyers in London. With striking hair (a dark bob with Lily Munster streaks) and thick black spectacles, she speaks slowly, in very long sentences: interviewing her can feel like consulting a very niche psychic. She is given to issuing prophecies such as: “I think we will get very inspired by blouses.”But while it is fun to imagine her as the Nostradamus of fast-moving consumer goods, her methods are relatively down to earth. Through research, interviews and travel, she picks up ideas that are “circling around”, then uses her “intuition” (“data is no use it’s too late,” she says wearily) to predict which of them will take off.She has never made a bad call, she says, not least because her predictions “are not my invention”. “I’m just picking it up and broadcasting it. It is not a creative profession. It is more analytic.” What she will admit to is occasionally miscalculating the “volume” of a trend. After seeing leggings on New York City messengers at the end of the 80s, for example, “I thought, that’s cool – it will be a trend. Little did I know it would become a billion-dollar business.”For at least 10 years, she says, trends have slowed down, becoming “vast currents which are mobilised over time”. This makes me feel a bit basic, when I then ask for assurances about whether the midi skirt I’m wearing will still be fashionable in 2025. “That idea left us somewhere in the 80s,” she says drily. “Everyone can have the length they desire.”Edelkoort has, in fact, gone further than this. In 2015, she predicted the death of the fashion industry as we know it, slamming it as “a ridiculous and pathetic parody” in a treatise titled the Anti_Fashion Manifesto. Last year, she wrote a similarly damning appraisal of the Met Gala, calling the red carpet a “mesmerising and sickening” display, which came on “the same day the UN published a scientific survey that certified that because of human greed, excess, waste and abuse of our habitat we will lose one million species”.She was so angry when she wrote that, she said, that “I didn’t even recognise myself,” yet these moments of truth-telling made her more popular. “When I made the manifesto, I could have lost all my clients – I took a risk. But the timing was right. People sent me messages saying: ‘This is what we all think!’” Anyway, Edelkoort says, you only have to look at the closures of blue-chip brands such as Barneys to see that people are sick of fashion as usual. “It is no longer attractive for people to encounter the same old thing on every street corner. The consumer doesn’t see the point any more,” she says. “Wake up, people!”After our interview, she presents a second lecture, the latest of her big predictions, titled The Future of Luxury. She argues that in the next decade – as people tire of overconsumption – our lives will shift radically. She urges the assembled fashion professionals to “make much less, make it better and make it more expensive”. She says that success will not be expressed in dollars but “in degrees of happiness”.“People are an endangered species and if you’re not part of the big change you’re not relevant,” she tells me afterwards. Many brands, she argues, will close if they don’t change. “It’s very hard to turn these big boats around,” she says. “It’s much easier to start a new company now than scale down.”Despite Boris Johnson’s recent election – and regardless of the presence of a climate-change denier in the Oval Office – she believes young people will continue to fight for a better future, and will get one. “Crazily enough, elections everywhere in the world go against it,” she says, but she believes the hunger for a greener, fairer, less consumerist society is growing and that eventually there will be a tipping point.“In Germany and parts of China, there is an increasing understanding that ecology equals economy. The day we are able to prove this, I think we will create change.” Witchcraft or otherwise, here’s hoping she is right.LibrariesLibraries will “start lending clothes, offering lectures and writing courses, hosting exhibitions and concerts”, says Edelkoort. She believes they will become “the epicentres of small towns and villages”, partly run by community volunteers in return for access. In Tokyo, she says, there are already “beautiful” libraries where people work and dine together. She believes this will be one of many “societal initiatives bringing us back together”, in response to today’s “dangerous” state of disconnection.Our eye for colour will change as natural dyes – such as those made from onions and avocados – become mainstream. Their colours are less saturated, “more subdued and melancholic”. Similarly, more sustainable fabrics, such as those made from nettle and algae, will become popular.‘Non-fashion’ fashionEdelkoort believes “proven, functional” workwear shapes will be popular in the 2020s. “We will retreat, after all this newness, possibly into something more sensible and pragmatic,” she says.There will still be “a need for romantic dresses – slightly high-waisted a need for volume.” Edelkoort cites the Irish designer Simone Rocha as someone who is “now getting major acclaim”. That silhouette is, she says, “beguiling” and encourages “a more dancing step”.Flight shamingIn the next decade, we will fly a tenth as much as we do today, says Edelkoort. In Scandinavian countries, she says, wealthy people are already selling their houses abroad rather than face their friends’ disapproval at their regular flying. Recently, KLM advised customers to fly less. Train travel, she believes, will take off instead. She argues that this will happen because “the big innovative companies, like Google, Tesla and Apple” will invest in green technology, while some companies will rethink their business plans in a radical way. KLM and British Airways, for example, “would be smart” to invest in the rail sector to make up for the shortfall in domestic flights.An age of collaborationIn fashion and design, “there will be co-creation. One of my visions of the future is that it will be the age of the amateur people will be empowered to be more creative.”The end of ‘stuffocation’Edelkoort cites the popularity of shows on Netflix about decluttering as a sign that citizens will soon buy into the “revelation” that having less stuff will make us happier. She believes that people will grow to cherish their selected possessions so deeply that we will eventually see the rise of animism, where objects are respected, treated “like pets”. “This is a bit further in time,” she says, “but it will definitely happen.”• This article was corrected on 8 January 2020.

They have their own makeup line designed around what they assume women want: to wear “cherry-poppin’” lip gloss, to cover up their flaws, to look hot for men. The makeup dudes are supposed to be a joke – a ridiculous contrast to the earnest empowerment of Mel and Mia’s line, which assumes women beautify for themselves – but I couldn’t help feeling like the bit encapsulates the film, directed by Miguel Arteta, as a whole. It’s a movie starring women and marketed to women as a girls night out romp that mistakes the surface-level mention of sex or bodily functions or raunch for something real, or humorous, or what women want.It’s also written by two men. Based on a story by veteran TV writer Danielle Sanchez-Witzel, the script by Adam Cole-Kelly and Sam Pitman flattens the shadow of ribald and genuinely hilarious female-driven movies like Bridesmaids into material as thin as filo dough. That material is, basically, the assumption that women talking about sex  vaginas  penises in various slang is automatically comedic. (See: the first lines from the trailer – “why is dream sex so much better than real sex?” asks Mia. “Because they come when you want them to,” answers Mel, which is … an observation, though not a particularly funny one).Claire Luna, a cartoonish capitalist in 7in heels, has visions for the duo which do not include wholesome self-empowerment, and hinges her majority ownership on the breakup of Mel and Mia’s partnership. They promise it’s impossible to break them up. Between that promise and the trailer, you’ve basically seen the movie. There’s shoe-throwing, exposition-laden heart-to-hearts, and more breaking things, interspersed with clunky references to how much time has passed and the fact that Mia is black and Mel is not. Nothing in the script is remotely surprising or very funny, though nothing is horrendous, either.Which is a shame, because the performances here deserve better. All three stars are admirably game and unafraid of reaching for camp, physical contortions or bad karaoke. Haddish is, at her best, a magnetic live wire, while Byrne (also a Bridesmaids veteran – sense a theme?) demonstrates once again that she can do awkward dancing-with-the-kids better than most. Supporting stars Billy Porter and Jennifer Coolidge make the most of flimsy lines and one-note characters. The high star wattage makes Like a Boss watchable, in a seeing a four-minute miler running alone on a track kind of way: the talent is clear and compelling, but devoid of surroundings on its level, hard to appreciate. It is definitely the kind of movie I’d watch through the seats of the person in front of me chose it on a flight.But it could be more than that, as there are kernels of something interesting here: an interracial best friendship and business partnership in today’s America, or navigating best friendship on the cusp of middle age, or maintaining the ethics of your business and passion under the growth mandate of capitalism. It would take thought, and jokes constructed with a motivation other than how to include the word coochie. It would take an understanding that women want to see sex and their bodies talked about filthily on screen, but are smart enough to know that’s not always enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4108b5d96c11ed2852e385b4e5bc52bedaed992b/0_89_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fd03ac02f3e9db9d8d8d64b762b93b3","title":"oscars 2020 no host abc","story":"ABC has confirmed that the Academy awards will be without a traditional host after execs were ‘extremely happy’ with last year’s telecastThis year’s Oscars ceremony will be without a traditional host for the second year running, according to the ABC entertainment president, Karey Burke.Given the lack of official announcement with just weeks to go, industry experts had already predicted the decision but Burke has now officially confirmed a lack of host at the Television Critics Association’s winter press tour.“We expect that we’re going to have a very commercial set of nominations and a lot of incredible elements have come together that make us think we are going to have a very entertaining show again,” she said.Burke also teased that this year’s telecast would boast “huge entertainment values, big musical numbers, comedy and star power”.Last year’s original host, Kevin Hart, stepped down after online anger over a resurfaced past of homophobic jokes and tweets.

The FA does not sell the rights to these companies directly it has sold global betting rights on the FA Cup to the marketing company IMG for a reported $4m (£3.1m) a year and IMG sells the packages on. In addition to the seven companies that have bought the rights to show the matches in the UK, IMG has sold similar streaming rights to other betting sites internationally the company declined to provide a list of those companies.Although the deals have been running since the start of last season, the FA is facing particular criticism now because it used the third-round matches last weekend as an opportunity to promote its “take a minute” campaign to improve mental health.The FA emphasised that the media deals were concluded, via IMG, before the decision was taken to sever sponsorships with betting companies. The governing body has said it will review the sale of betting rights to FA Cup matches before the rights deals are renewed for the 2024-25 season.“The FA agreed a media rights deal with IMG in early 2017, part of which permits them to sell the right to show live footage or clips of FA Cup matches to bookmakers,” an FA spokesman said. “This deal was agreed before we made a clear decision on the FA’s relationship with gambling companies in June 2017 when we ended our partnership with Ladbrokes.“We will review this element of the media rights sales process ahead of tendering rights to the new cycle from the 2024-25 season onwards. Leagues and clubs continue to govern their own relationships with gambling companies.”When the FA ended its official betting partnership with Ladbrokes and all sponsorships with betting companies in May 2017, it said it followed a three-month review of its approach as football’s governing body “taking betting sponsorship, whilst being responsible for the regulation of sports betting within the sport’s rules”.A month earlier, Joey Barton, then playing for Burnley, had been given an 18-month ban by the FA for breaching the prohibition on players gambling. Barton then stated that he had a gambling addiction and pointed to betting companies’ increasingly heavy involvement in sponsorship and other associations with football, including the FA’s high-profile partnership with Ladbrokes.IMG packages rights for betting companies with live streaming through its IMG Arena operation, which says on its website: “We specialise in bringing sport and the sports betting industry closer together via our federation services and world-class sports content.”Sports included in the IMG Arena betting deals include football, tennis, golf, basketball and T20 cricket, with “more than 22,800 events, which are served to more than 100 operators worldwide”.Dr Darragh McGee of the University of Bath, who has conducted extensive research on the consequences for some men’s mental and financial health of excessive gambling on football, said this sale of FA Cup broadcasting rights was “an alarming new dimension in the ‘gamblification’ of football, which is already saturated with targeted advertising campaigns, sponsorship of high-profile clubs, and naming rights to stadia and supporter events.“In effect, it means that Bet365 and other betting companies can become primary gatekeepers for public access to live sporting coverage. This further incentivises gambling participation among fans, including young people in vulnerable situations and groups.“At a time when the harms associated with online sports gambling are increasingly transparent, the FA’s decision to prioritise corporate gain over the protection of public health and sporting integrity demonstrates a lack of moral leadership.”Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative party leader who co‑chairs a cross-party group of MPs on gambling reform, said the deal was unethical: “I intend to ask the government to look carefully at any funding we’re giving the FA … The idea that you hand to a betting company the ability to use the incentive of watching football games, linked to membership, runs counter to the FA’s own statements with regard to reducing their reliance on betting.“It’s no excuse that this happened before they took that step. They should have reviewed it and cancelled it.”Nicky Morgan, culture, media and sport secretary, tweeted that she hoped the FA would reconsider the arrangement.Bet365 stressed that its commercial arrangement was through IMG, not directly with the FA, and that nobody has to bet on an FA Cup match to watch the stream. The company said requiring people to have placed a bet in the previous 24 hours, or to have a funded account “importantly ensures that all such customers are fully verified to prevent under-18s from accessing the service.“Bet365 believes that these streaming services provide added value to its customers and enable them to watch FA Cup matches that they might not otherwise have been able to see.”Betfair said the FA Cup matches on its site were available to people signed up to an account with money in it and it was not necessary to place a bet in order to watch matches.GamCare (gamcare.org.uk, helpline: 0808 8020 133) offers free information, support and counselling for problem gamblers in the UK"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d80cba42f0028b64b7007f67104e7305ede563d/0_303_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a32d848ea2e5b3594ad2777d84ab02d","title":"it takes a thick skin to rock a bald head meet the women embracing hair loss","story":"Society often associates femininity with long, flowing locks – but a growing number of women are choosing to celebrate their baldnessBarbara Williams didn’t get married just to change her name – of course not. But the opportunity to have a new surname was certainly an attractive proposition. Williams has had trichotillomania, a condition that causes her to pull out her hair compulsively, since she was nine – and her original name was Balde. Well, it wasn’t ideal.A 63-year-old picture framer from Warwickshire, Williams believes that her trichotillomania was triggered by the stress of her mother leaving the family home. She would lie awake at night and tug out great handfuls of hair, before rolling it up into a ball and hiding it behind the bed. By her 30s, she was totally bald. “It was just awful,” she sighs. “I couldn’t even watch shampoo adverts on the television. There would be a horrible feeling in my chest.”She wore wigs, but found them hot and uncomfortable. Then, when she turned 50, Williams decided: enough. She would be open with people about her condition and they could take her as they found her. “I felt dirty and like I would be rejected,” she says. “In fact, when I started telling people, it was a fantastic relief, like a great weight had been taken off my shoulders.”Williams is far from the only woman to embrace her baldness. The US talkshow host Ricki Lake recently went public with her 30-year struggle with hair loss, explaining that her hair started falling out when she appeared in the 1988 film Hairspray. “There have been a few times where I have even felt suicidal over it,” she wrote in a heartfelt Facebook post. “Almost no one in my life knew the level of deep pain and trauma I was experiencing.” Lake wore hair extensions, but the process of having them fitted was expensive, time-consuming and painful. She has decided to stop wearing extensions or wigs. “I am so done with hiding,” Lake wrote.Other celebrities have spoken out about female hair loss. The British TV presenter and 90s lads’ mags regular Gail Porter was diagnosed with alopecia in her 30s and has talked about her experience openly. After winning gold at the London Olympics in 2012, the cyclist Joanna Rowsell Shand, who also has alopecia, appeared on the podium jubilant and bald.Lake, Porter and Rowsell Shand are high-profile advocates for the growing number of women choosing to accept their baldness, rather than hiding or disguising it. “Wigs have been a massive hindrance,” says Alice Austin, a 32-year-old social worker from Nottingham. She started losing her hair due to alopecia when she was in primary school. By nine, Austin’s hair had fallen out so much that she started wearing wigs to school. “They were these horrendously thick NHS wigs,” she remembers. “The kids would call me ‘Wiggy’.”In secondary school, a boy pulled off Austin’s wig as she was walking up a flight of stairs. When Austin played netball, students would chant “Wiggy wiggy wiggy”. “It was traumatic for me, because how you look is so important when you’re a teenager,” she says. “It massively knocked my confidence.” She says wearing a wig is not fun: your scalp itches, sudden bursts of wind induce terror – and you can forget about swimming in the sea on holiday.Motherhood changed things for Austin. “I turned 30 and thought: I have to get a grip on myself,” Austin says. “I’m a mum. Kids are so perceptive.” She stopped wearing her wig as often, deciding to play netball without it, or to do the school run bald. In summer, when the weather is warm, Austin hardly ever wears her wig. “I could never have done that before,” she says. Last year, for the first time, she didn’t renew her NHS wig prescription.Female hair loss can happen for a variety of reasons. “The most common reason is a disturbance in the hair cycle,” says Dr David Fenton, a London-based dermatologist and spokesman for the British Association of Dermatologists. “More follicles enter the resting phase as a reaction to something that’s happened in your life, whether it’s fever, weight loss, illness, stress or thyroid dysfunction.” This condition is called telogen effluvium. “As long as you can identify the reason for telogen effluvium, it usually grows back,” says Fenton. “Occasionally, it will precipitate the female equivalent of genetic hair loss, which will require long-term therapy to prevent you losing more hair.”Women can also experience hair loss due to hormone changes after the menopause, or if they have polycystic ovarian syndrome. In this instance, doctors may prescribe antiandrogen contraceptives, which block the excessive production of male sex hormones in the body, which is known to cause hair loss. Alopecia occurs when the body’s immune system goes into overdrive and begins targeting hair follicles in error.Black women who wear braids may also experience traction alopecia, which is hair loss caused by very tight hairstyles. Doctors can help minimise hair loss – minoxidil solution, sold commercially as Regaine lotion, is an effective over-the-counter solution for alopecia – but they can’t prevent alopecia attacks coming on. “Alopecia can be very upsetting, because it happens so suddenly,” says Fenton. “One week you have hair, then in a few weeks you can be bald. Attacks may flare up suddenly. Every time it happens, the person grieves.”Hair loss is particularly devastating for women, as femininity in western cultures is typically associated with long, flowing hair. “You can’t overestimate the social, emotional and psychological effects of hair loss on a woman, particularly if that person’s hair has been a major feature of their appearance,” says Fenton.Christala Fletcher, who is 27 and from west London, has alopecia. She decided to shave her head when she was 19, after experiencing near-total hair loss. “It’s a mess, being a bald woman in our society,” she says. “People judge women without hair. Hair is so important in the media. It’s supposedly what makes you a woman.”Accepting your baldness in a society that connotes hair with femininity is cathartic. “Before, I felt like the wig dictated to me, as if I had to wear it whether I wanted to or not,” says Austin. “Now, I feel like I have a choice. I’d been stripped of that for so long.” But it may take years – and loving support – to get to a place where you are comfortable going bald in public. Many women find that online communities can be an important source of affirmation: Alopecia UK has a popular Facebook group, while there are forums for people with trichotillomania, too.The decision to shave what is left of your hair can feel momentous. “It was really tough,” says Fletcher of her decision to shave her head. Her sister helped her get through it. “She got the razor and said: ‘Let’s do this together.’ I had this patch of hair on the top of my head that I’d been holding on to so deeply.”But going out in public bald is often an anticlimax. “It was less scary than I thought,” says Juliet Fitzpatrick, a 55-year-old admin worker from Hertfordshire. After being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016, Fitzpatrick’s hair fell out due to chemotherapy. She decided to eschew wigs or headwraps. “For me, wearing a wig didn’t feel right. It felt like a pretence, like I was covering something up.”When her children graduated from university, Fitzpatrick asked them if they wanted her to wear a wig. They said no. “I said: ‘That’s good, because I don’t want to wear one!’” Going bald felt empowering. “I needed something positive to come out of this horrible experience for me, it was not wearing a wig and just being who I was at that particular point in my life.”Most of the time, going wig-free in public is a positive experience. “People are much kinder than you think,” says Austin. “When you’ve been bullied as a child, you think all people are nasty, mean and horrible, but people are much more understanding than you realise.” That said, well-intentioned strangers tend to assume that, if you are bald, you have cancer. “I always felt that people felt sorry for me because they thought I had cancer,” says Williams. “I was getting sympathy I didn’t deserve.”But not everyone is understanding. “It takes a person with thick skin to rock a bald head proudly,” Fletcher says. And there are situations in which being a bald woman can be stressful. Williams hates going to public toilets, because she worries that she will be mistaken for a man. “I’ll come out of a cubicle and women will do a double-take, or women walk into the bathroom and they’re not sure if they’ve accidentally walked into the gents.”Recently, Austin was on holiday in Cyprus for a friend’s wedding. “It was the first time I’d really embraced the alopecia,” she says. “I was walking around the pool without a headscarf on, and this mother of a little girl came up to me and burst into tears. She told me that her daughter had started losing her hair the year before and she didn’t know what to do.”Austin hopes for a relaxing of traditional beauty standards, so that by the time that girl has grown up being bald won’t be so unusual. “I think we’re seeing more people in the public eye who are different,” Austin says. “Our definitions of what is beautiful are changing. Women can be beautiful without hair.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7018b003fe18ea3024367141c8d5bf7b2733cd98/39_171_3450_2069/master/3450.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d274daf98869a102dbad75d28d41c81","title":"counting beans why 2020 should be the year of the legume","story":"Delicious, cheap, healthy and sustainable, legumes are a versatile staple – so why aren’t we eating more of them?From fagioli-eating peasants to lentil-loving hippies, legumes have quietly endured – in fact, they’ve been around since before 6000 BCE, filling the plates and bellies of people from cultures as erse as Greece, Italy, Morocco, Lebanon, Ethiopia, Egypt, Mexico and India.Yet legumes have often been maligned as bland food for vegans and the down at heel – a cliche that does a disservice to both people and plants. Less than one in three Australians eat them regularly. Some people aren’t even sure what they are, let alone how to cook them. Whether it be for health, the environment, animal ethics or simply tapping into their erse potential for simple, scrumptious meals, the time has come to shake some more cobwebs off the humble beans and restore them to their rightful glory.They were so precious to my late Italian mother-in-law that she smuggled dried cannellini beans into Australia in her bra when she migrated to join her husband here in the 1940s. Combined with generous dollops of velvety extra virgin olive oil, hand-crushed from their own trees, and homegrown “scarola” (ene), the beans were transformed into a simple yet exquisitely creamy dish that remains one of my husband’s favourites to this day.Cannellini beans comprise one of nearly 20,000 different species of legume. The hardy crops grow everywhere except Antarctica, from deserts to plains to the alps. Coming in a vast array of shapes and colours, they sprout as shrubs, vines and even trees. The one thing common to these plants is the fruit they grow in pods that can be split open to reveal the seeds. Edible versions are enjoyed fresh, dried, fermented and processed. Some well-known examples are broad beans, lentils, kidney beans, chickpeas, soya beans and lima beans. More bizarre varietals include jack, winged, tongue of fire, rattlesnake, sword and velvet beans.These little gems are brimming with nutritional goodness, including antioxidant polyphenols and essential nutrients such as B vitamins, iron, zinc, calcium and magnesium. Being high in fibre, legumes have a low glycemic index, which helps keep blood sugar levels under control, and they feed the hard-working microbes that keep our gut healthy. They are also a quality source of plant protein, especially when combined with wholegrains.This is good news for people seeking healthier meat alternatives that are also gentle on the planet. Legumes have some unique qualities that make them a no-brainer for sustainable agriculture. Growing them can release five to seven times fewer greenhouse gases than wheat and oilseed rape crops and they help sequester carbon in the soil. Legumes also have a nifty talent of imbuing the soil with nitrogen, in collaboration with microscopic friends that live in their roots. This makes them the perfect plant for intercropping and crop rotation, to enrich the soil and reduce the need for environmentally damaging fertilisers.Australians have access to a medley of cuisines from which to draw inspiration for legume dishes. Red kidney and borlotti beans, for example, just need a generous dose of paprika, sautéed with garlic, onion and chilli to make a base for nachos, tacos and burritos. A Lebanese feast invariably includes the traditional falafels and hummus, while a Moroccan twist can transform chickpeas into something else altogether. Indian dahls, made from an assortment of different lentils, beans and spices, are good comfort foods – simple recipes abound, or you can get more creative.On that note, Yotam Ottolenghi has risen to the challenge with his unique take on bean mash and vegetarian kubbeh spicy cannellini bean, leak and eggs (pictured above) or mouth-watering lentil recipes. If you fancy some butter beans, Rose Elliot has four recipes to choose from, depending on whether you feel like curry, soup, dip or warm roast vegetable salad. Lentils can provide a satisfying, savoury alternative for meat pies, and they can be moulded into burgers for summer barbecues or hamburgers. Baked beans are always popular, either from a tin, or as a gourmet excursion in themselves.If you don’t feel like going to much effort, a tin of cannellini beans is also a surprisingly morish side dish, cooked up in two minutes flat with some extra virgin olive oil, garlic and salt. It may not rival my mother-in-law’s nonna magic, but it’s sure to please.Natalie Parletta is a freelance science writer based in Australia.

He was scathing about some royal correspondents who covered the couple’s tour of South Africa in a furious statement he issued in October in which he said the “positive coverage” of the tour only exposed the “double standards of this specific press pack” who had also vilified his wife almost daily for nine months.The Sussexes said on their website: “Britain’s royal correspondents are regarded internationally as credible sources of both the work of members of The Royal Family as well as of their private lives. This misconception propels coverage that is often carried by other outlets around the world, amplifying frequent misreporting.“Regrettably, stories that may have been filed accurately by royal correspondents are, also, often edited or rewritten by media editorial teams to present false impressions.”In addition, the couple wants to bypass the rota when issuing photographs to ensure publications do not profit from the images. Historically, they said, they would be expected to release an image to the royal rota – “of which four of the seven are UK tabloids” – either simultaneously or in advance of releasing it in their on social media platforms. “This formula enables those select publications to profit by publishing these images on their websitesfront pages.”Now the couple intends to engage with “grassroots” media organisations and “young, up-and-coming journalists”, to invite specialist media to specific events and to provide access to “credible media outlets focused on objective news reporting to cover key moments and events”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ccfaf760ec878247a3af49c97fd61a9792e68d8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87477c5c73f628d3939dddf990d80a03","title":"tell us about outstanding customer service you received","story":"We want to hear from people who have received exceptional customer serviceAfter the Christmas spending flurry come the tales of corporate ill will, with botched delivery dates, faulty goods and customer service departments who don’t seem to listen or care.At this time of year, ’s consumer inboxes are congested with high street horror stories.Invisible in the background, some firms are going beyond the call of duty to fulfil orders and resolve issues.Often independent companies and occasionally big chains, handle complaints with care and respect, creating a better impression of themselves in the minds of their customers.We want to hear from people who have been bowled over by exceptional service, to show that corporate Britain can sometimes get it right.Has a trader driven through the night to ensure your goods reach you in time or soothed a situation with imaginative aplomb?Tell us about your experiences in the form below – one of our journalists may be in touch to discuss further and we’ll publish a selection as part of an upcoming feature.If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.

Now, the creators are shining new light on survivors’ storiesLast year, Surviving R Kelly spotlighted multiple women who shared allegations of sexual violence and abuse committed by Kelly. The show sparked a heated public reaction to the singer as boycotts of his music began his concerts were cancelled and the hashtag #MuteRKelly gained steam. Since Surviving R Kelly first aired in January 2019, more than two dozen sex-crime charges have been filed against Kelly. The pressure culminated in a volatile interview between Kelly and Gayle King in March 2019, Kelly shouting in tears: “I didn’t do this stuff! I’m fighting for my fucking life! Y’all killing me with this shit!”At first, the team behind the documentary was completely against doing a second season. What changed their minds? Seeing the harassment the profiled survivors faced after the documentary aired. (In one scene, Faith Rodgers, 21, recounts how friends of Kelly threatened to release nude photos and videos of her.) Another factor? Watching law enforcement officials continually fail to protect survivors of Kelly’s sexual violence and pursue the justice they deserve.Here, the executive producers Miranda Bryant and Jesse Daniels talk to the  about exploring who is responsible for protecting Kelly’s survivors, inserting women of color into the #MeToo movement, and the slim possibility of a third season.The first season of Surviving R Kelly worked diligently to make audiences care about Kelly’s survivors and issue a call to action.  What was the motivating force for this season?Jesse Daniels: “Those are not our girls” became a mission statement for us. We asked ourselves, “OK, well, whose responsibility are they? And whose responsibility is it to tell these stories?” We also started getting more messages from people who had worked for R Kelly and new survivors started coming forward. There was a rollout of charges against R Kelly and news outlets continued to report the story. We felt we were done, and then all of this started happening and we felt a new sense of responsibility to continue the story.What was it like to watch R Kelly’s public reactions to the boycotts and court cases? I’m thinking especially about his interview with Gayle King. Did it play a role in filming this second season?It was interesting to see how Surviving R Kelly particularly resonated with the black community. Were you conscious of the conversations and reactions occurring within black spaces around R Kelly and sexual violence?Bryant: The #MeToo movement hit and then the #TimesUp movement came around, and I think without the hard work of laying those things down, we wouldn’t have been where we were with Surviving R Kelly. I don’t think anyone would have been ready to hear from the survivors. For Lifetime, it’s important for them to be a platform for all women. In particular, as those two movements have been emerging on a broader level, it only looked like one thing. What was nice about Surviving R Kelly is that it gave a more inclusive perspective on what’s been happening in the world of sexual of violence with women. It was nice to fill in the gap.Do you think the documentary worked to lessen the victim-blaming these women face in any way?Daniels: If you were blaming a survivor, we wanted to peel that back and explain why you shouldn’t blame any survivor. If it was the parents, we wanted to present their perspective. A lot of people pointed to the music industry, so we wanted to pull the curtain back on that.What are the unique difficulties of creating a documentary about sexual violence, even post #MeToo?Daniels: What I think we did successfully in both seasons is throughout each story, we took a step back and had professionals break down what our survivors were going through. They really helped people who are watching the documentary understand the repercussions of sexual violence. If there was anybody who had experienced sexual violence watching the documentary, I think it helped a lot of people.What do you hope viewers take from this second season?Surviving R Kelly Part II: The Reckoning is available on Lifetime"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24a6500546dc122162a2670acb2778a6b8f5e3bd/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7eca9dc21cea929e9dc2111b3966ae28","title":"wiley vs stormzy sparks fly in grimes generation game","story":"Two of the UK’s most successful grime stars are tearing chunks out of each other with diss tracks that open up the intergenerational tensions in British rapFor many of us, January is a time to reset, exercise, and get mind and body in order for the start of a new year. But someone who clearly hasn’t downloaded any kind of mindfulness app is Wiley, the east London MC and widely acknowledged “godfather of grime”, who has spent the first week of the year whipping up chaos – and directing it at Stormzy.Top of YouTube’s trending charts, and generating gleefully mud-slinging discussion on social media, have been a pair of Stormzy-disparaging Wiley tracks: Eediyat Skengman 1 and 2. They mark the return of grime’s great sideshow: the hilarious pugilism of the diss track, where MCs “send” for each other with freestyles that mock their talent, success, family, friends, clothes, hair, trainers and obscure corners of their biographies. Grime fans will gaze into the middle distance like the historian Antony Beevor at the battle of Arnhem when you bring up such celebrated beefs as Skepta v Devilman or Chip v Big Narstie.True to form, Wiley fires off taunts about Stormzy’s breakup with Maya Jama, his friendship with Ed Sheeran (long perceived by Wiley as a “culture vulture” feeding off grime’s cred), and his mic skill. Even Stormzy’s mum’s hairdo gets threatened: “If I see your mum down Croydon market  I’m gonna rip that weave off her head, dead,” reminiscent of him accusing Lethal Bizzle’s mum of having athlete’s foot (though for hair-related sending, we must bow to Bugzy Malone’s takedown of Chip: “With that shit on the back of his head  He looks like Sonic the Hedgehog from Sega”).Stormzy responded with Disappointed. Wiley has always had a playful smirk sitting behind his disses, and rarely delivers real malice – it sounds like sport to him (as well as a rather cynical way to get his Twitter followers and general cultural standing up a notch). Stormzy, however, goes in hard, calling Wiley the c-word, and accusing him of being a crackhead from “a whole fam of rejects” – this mere weeks after Stormzy was revering his antagonist on his track Wiley Flow.However malicious or not these inidual barbs are, there’s a wider unease. Grime broke through in the mid-00s as the most exciting, experimental UK music in a generation, but initially failed to get commercial traction – it was only when Wiley embraced electro, pop and house that he reached the top of the charts. This sound was then rejected as inauthentic in grime’s second wave, as tracks such as Meridian Dan’s German Whip and Skepta’s That’s Not Me returned to a jagged palette – and indeed Stormzy, who broke through with a freestyle over one of the most beloved grime instrumentals ever, XTC’s Functions on the Low (the track in question, Shut Up, is perceived as a diss of Wiley’s brother Cadell – this stuff runs deep).With his gigantic charisma and pinpoint flow, Stormzy consolidated grime’s return to the charts – no doubt galling for Wiley, who hasn’t had a top 10 hit since 2013 (though the brilliant Boasty reached No 11 last year and was a big club hit). But with his R\u0026ampB and gospel numbers, Stormzy also pre-empted and indeed drove the subsequent marginalisation of grime as a style: US trap, UK drill and the fluid genres around Afrobeats and Afro-pop have all been much more successful in the last five years.This seems to be really what stings Wiley, whose diss tracks are as much an attempt to reassert the style he helped invent, as they are attacking Stormzy himself. On these new tracks, Wiley falls back in love with the neat battle bars that defined grime – “revenge is sweet just like nectar  I’m Achilles, you’re Hector” – and is even perhaps implicitly critical of himself. He recently collaborated with US rapper Future on the very limp R\u0026ampB single Givenchy Bag but now he’s telling Stormzy “fuck the drip” – the very high fashion Givenchy Bag was hymning – and asking “where’s the bars?” Designer labels and smooth pop tunes? That’s not me, he seems to say.The old grime guard, then, are bristling at the new, multi-genre, pop-friendly world the generation below them have built – even though they helped create it with their late-00s hits – while the new generation, whose careers have been built on the backs of pioneers like Wiley, are now lashing out at their forefathers.“This is grime, this ain’t rap”, Wiley witheringly asserts on the second diss track, placing one style above the other “You’re not on the dancefloor any more,” he tells Stormzy, valuing the raging club style of grime above the high-street pop that Stormzy has been heading towards. He also expressed dismay that Stormzy used a UK drill beat for Disappointed, and has attacked Top 10 west London rapper AJ Tracey on Twitter for his UK garage track Ladbroke Grove. Old-school grime MC Dot Rotten took Wiley’s side, saying to Stormzy in his own new diss track: “Shouldn’t you be having cups of tea with Adele?” Stormzy, meanwhile, appears unfazed, announcing on Disappointed: “They say I’m pop, I don’t mind that … the only thing bigger than me last year was Brexit,” and allies himself with Jaykae, another new-school rapper who recently taunted Wiley and Dot Rotten.All this Oedipal energy makes for a tremendously entertaining psychodrama. Not only is it a saga of intergenerational conflict, it’s also the latest chapter in UK rap’s fight with itself, as it swings back and forth between gritty authenticity and proud pop. And as Stormzy et al move out to the leafy suburbs and continue their chart runs, it won’t just be Wiley’s generation sniping at them, but a new generation of MCs hungry to set themselves apart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/558b9772f38be3acc311bdd0fafdaf46160ad59f/0_443_2673_1603/master/2673.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06b16677e27c34161f1894bc7e12e0ca","title":"assassination of qassem suleimani podcast","story":"The US drone strike on Iran’s most influential general could transform the Middle East.

However, the influential union boss went on to dismiss this on Twitter on Wednesday evening as “utter nonsense” and “fake news”.Gardiner told the  McCluskey had not asked him to run. Unite will only make a decision after the union’s executive committee meeting ends on 24 January.Gardiner, the MP for Brent North, has held his seat since 1997 and was a junior minister under Tony Blair.His reluctance to back a second EU referendum and belief that Labour should go along with the 2016 result has put him at odds with some in the shadow cabinet pushing for a more remain stance, including Starmer.He was caught mocking the shadow Brexit secretary’s six tests for a deal they could support, including the test that the government would need to prove that it could achieve the “exact same benefits” as EU membership after quitting the bloc.Gardiner was recorded saying it was “bollocks” and has also warned that a second referendum could lead to civil disobedience.His announcement on Wednesday night took rival camps by surprise, with one campaign staffer describing the news as “coming from absolutely nowhere”.Starmer currently has nominations from 24 MPs, while Rebecca Long Bailey has seven. Jess Phillips has six MP nominations, Lisa Nandy has two and Emily Thornberry has one. Clive Lewis, who was among the first to declare, has not yet received an official nomination.The contest will end on 2 April, with the winner announced two days later.Former Jeremy Corbyn staffers and allies have taken on key jobs on various leadership campaigns. Starmer has signed up Corbyn’s former chief of staff, Simon Fletcher, to be his principal strategic adviser.Momentum cofounder and chair Jon Lansman is Long Bailey’s campaign director. Former Corbyn spokesman Matt Zarb-Cousin will become her head of communications."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efd942e236305d93b480e3dd7616e970e4ecf72e/1002_503_547_328/master/547.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e7e06b0720d0d4480ba8ee63609141c","title":"banksy brunel and blaise castle a city run through bristol","story":"From jogging past world-renowned graffiti art, to hill reps up England’s steepest street, Bristol has some of the most fun and challenging runs in BritainIn the decade that I’ve been running, I’ve clocked 43 marathons in cities, mountains and even deserts all around the world. But when it comes to exciting locations to run some happy miles, there are few cities that squeeze in so much scenery, greenery and variety as Bristol. And if you enjoy splitting your time between tarmac and trails, this hilly beast of a city offers the perfect mix – with enough ups, downs and testing terrain to challenge the bravest and the fittest.With access to expansive parks and estate grounds, trails for off-road adventuring, fantastic river paths and even quad-burning towers to climb, this gateway to the West Country has become my personal running mecca. If you fancy checking it out for yourself, here are my highlights.Blaise Castle quad burnerWith free parking, a handy cafe and 260 hectares (650 acres) of parkland to explore, the Blaise Castle Estate is a wonderful – but challenging – place to lose yourself on a longer run. The grounds mix steep, groomed woodland paths with rockier trail-style climbs and descents, providing plenty to test your footwork and work your quads. The single-track woodland trails along Hazel brook make you feel like you’ve been magically whisked far from the city. For the best views – and a harder hill run – make a beeline for the 18th-century folly castle that looks down over the estate. I personally love letting loose on the way back down, putting the grip of shoes like the New Balance Fresh Foam X Hierro V5 to work.Ladies Mile intervalsA wonderful road that cuts through the green open space of Clifton Down, Ladies Mile is a flat stretch of Bristol that’s hugely popular with runners who want to escape the busier city streets. Join at Westbury Road and run through Durdham Down, for a 2-mile (3km) almost-unbroken stretch that’s perfectly punctuated with trees every 20m and shouldered on both sides by big expanses of green. You can choose to run the pavements but if you’re in a versatile road-to-trail shoe with decent grip, I recommend stepping on to the softer paths naturally worn out of the park to add a little extra difficulty – and fun. Those trees are perfect for speedy intervals and once you’re done it’s easy to swing back on to the down for some stunning easy recovery – or run on to the Clifton Observatory.Over and under the Clifton Suspension BridgeA short hop from Ladies Mile is a stunning loop that takes in Bristol’s most famous landmark – Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s Clifton Suspension Bridge. Run the Promenade and slip past the Clifton Observatory en route to the 150-year-old marvel of engineering. To get the maximum experience, run across the bridge and soak up the dizzying views of the gorge and the River Avon below. Then loop down riverside via the steep, muddy trails through Leigh Woods on either side, and run along the flat, groomed compact mud of the Avon Trail for another perspective on this incredible setting.Ashton Court Estate loopIt’s not hard to see why this Grade II* landscape, with 345 hectares (850 acres) of woodland, is one of the UK’s most popular. Set around a grand mansion house, its rolling terrain offers a winning combination of tarmac roads, hilly running trails across huge clearings and through enclosed woodland. The tree-lined driveway into the estate on a bright autumn or winter day is a real treat. I relish the challenge of burning my quads climbing the softer, grassier hills. When the work is done, you’re treated to stunning views over Bristol and surrounding countryside. There’s parking and a lovely cafe for essential post-run refuelling, too.Cabot Tower climbCabot Tower is set in the heart of Brandon Hill Park, itself a great city centre location for short looping runs with a healthy serving of hills. But if you’re looking for an alternative quick HIIT (high-intensity interval training) session, then you could try sprinting up the 108 steps of the tower. The stairs are steep and narrow so you need shoes you can trust to be sure-footed but the 360-degree views over Bristol are worth the effort. It’s open from 8.15am to 6.15pm all year round but this is a tourist hotspot so very early mornings are the best time to come.Troopers Hill marchIf you want somewhere to tackle short-but-sharp, off-road hill repeats, Troopers Hill ticks that box. Enter the nature reserve from the entrance on Troopers Hill Road and you can “enjoy” a 60m trail climb up to the tower. The mainly mud path up is stepped in parts to make it more of a challenge and each time you conquer the hill, the pay-off is a great view back down across Bristol. While you’re here, you can also explore the trails through Troopers Hill Woods.Vale Street sufferfestIn April 2019, the Ordinance Survey officially declared Vale Street a hill. Which might sound blindingly obvious when you first set eyes on the steepest street in England. With a 22-degree gradient in a 60m asphalt climb, it’s like a very short section of a mountain in disguise and, in running terms, it’s the ultimate hill reps challenge. Unlike a mountain, however, there’s nothing picturesque about this residential street to distract from the pain – so running up it isn’t for the faint-hearted. Or the unfit.Banksy Street art strollBristol’s green spaces and woodland trails are great but when you’re done tackling trails, as the spiritual home of UK street art and of course Banksy, the city’s urban roads also offer plenty of visual treats to keep you running and exploring too. The perfect way to test out the Hierro’s soft, cushioned ride, it’s easy to stitch together your very own running street-art tour. For a cultural 5K, start in Bedminster and pick your way past Banksy’s Well Hung Lover on Frogmore Street and the Girl with the Pierced Eardrum on Hanover Place before heading to the Bear Pit skatepark and exploring the streets of Stokes Croft and St Pauls.The Fresh Foam X Hierro v5 is designed to go the distance.

We always discover somewhere new, because if there’s anything Londoners can bank on in this mighty city, it’s plenty of wonderful places and trails to run – all offering an assortment of terrain, from knobbly hills to the smoothest footpaths.Ready? Get set, go ...Richmond ParkThe chance to watch deer roaming free is the usual draw of Richmond Park – a certified national nature reserve. Covering almost 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres), it is the largest royal park in London and feels like you’re stepping into a whole new world, especially if you hit the Tamsin Trail. At just over 7 miles (11 km), this well-trodden, gravelly path offers the kind of adventurous landscape that’ll convert even the most committed urban runner to the trail life. You get to enter the wild through woods and fields, and up a few moderate ascents.There are cafes and water fountains along the way if you’re using this as a long run and need a breather – or ert into the park’s woodland garden Isabella Plantation so you can stop and smell the flowers.South Bank and Victoria Embankment loopThis swift jaunt around the Thames reminds me why I call London home. I like to time a run early enough to avoid the tourists, who love the South Bank in particular. For a 5K loop, start at Blackfriars station, run south over the bridge, take a right on Upper Ground, then take another a quick right on to Marigold Alley. You’ll hit the riverside, so turn left to follow the Thames and you’ll get to tread along a flat path as you fly past Oxo Tower, the National Theatre and the surprisingly sandy beaches you can spot at low tide near the Royal Festival Hall. You’ll also catch the bright lights of the London Eye, before climbing the steps on to Westminster Bridge. Turn right under Big Ben so you are now going eastwards on the north bank of the Thames along Victoria Embankment. Stay on the riverside pavement, so you don’t have to stop to cross roads and you can enjoy the great views of the Thames and the City beyond. Check out Cleopatra’s Needle and – on the left – Somerset House, before crossing over the road at Temple station. Continue along the Embankment before finishing up at the peaceful Middle Temple Gardens.Hampstead HeathSimilar to Richmond Park, Hampstead Heath is a leafy, countryside-esque destination that offers escapism from the bustle of the city – but it’s especially my go-to when I’m in the mood to tackle some ruthless hills or to get a bit muddy on the heath’s countless trails. For an obstacle-filled adventure, I like to start from Hampstead Heath overground station, and venture into the heath from South End Road. Follow the path and you’ll soon spot Hampstead No 1 and No 2 ponds – in the summer, you might even be tempted to have a dip. Keep going until you see the path that runs between the No 2 pond and the mixed bathing pond the terrain will become wilder as you start to make the taxing ascent to Parliament Hill. Catch your breath as you take in an impressive view of the capital – you should be able to make out the Gherkin, the Shard and St Pauls Cathedral in the distance. I might do a few hill reps here, then seek out the stunning Hill Garden and Pergola, a hidden gem on the west side of the heath.Victoria ParkLike many runners in east London, I’m a massive fan of Victoria Park. From its vast fields and leafy avenues to the top-notch cafes and restored bandstand, Bonner Bridge, the Burdett Coutts fountain and new play areas, London’s oldest park is still going strong. The terrain’s also nice and flat, which makes knocking out a speedy run such a pleasure. Made up of two parts split by Grove Road, a full lap of the park covers just over 4km (2.7 miles) – but if you have more in your legs, slip on to the Hertford Union canal for eclectic scenes of street art and houseboats as you make your way towards the Lee Navigation. For another change of scenery, you can peel off towards the Olympic Park en route for a calisthenics gym and art installations commemorating the legacy of the 2012 Olympics.Tower Bridge to Islands Gardens via the Thames PathThe London leg of the Thames Path, a pleasant national trail that follows the river, is 79.5 miles (128km) that’s usually tackled in four sections either north or south of the water. Though the entire route is a beaut, the 5-mile (8km) passage from Tower Bridge to Island Gardens is particularly fascinating. The first time I ran along it, I was riveted by how it unveiled the capital’s Victorian past. You’ll head through St Katherine’s Dock and Wapping along cobbled lanes, fly past Execution Dock where pirates were once hung, and be tempted to swing by the Prospect of Whitby pub, once frequented by Charles Dickens. From here, you’ll soon notice how the capital has evolved as you make your way through Limehouse, the glass and steel of Canary Wharf and eventually Island Gardens, where the multi-surface path officially ends.Crystal Palace ParkThe ladies from the Fly Girl Collective ran their first ever race here, so it’ll always be remembered as “very, very hard” – but in a good way. The mixed, hilly terrain of this south-east London park is one of the reasons why it’s a big hit with trail-loving runners. It’s got everything – cheeky hills, grassy and stony paths, and muddy puddles after the rain. Another draw, of course, is the Grade I-listed Dinosaur Court – a quirky collection of more than 30 dinosaur sculptures that have resided in the park since 1854. To see them in all their glory, enter the park from Thicket Road entrance on the south side and do a half a mile (0.8km) loop around Lower Lake. Then, explore the rest of the park by taking the 2.5-mile (4km) circuit around its periphery, taking on some challenging hills, or seek out the infamous Crystal Palace Park maze for a fun ersion before heading back south past the athletic stadium, to swing by the park’s charming urban farm – the goats are particularly curious about passing runners.The Fresh Foam X Hierro v5 is designed to go the distance.

I’m lucky enough to call Edinburgh home and the splendour of the city never ceases to amaze me.As daylight hours shorten, many runners would happily hang up their trainers for the winter but the rush of endorphins I get while running is the best thing to stave off seasonal sadness. When anxiety hits, I find the rhythmic pounding of my feet on the pavement and focusing on my breath calms my mind. The city is full of terrific running spots – from punishing peaks, to parks, to the gentle beauty of the beach. The only real difficulty you’ll have is deciding which one to tackle first.City centre sightseeingRunning is a brilliant way to see Edinburgh’s main historical landmarks and a jog through the city centre’s hilly streets really works up a sweat. For a pavement-heavy run, start at Waverley station and run west along the city’s main shopping thoroughfare past the famous Scott Monument, through the picturesque Princes Street Gardens, crunching through fallen leaves as you head towards Lothian Road. Swing left on to Kings Stables Road, then feel the gradient increase sharply at Johnston Terrace, marvelling as Edinburgh Castle looms above you.The brave can scale the 187 steps at Castle Wynd in a sprint to the castle esplanade, home to the annual military tattoo. After the uphill effort, I like to take a moment to catch my breath as I soak up the view of my beautiful birthplace, before running from the castle down the Royal Mile to the Palace of Holyroodhouse passing St Giles’ Cathedral this is a welcome downhill jog after the castle ascent.Holyrood Park and Arthur’s SeatAdjacent to the Palace of Holyroodhouse and the Scottish Parliament building is one of Edinburgh’s most famous landmarks – Arthur’s Seat. The extinct volcano dominates Edinburgh’s skyline and if you scale the peak, which sits 251m above sea level, you’ll be rewarded with panoramic views of the city and neighbouring Fife. Arthur’s Seat sits at the centre of Holyrood Park and the whole area holds a special place in my heart – it was the scene of my first ever 5K race and where I really caught the running bug.Portobello beachJust 3 miles (5km) from the city centre lies Portobello, a popular seaside destination for Edinburgh residents since the 19th century. I’ve been coming here since I was a child and find there’s nothing quite like the invigorating power of sea air to boost your mood and a beach run is the perfect antidote to the bustle of the city centre. A popular destination with runners, particularly following its inclusion in the Edinburgh Marathon route, the section of the promenade towards Musselburgh gives you the stunning view of the Firth of Forth on one side and elegant Georgian and Victorian architecture on the other. I usually choose to sprint along the smooth Victorian boardwalk but in colder weather find myself drawn to runs along the beach which glistens with frost in the winter, enjoying the sensation of sand moving underfoot. Once I work up an appetite, I visit one of the great selection of independent bars and cafes on the promenade for post-run refuelling.Water of Leith walkwayA combination of paved path and gravel track, this 12-mile (19km) walkway snakes through the city from the foot of the Pentland Hills to the port of Leith and is great for runners who enjoy off-road, traffic-free running, as I do. The route takes you through some of Edinburgh’s most attractive neighbourhoods and my favourite stretch of the path runs from the Shore in Leith to the Gallery of Modern Art via the Royal Botanic Gardens, swanky Stockbridge and the delightful Dean village. The area around the Dean village is particularly charming and features a fast-flowing, roaring current, tree-lined paths and bridges across the water.The running trail can sometimes get a bit muddy, so an all-terrain shoe is very much needed, and the waterway is home to lush vegetation, an abundance of wildlife and six life-size humanoid sculptures by award-winning artist Antony Gormley. As well as being a popular path for runners, you’ll also find the route frequented by friendly dog walkers, cyclists and even the occasional horse rider.Inverleith ParkJust to the north of the New Town and Stockbridge, you’ll find Inverleith Park – a sanctuary of green space in the heart of the capital and one of Scotland’s largest urban parks at 22 hectares (54 acres). Inverleith boasts a wonderful view of Edinburgh Castle and is a favourite spot for locals to assemble to watch the various firework displays that take place towards the end of the year.I love Inverleith because it’s a park that’s got something for everyone, including sports pitches, allotments, a pond and a children’s play area. The tree-lined park splits into four near equal parts by a combination of concrete path and muddy trail – and my favourite running routes takes the form of a figure of eight circuit of the grounds. I always make a point of visiting the recently installed wet garden, which includes a range of plant species that will help reduce blue-green algae in the water. A wooden boardwalk provides access to the area to view the flora and fauna that now inhabit the pond."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/416445cc8406201b0033fbf7f9c41cf6107122a5/0_330_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f6ce039ea8bb4f7442f0821f52772e8","title":"cheltenham quash speculation fifth day festival horse racing","story":"Cheltenham racecourse insisted on Wednesday it has “no plans” to add a fifth day to its Festival meeting in March or switch to a Wednesday-to-Saturday format, in response to a newspaper column in which the trainer Alan King suggested he had been won around to the idea of a five-day Festival following a “long chat” with the track’s new chairman, Martin St Quinton.King’s weekly column in the Racing Post’s Weekender publication reports St Quinton as arguing that extending the current Tuesday-to-Friday Festival to Saturday would “attract a different crowd, rather as they do on the Saturday at Royal Ascot”, while either the Ryanair Chase or the Stayers’ Hurdle would move from its current slot on Thursday to be the new extra day’s feature event.Speculation the Festival could be extended to five days next year has been widespread since New Year’s Day, when St Quinton declined to rule out the possibility in an interview with ITV Racing.“It would get a lot of opposition,” St Quinton, who replaced Robert Waley-Cohen as Cheltenham’s chairman in October, said, “but people don’t like change. People complained when it went from three days to four, but now everybody loves the four-day Festival.“Royal Ascot was very similar with the Heath meeting on the Saturday and now that is their most popular day, so you’ve got to be open-minded about these things.”Cheltenham issued a blunt denial of the claims on Wednesday, however. “We have four fantastic days of the Festival running Tuesday to Friday,” a spokesperson for the track said, “and no plans for a fifth day.”Like any well-run business, Cheltenham is generally keen to keep its options open and not rule anything out. Yet the commercial case for a Saturday at the Festival, whether it is as part of a four- or five-day meeting, is not as clear-cut as some recent speculation might suggest. The demand for high-margin corporate hospitality packages, for instance, would be expected to fall significantly on Saturday, leaving a hole in the balance sheet that would be difficult to fill.Comparisons with Royal Ascot, meanwhile, could also be misleading. Ascot is less than an hour from London by train, while Cheltenham is at least two hours even on a direct train and its station is more than two miles from the track.A Saturday in June faces also very little competition from other sports. A Cheltenham Saturday in March, on the other hand, would be staged at the height of the football and rugby union seasons, and face fierce competition for ticket sales, television viewers, airtime and media coverage. With the weather also a big factor for what could be much more of a “walk-up” crowd, attracting and keeping a “different crowd” on a Festival Saturday could well be a much sterner task than many suppose."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34325992d9e630ad16aba8af65a9f70955d4368c/0_135_3308_1985/master/3308.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b2acd895ef3138039a128517be22f8b","title":"england jack leach spin joe root south africa","story":"Bowler is finally out of quarantine and might provide more penetration against all those South Africa right-handersThere is relief as well as jubilation for England. After four matches Chris Silverwood has now overseen a Test victory. It is Joe Root’s 18th win as captain, the same number as Mike Brearley as it happens (though he does lose rather more frequently) yet he often seems to be under pressure. That has eased a bit more.In Cape Town Root batted extremely well for his 96 runs, yet that will not satisfy him – or his critics. The more runs he scores the better captain he seems to become, a feature he does not necessarily share with Brearley.Everything clicked at Newlands Root won the toss, he juggled his bowling attack adroitly even when Jimmy Anderson was no longer an option. England’s outcricket was not quite flawless yet it was exceptional – it had to be for them to win this game on a surface that became easier to bat on. And a few little ploys worked very well: showing faith in Dom Bess so early in South Africa’s first innings, tossing the ball to Joe Denly, stationing a leg slip for Stuart Broad and having a catch taken there from the next ball, bowling Ben Stokes at the end (actually, everyone inside Newlands realised that this was quite a good idea).This will be one of Root’s treasured victories it took place overseas, where England have struggled recently it came at a time when the tour was threatening to disintegrate in the wake of a flu epidemic and a freak injury to their senior opening batsman. There were four kids under 23 in the team, whose naivety and freshness became an asset. And they had to work so hard to cross the line with no more than 50 balls remaining.It is no wonder Silverwood, a measured man, was beaming afterwards. “We’ve had a tough couple of weeks leading up to this and to come out and see a team performance like that – especially with some of the youngsters – I’m absolutely thrilled and proud of them,” said England’s head coach.The injury to Rory Burns could easily have been the final straw. Not only was it very inconvenient, it was humiliating as well since it happened when he was playing football, an activity the players love, but which can be considered an unnecessary risk. The loss of Burns – for four months as we now discover – was another shred of evidence for those who had already decided that this expedition was a shambles and that regime change was essential.The nippers all made handy contributions throughout but the decisive ones came from more familiar names. Stokes drove the team home with his catching, his explosive second-innings batting, which gained so much time to bowl South Africa out, and that last spell.It is becoming tricky for coaches to find fresh superlatives for Stokes but Silverwood had a go. “When it gets tough he’s the one you want in there – he fights, doesn’t know how to give up. He did it again for us here. He picked the ball up, charged in and made things happen for us. Again it’s an inspiration for everyone around him. His energy gets everyone going.”Stokes was Bothamesque in that final spell because it became apparent that he was going to bowl them out come what may. We were not sure how that would be done but somehow it was always going to happen as he hurtled in from the Wynberg End. However, the parallel with Botham is not exact as Silverwood’s next observation demonstrates.“I think you’ve all seen the way he trains. The amount of hours and effort he puts in to make sure he’s properly prepared out on the field. And for any young kid coming in to see how he does things gives them a real realisation of what it takes to play international cricket. He’s setting the standards from a fitness point of view. His attitude time and time again is superb, so he’s a great talisman.”Jofra Archer would be the obvious replacement in Port Elizabeth in a week’s time – provided he is fully fit. Other changes are possible after much staring at the surface there. The enforced experiment with Crawley at the top of the order will surely continue but there will be more debate over which spinner to play. Jack Leach finally emerged from quarantine at Cape Town and has been training. He was on hand to watch and encourage Bess, who bowled excellently, but Leach might provide more penetration against all those right-handers.So there is plenty for the brains trust to contemplate during their week of rest and recuperation, but they will do so in the warm glow of a memorable victory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f75be72b3b26bb4b873789c54d29b67fdc960b9/0_96_2880_1728/master/2880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6780d27cae9119fbec886a966cba2183","title":"atp cup quarter final australia v great britain live","story":"Third set: Evans 7-6(7-4), 4-6, 4-2 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Evans’ Team GB posse are offering words of encouragement. “Big push mate,” they tell their compatriot. And push he does the serving de Minaur, who double faults the first point and undoes all the good work from the previous game by giving Evans multiple break points. De Minaur uses his last challenge trying to claim an Evans’ shot is long of the baseline but Hawkeye shows it’s 1mm in. Still, the Aussie persists and yet another backhand winner - he’s tallied 16 to Evans’ six - makes it 30-40. No matter, Evans reigns in the next point.And here’s the full report of that shock result at the Brisbane International:Third set: Evans* 7-6(7-4), 4-6, 3-2 de Minaur (*denotes server): What were we saying about errors? Evans makes one on serve at 30-30 and gifts de Minaur a break point. But de Minaur has no chance of returning his next serve, which was a bit of a rocket, and it’s deuce. Ad Evans. Back to deuce. Evans approaches for the volley and de Minaur returns low but with just enough venom that the Brit mucks up his forehand volley. Deuce. Ad Evans. Deuce.More tussling and tangoing and de Minaur, as he has done throughout this riveting, see-saw match, forces Evans to take that extra shot. Ad de Minaur. Evans dispatches a rare missed first serve and his second isn’t strong enough to stop the Demon unleashing a cracking backhand to break back.Third set: Evans 7-6(7-4), 4-6, 3-1 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Evans has taken the most risks throughout this affair and de Minaur played it a little safer. Sometimes it means additional errors, as in two of the three first points of this game that allow de Minaur to sail to 40-0. At others, it manifests in a build-up and winner that doesn’t give his opponent time to blink, like when he rallies back to 40-15. And sometimes it forces his opponent to step up another gear, as de Minaur did to hold this particular game.Third set: *Evans 7-6(7-4), 4-6, 3-0 de Minaur (*denotes server): The wind is in the British sails now. Has de Minaur got what it takes to deflate them and hit back straight away? Not with Evans serving as he is. An ace down the T at 40-15 up brings up a three-game advantage for Great Britain and leaves Australia with it all to do now.Third set: Evans 7-6(7-4), 4-6, 2-0 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Clearly buoyed by how that last game ended, Evans manages to bring up a break point in this next game, much to the delight of his pumped up teammates on the sidelines. But de Minaur is more than equal to it, lunging to reach a perfectly executed volley at the net. The Australian’s radar is off a point later as he seeks to close out the game – he challenges, unsuccessfully – and we go again. Evans brings up another break point and this time he takes it, sparking a flurry of congratulatory chat from his teammates. “Great pressure mate, all over ‘im! Great stuff Evo!” Advantage GB.Third set: *Evans 7-6(7-4), 4-6, 1-0 de Minaur (*denotes server): And with impeccable timing, Channel Nine conks out, just as the third and deciding set is about to get underway. A black screen is all I have to go off, so not much chance of telling you what happened in the first four points of the game. Sorry about that. But we’re back with images now and De Minaur is 40-15 up. Evans manages to save one of those break points before he runs around a forehand to fire a winner down the line and level things up at deuce. Another forehand winner later and Evans stands on the brink of holding. Out comes a big serve which de Minaur can’t return and the momentum the Australian held at the outset dissipates. Tremendous fight from Evans there.Second set: Evans 7-6(7-4) 4-6 de Minaur* (*denotes server): This game is essentially the previous game in reverse. De Minaur has three set points at 40-0 before Evans pushes him back to deuce. Hewitt and Evans share some words between points. We imagine they weren’t very nice. Maybe it’s just coincidence but when play resumes de Minaur absolutely nails a forehand for the advantage and then unloads another to seal the game and set.A nightmare scenario materialises for Barty as she loses the second set on a tie-break and the match to Jennifer Brady, the American qualifier. The world No 1 falls 6-4, 7-6(7-4) to the 24-year-old from Pennsylvania in a huge upset. Might the long lead-in time to the match have played its part in Barty’s demise? More to come on that one, surely. Second set: Evans* 7-6(7-4) 4-5 de Minaur (*denotes server): Hmmm, not so fast. Evans is clearly determined to close out this match and rushes 40-0. No sooner have blinked than de Minaur makes it deuce, sealed by a drop shot that caught Evans utterly and completely off guard. To be fair, he returns the favour with a glorious angled winner to take the advantage. De Minaur gives him one back. Then, blimey. An Evans shot has de Minaur pulls so far out of court he has to put extra on his response to offset the acute angle. The manner with which he does so has Lleyton Hewitt and Nick Kyrgios wide-eyed and open-mouthed in the stands. The pair trade advantages and there’s a bee’s whisker in this. De Minaur elicits a thumbs-up from Evans when he reigns supreme in a superb rally. In the end, though, Evans stays strong and denies his Australian opponent a second break.Nick Kyrgios is a happy camper. There can be no doubting the Australian, who put his team into a 1-0 lead earlier on, is absolutely loving this tournament and the team format. He laughed and joked his way through the rubber against Cam Norrie and played with a joy that is sometimes lacking from his game. Second set: Evans 7-6(7-4) 3-5 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Evans executes a short shot that sneaks just over the net and nestles inside the line. He thinks it’s good enough, until de Minaur races down for a straight-barrelled shot down the line. This game plays host to some classic high-stakes tennis complete with dummy runs and sneaky slices, and it’s a half-volley from Evans that takes the score to deuce. But de Minaur holds his nerve and the game, and can now win the set if he breaks in the next game.Second set: Evans* 7-6(7-4) 3-4 de Minaur (*denotes server): We do love a lob! De Minaur’s approach shot to the baseline was inch-perfect but Evans matched and then raised him one with a high ball over his head to draw ahead 30-15. One Evans backhand winner and one de Minaur smash later and we’re at 40-30. The game, in the end, belongs to Evans. And while there’s still just one game in this set Australia are well and truly back in the mix. Toe-to-toe stuff. De Minaur must ensure he doesn’t allow errors to creep in as he did in the first set.Second set: Evans 7-6(7-4) 2-4 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Phew. Crisis averted as de Minaur fights back from two break points and two advantages before a bullet serve is too much for Evans and he holds serve. It didn’t start so positive for the Aussie. There’s nothing wrong with two top-draw, top-spin forehands but Evans is handed a favour when his reply nicks the net and sneaks over just out of reach. Patient aggression in the subsequent two rallies helps the Brit to 15-40 but de Minaur denies him the break and pushes to deuce. Suddenly Evans is at the net defending himself against a barrage of brutal shots, the last of which he’s simply no chance. De Minaur can’t close out the first advantage but he’s good for the second.Second set: Evans* 7-6(7-4) 2-3 de Minaur (*denotes server): Some fancy Australian footwork gives de Minaur an early advantage, but then he challenges Evans’ serve and alas, it’s nicked the line. Evans starts to feast at the baseline and slice, slice, slice, before de Minaur bottles his shot and the game.Ash Barty in trouble. Meanwhile, up in Brisbane, things aren’t going entirely to plan for Australia’s top player. The world No 1 has dropped the first set of her WTA tournament opener having been made to wait until today to play. American qualifier Jennifer Brady, who saw off Maria Sharapova in her opener on an outside court earlier this week, took the first set 6-4, heaping the pressure on Barty’s shoulders as she now seeks to recover and avoid a disappointing and unexpected early exit. Second set: Evans 7-6(7-4) 1-3 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Crucial game and the key for both is to hold their respective nerves. De Minaur attempts to up the ante on a long baseline rally and is rebuffed by the net, but Evans smashes a shot out in the next point and we’re back at 15-15. De Minaur takes the third point and a robust forehand forces another Evans error. One ace later and thank you very much, de Minaur is doing some damage.Second set: Evans* 7-6(7-4) 1-2 de Minaur (*denotes server): Evans down 15-30 and a simple return from de Minaur prompts a wayward shot. Can the 20-year-old break for Team Australia and dig himself out of this hole? Of course he can. Evans has him running back towards the baseline but the Brit isn’t expecting the ball to come back and out of reach.Second set: Evans 7-6(7-4) 1-1 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Welcome back de Minaur. Just when we thought he was on the backfoot he holds his service game to love, forcing his combatant into two errors on the way. Second set: Evans* 7-6(7-4) 1-0 de Minaur (*denotes server): Evans races ahead to 30-15 but can do nothing about a searing backhand from de Minaur that nestles right on the baseline in the back corner. Nonetheless, he maintains composure with a winner of his own for 40-30 and takes the game courtesy of an unforced error from the Australian.Afternoon all. Right, Evans has taken a much-needed first set for Team GB and given de Minaur a lot to do in the second.Right, that’s a good time for me to pass on the baton to Emma Kemp. Thanks for your company today.First set: Evans* 7-6 de Minaur (*denotes server): Superbly constructed point from Evans crafts two set points for Great Britain. Then de Minaur dumps a return into the net and the set is Evans’!First set: Evans 6-6 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Evans immediately snatches a mini-break back after de Minaur nets following a superb rally, reminiscent of the opening couple of games earlier in the match. First set: Evans* 6-6 de Minaur (*denotes server): Evans wins his first point easily but then he is blown off court by a rasping return winner. De Minaur back on serve. First set: Evans 6-6 de Minaur* (*denotes server): De Minaur still looks bothered by that missed smash but he pulls it together on his own serve.First set: Evans* 6-6 de Minaur (*denotes server): Wow! de Minaur misses the smash! A total fresh air swing to an Evans lob lost in the new canopy of the Ken Rosewall Arena. Kyrgios has issues with it earlier in the morning, and now this absolute shocker. His pain is doubled when Evans benefits from a very fortunate net cord to move up 2-0. First set: Evans* 6-6 de Minaur (*denotes server): Evans races to 30-0 but de Minaur steps it up with a scintillating one-two punch, first a lob fizzing with topspin, then a leaping crosscourt backhand that practically took the line with it on its way to 30-15. That’s as good as it gets for de Minuar though and Evans holds to 15. First set: Evans 5-6 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Evans has snatched for a couple of winners earlier in rallies than he perhaps has needed to, and he does so again in de Minaur’s latest service game, handing his opponent a quick and easy hold. Again Evans will serve to say in the set. First set: Evans* 5-5 de Minaur (*denotes server): Both players open cautiously in a game of vital importance but de Minaur still manages to overshoot the runway. He returns to his power game to level but some excellent Evans serving takes him out to 40-15 with two shot points. A thrilling leaping overhead backhand from de Minaur intercepts a well-targeted lob, adding a frisson to the contest. Evans senses the change in energy and is handed a violation for taking too long over his serve, a point he subsequently loses.No bother. Evans controlled deuce off his racquet to level at 5-5.First set: Evans 4-5 de Minaur* (*denotes server): At 15-15 de Minaur seems to be getting into his head a little but Evans searches unnecessarily for a winner to gift 30-15, then an ace gives the Australian some breathing space. A comprehensive smash means Evans will walk away from the changeover needing to hold serve to remain in the set. First set: Evans* 4-4 de Minaur (*denotes server): You know when a rally’s good on this court without even needing to open your eyes because the sound of the players’ sneakers squeaking is its own symphony. The best rally since game three ends in favour of Evans, who presses home his advantage to move to 40-0 despite de Minaur thrashing a return to his toes. A second ace keeps us level pegging.First set: Evans 3-4 de Minaur* (*denotes server): De Minaur needs an easy, steadying service game, and he gets it, holding to love, sealing the deal with a thumping forehand. First set: Evans* 3-3 de Minaur (*denotes server): “Actions speak louder than words” Henman tells Evans at the change, focussing his charge while he engages in running dialogue with the Australian bench. The Briton is benefiting from an increasing number of errors creeping into de Minaur’s game, a fluffed return at 30-15 in particular a missed opportunity. Evans holds to return to parity after trailing 0-3 early. If Kyrgios plays like he did today for the remainder of January he’ll make tennis a front page sport in Australia. First set: Evans 2-3 de Minaur* (*denotes server): There’s an urgency to de Minaur that makes for compelling watching. He reaches the ball a fraction before you expect and his racquet comes through quicker than you’re prepared for, and when he loads up the big forehand crosscourt it’s got more oomph than you’d imagine for a man his size.That said, he leaks from 15-0 to 15-40 with some needless errors and despite clawing back to 30-40 he fails to defend the second break point when Evans pummels a forehand down the line. A welcome break of serve for Great Britain and a disappointing game for de Minaur. First set: Evans* 1-3 de Minaur (*denotes server): Henman talks of “targets” and “points on your terms” to Dan Evans at the change of ends, and he gets a few cheapies to settle any nerves. After those epic opening two games the match has dipped into a much more error-strewn contest. First set: Evans 0-3 de Minaur* (*denotes server): A comparatively straightforward service hold for de Minaur in the circumstances and Australia race into a 3-0 advantage. First set: Evans* 0-2 de Minaur (*denotes server): Already this match has settled into a rhythm of long technical rallies. From one of those, lasting 28-shots, De Minaur puts away a volley to move to 0-30. Evans digs in and drills a Federer-like single-handed pass after another gruelling exchange to tie things up at 30-30. A rare unforced error from de Minaur offers Evans game point but another superb demonstration of hitting from both men ends with deuce. This is glorious tennis, full of tempo changes and precision stroke-making. Evans pulls out his best serve of the match at deuce to gain a second game point but de Minaur’s hustle sees it off. Evans gets another look but de Minaur refuses to relent. A third game point is saved with a monstrous forehand return then the Australian seizes the initiative with a forehand-backhand one-two punch. This has been a wonderful game, de Minaur’s returning in particular exceptional. And it earns him an early break! The pressure on the Evans serve was too much and, with both men already red faced and sweating profusely, de Minaur steals an early march. Evans likes a bit of chirp. This will be worth keeping an eye on. First set: Evans 0-1 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Right from the off, the opening point is very structured and deliberate, both players using a range of strokes, spins and slices, before Evans finds the net with a volley coming into the net. There’s a pause while the video review confirms a de Minaur foot fault, a delay preceding two more punishing rallies that end the way of the Australian, the second of which culminating in a superb winner from de Minaur that hit the corner with him at full stretch on his forehand side. He serves out a love game comfortably. Here we go, de Minaur to serve.This should be an interesting match-up. Neither player is likely to blast the other off court (a la Kyrgios) with both earning reputations for their court coverage of variety of strokes. Rankings-wise de Minaur should be favoured, but there’s only a few hundred points separating the pair in the live standings. As with the opening match this pair have met just once before with the advantage going the way of the Great Briton at last year’s Rogers Cup. Attention now turns to Dan Evans v Alex de Minaur."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0ef59a897efee4b273258b5f58495645145f8cf/0_358_5364_3218/master/5364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5676fc3a757e5cbe5d53b82de2a69d6f","title":"send tip healthy holidays europe win 200 pound hotel voucher","story":"Whether it was yoga or mindfulness, a spa break or immersion in nature, we’d love to hear about breaks in Europe that have given you a sense of wellbeingPerhaps you’ve kickstarted an exercise campaign or rebooted yourself with a meditation holiday.

Share your stories The American Embassy in Baghdad is calling for all US citizens in Iraq to leave the country as soon as possible.In the early hours of 3 January, Iran’s most powerful general Qassem Suleimani was killed outside Baghdad airport in an airstrike sanctioned by the US President, Donald Trump. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, de-facto leader of the Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, the Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU), and close associate of Suleimani, also died in the attack.The killing represents a significant acceleration in the escalation of tensions between the US and Iran. It followed just hours after the conclusion of a two-day siege against the US embassy in Baghdad by PMU militants, which was prompted by a US airstrike camps belonging to a PMU-affiliated militia, itself a response to that group’s killing of a US contractor at an Iraqi army base.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has sworn revenge for Suleimani’s death.The embassy said in a statement that it “urges American Citizens to heed the January 2020 Travel Advisory and depart Iraq immediately. US citizens should depart via airline while possible, and failing that, to other countries by land.”“Due to Iranian-backed militia attacks at the US Embassy compound, all public consular operations are suspended until further notice”, the statement added.We would like to hear from you if you are a US citizen in Iraq, or if you know someone who has been affected by the order to evacuate.Though we’d like to hear from you, your security is most important.

Police responded with a baton charge and fired teargas and rubber bullets. At least 55 people were arrested.Public transport was hit, with reduced bus and train services. There was little movement on the streets of Bihar state due to auto-rickshaw drivers joining in the strike. Kerala was similarly affected, with few buses running and banks largely remaining closed.In some towns, few shops or banks were open, although the capital, Delhi, and the commercial centre, Mumbai, saw relatively little disruption.Tens of thousands of workers affiliated to trade unions turned out in many cities, braving rain to demonstrate in parks and public places against the slowdown.“I have worked like a slave to educate my four sons. In India sons are meant to be an asset but my sons are graduates and not one has a job. I have to support them on my salary,” said Avinesh Sethi, a driver in Chandigarh, in Punjab.Gloom over chronic unemployment has been rising since well before Modi was re-elected for a second term last May. Last year’s figures showed the highest unemployment in 45 years. The sluggish economy has hit rural India the hardest, with farming families reportedly unable to afford common items such as shampoo.On Tuesday, the economics Nobel prize winner Abhijit Banerjee told an audience in Mumbai: “We are extremely close to a tipping point of a major recession.”As the bad news mounts, alongside criticism from economists, Modi has cut back his talk of making India a a $5tn (£3.8tn) a year economy by 2025.“Forget that nonsense of trillion-dollar economy,” said Subhashini Ali, a Communist party leader who participated in the strike in Delhi. “When this strike was originally called, it was to register anger against anti-labour laws and the selling-off of the country’s assets. But now it’s broader because there are no jobs. The future of young people is being destroyed by Modi.”Amarjeet Kaur, a trade union leader, said workers were opposed to the proposed sale of natural resources and state assets. “The working class is on the streets today,” she said.The unions said hundreds of thousands of workers would lose jobs if the government went ahead with the sale of Air India, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, the Shipping Corporation of India and the Container Corporation of India. The government says it plans to sell the companies because they have been losing money for years.Alongside the general strike, protests against the government’s new citizenship law, which discriminates against Muslims, continued in several places. There was a large protest at Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islamia University, which has been at the centre of nationwide demonstrations against the law."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85cfbdb09d58da0a96ca9cfaf45b41fb5c40fca0/0_135_1440_864/master/1440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e59a5d8984085b221c1f45136b721e24","title":"on the frontline of the climate emergency bangladesh adapts","story":"Farmers in delta lowlands are discovering innovative answers to floods and stormsIn the scorching farmlands of south-west Bangladesh, a single coconut tree stands as a barometer of climate change.Dulal Mondal, 70, a farmer, points halfway up the tree about two feet off the ground to indicate where the waters came the last time the area flooded.“Next time if heavy rain comes I don’t think water will recede as there is no natural draining or anywhere for it to go,” he says.Mondal lives in the Jessore district of Bangladesh where increased levels of salt in the water, uneven rainfall and flooding are creating great uncertainty for a whole farming community.Bangladesh is one of dozens of countries on the frontline of the climate emergency. Here global heating is no theoretical calamity of the future, but a very real, present danger.Here, the climate crisis is so palpable that the debate is not about restricting carbon emissions or preventing global warming but about how to adapt to the change and survive in times of unpredictable weather.For example, Mondal says that where once his peers would farm mainly rice, now they have taken to fishing. They use floating cages, allowing fish to breed in a secure area. Also, if water levels rise, the cages will too, so flooding is less of an issue.“About 20 to 30 years ago there would be a minimum of two crops per farming family but now because of waterlogging we have no more than one,” he says. Each cage is owned by one home and yields about 15,000 taka (£135) in additional income for the families a year. It’s also a consistent source of food, which could be vital if natural disaster hits. “In the last two years there was not too much rain but two years ago we were flooded,” Mondal says. “We worry about the future. If there is heavy rainfall the water could remain logged for a long period of time and we would have to take shelter on main road. We would stay there with our remaining belongings.”This farming evolution is just one element of a whole range of climate change adaptive practices taking root across southern Bangladesh, an area long prone to cyclones, rising sea levels and drought.“What’s important is investment in long-term development, to help people adapt to the effects that climate change is having now and help them to not only survive but thrive in their new climate reality,” said Adib Hossain, the head of programmes implementation at Practical Action, one of the charities helping to make changes.In this part of Bangladesh they have helped introduce effective fertilisers to increase crop growth as well as growing fish in cages and vegetation in sacks or beside rivers – a novel farming technique known as a “dyke garden”.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThe cages are made using cheap materials. Bamboo poles form an outer frame that can float and is covered in netting. They have a top cover to prevent fish jumping and escaping, or being caught by birds. With a capacity of one cubic metre, they hold up to 300 fish at a time. These cages are used for two growing seasons each year.The fish can be fed on scraps and waste – duckweed, oil cake, kitchen waste, rice bran and snails – and in just a few months they grow to full size.A woman standing beside Mondal goes down in a small wooden boat and pulls up the mesh cage, within which fish jump up and splutter around. She drops the net and they swim around once more. For the worried farmers in this area, the introduction of these cages has been reassuring, a constant amid a lot of inconsistency.In the nearby district of South Atulia another innovative technique has been employed. Land here is being used for fishing, with pools of water separated by a cracked mud path and spiky vegetation. Omal Biswas, 48, has three daughters and an adopted son. He used to farm rice once a year and during the monsoon he would fish in freshwater. Now he is able to make more money with dyke gardening techniques, growing vegetables around pools of water used for fishing.Omal has just harvested a crop, he says. They grow bottle gourd, chillis, indian spinach, red amaranth, sponge gourd, ridge gourd and tomatoes. “Before this technology was used I would yield around 20-25,000 taka a year but last year I harvested 120,000 taka through using different varieties of vegetables and growing more in the year.“Now I can grow vegetables while fishing but I used to rotate the land. I eat the vegetables too,” he adds. He adds that the additional income helps give them a better quality of life and now he has been able to buy six cows. “The cost of living is rising and the cost of production is increasing so it is a good portion of revenue,” he says.Practical Action isn’t the only charity supporting farmers. The National Agriculture Technology Program (NATP 2) by the World Bank has also helped people adopt resilient farming methods.Farmers have deployed ancient agricultural methods such as floating beds, which involve sowing crops onto floating islands made of the fast-growing water hyacinth. Crops such as cucumbers, gourds and eggplants flourish. Beds are raised so as to lie above the reach of tidal surges. In between, trenches serve as pools to farm fish and ducks.Others have turned to shrimp farming after land was flooded but Practical Action has helped people do this in a more effective way.Rubina Khatun is one woman who has benefited from this. “The cyclone affected my family. I swam across flood waters with my two sons and took refuge on the road and sheltered in a shop we own for two months. Then we returned to our home,” she says.Shrimp farming is now a major source of income for her family. The technique used to farm the shrimp more effectively includes using deeper water so the temperature does not change as quickly, and adding a fertiliser made from oil cake, date juice and sugar cane among other things.“I am not sure what I would do without it now,” Khatun says. “But this type of farming is weather dependent. We need rain. If there is less rainfall salinity increases.”Despite efforts to improve the situation, Bangladesh remains at the mercy of sharp changes in weather patterns. Deep uncertainty persists for millions, even if these newfound techniques are helped to mitigate environmental impact.“I am worried,” Khatun says. “Too much or too little rain, both are problematic.”For her, however, the concept of climate change is a world away. “I can feel it in terms of rain but I am not aware of this. I have heard non-government-organisations talking about it but just as a concept. All I know is shrimp farming is a major source of income out of all the ones remaining, so it’s a reassurance.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill The prospect of a united Ireland had been pushed back and reconciliation undermined by the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) commemoration controversy, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.Mr Varadkar accused “some elements of the Opposition” of false claims and misrepresentation – notably that the event would be “a celebration of the Black and Tans”.He said Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan had made the right decision on Tuesday to defer the event, a decision made with his imprimatur. However, in a further twist on Wednesday, a Minister said the list of centenary commemorations for 2020 that came to Cabinet for approval before Christmas did not include the RIC event.Chief whip Sean Kyne told Nuacht TG4 that a list was read out of proposed events, including occasions to mark the burning of Cork, the murder of Cork’s lord mayor Tomás MacCurtain, the sacking of Balbriggan and the execution of Kevin Barry.The Department of Justice said it was the Minister rather than the Government who had taken the lead in organising it because the two organisations in question were police services. Mr Varadkar accepted lessons could be learned from the controversy, and “perhaps things could have been handled differently”.He said it had become an issue of unnecessary controversy, and he hoped the commemoration could be held at a later date after consultation with the Opposition and others.Speaking at the BT Young Scientist \u0026amp Technology Exhibition in Dublin, the Taoiseach said he “firmly believes in a united Ireland”, and that it could be achieved in his lifetime. A united Ireland, however, was about a different state and “must be one that recognises our shared history”, and the fact that there were one million people on the island who identify as British and as being from a unionist background.The controversy was a setback for unity and reconciliation, he added.Unionist reaction Unionist politicians have deplored the decision by Mr Flanagan to call off the planned commemoration for the RIC.The DUP, Ulster Unionist Party and the Traditional Unionist voice said the decision and the reaction to the proposal raised questions about how unionists would be treated in a united Ireland.“Those leading the vehement opposition to this event are the same people who tell those of us in Northern Ireland that British identity would be respected and accommodated within some mythical ‘new Ireland’,” said Jeffrey Donaldson. “When agreement cannot be found to commemorate those who died 100 years ago it is a clear demonstration of how far we still have to travel in terms of respect and reconciliation, particularly in relation to the British identity in Northern Ireland by republicans.” Mr Donaldson said that those who served in the RIC and the Dublin politan Police “were Irish men and women from all religious backgrounds who lived and worked in an Ireland that was politically united”.“Many of them suffered or were murdered for no reason other than the fact they wore a crown on their uniform, and it is difficult to escape the conclusion that opposition to this commemoration is based again on that.” Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said the decision was “disappointing, but not surprising given the tone of the debate and the language used by some of the leaders and elected representatives of political parties in the Republic of Ireland”. “It exposed a direct and underlying contradiction to their previous public statements about reconciliation,” he said. HostileMr Aiken said that describing members of the RIC as “colonialists” and “oppressors” when the “vast majority of these men came from the island of Ireland, and served their communities with dedication, is an insult to their memory and their descendants”. “These types of comments do nothing to build reconciliation, and demonstrate that some elements of society with the Republic of Ireland remain openly hostile to the British identity or those perceived to be associated with it. “This hostility will not be lost on unionists who are the subject of repeated entreaties to consider embracing Irish unity and who are constantly assured that all would be well. Actions really do speak louder than words,” said Mr Aiken. TUV leader Jim Allister said the “climbdown” by the Government was a “telling signal to unionists as to how they and their history would be treated in an all-Ireland”.“If a predominantly Roman Catholic state police force from the South is so vilified by republican agitators, in a supposedly enlightened and modern state, that its government toadies to such bigotry, we can all imagine how unionist culture and traditions would fare in such a republican utopia.”Minister for Business Heather Humphreys, who is a TD in the Border region for Cavan-Monaghan, said she agreed with the postponement of the event but she stressed it should go ahead at a future date.“There was a lot of misinformation about this particular commemoration. It was certainly never about commemorating anything to do with the Black and Tans. It was about remembering the Irish men that lost their lives while working for the RIC, and it’s important that we remember all Irish lives that were lost,” she told reporters at an IDA Ireland event in Dublin.“I do look forward to it taking place. A number of people have contacted me because their family members have served in the RIC and they did make sacrifices, and I do believe that they deserve to be remembered.”Ms Humphreys said she did not mind when the commemoration took place “as long as it takes place”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4134152.1578526210!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"shane ross going to cabinet meetings was a weekly ambush","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Minister for Transport Shane Ross. Suggestions he has neglected his brief for pet projects are rejected as a ‘myth’.  Photograph: Alan BetsonIn a few weeks from now, Shane Ross hopes to find himself in the same position he was four years ago: re-elected to the Dáil and negotiating with potential coalition partners on participation in government.In 2016, he was dealing with Enda Kenny for Fine Gael and Micheál Martin for Fianna Fáil as the 32nd Dáil struggled to make sense of the inconclusive result thrown up by that February’s election.Kenny, with whom Ross had a testy relationship, has since departed, replaced by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Martin still leads Fianna Fáil, and has targeted Ross for repeated criticism over the past four years.“Micheál can do what he likes,” Ross says, before recalling the torturous 2016 Government formation negotiations.“There’s a funny thing about the last negotiations,” says Ross. “Fianna Fáil was much easier to negotiate with.”Martin’s party, the Dublin Rathdown TD said, was willing to agree to whatever Ross and others wanted.“Fine Gael is much more kind of inflexible when you’re negotiating with them.The Fine Gael “background”, according to Ross, is that they “have strong convictions”.Slow progressThe Judicial Appointments Commission Bill championed by Ross has taken years to progress, and has still not passed all stages in the Oireachtas.It was the cause of many of his rows with Kenny, and Ross acknowledges he blocked the appointment of judges at Cabinet because of slow progress on his Bill.Ross says that it took himself and Finian McGrath, the other alliance member who attends Cabinet, a year or two to settle into Government.“We didn’t feel very comfortable in Government and we felt we were almost the opposition sitting at the Cabinet table at one stage.“The first few weeks were real hell. I had a very bad relationship with Enda Kenny, to start with. Going to Cabinet meetings was a weekly ambush.”Relations got off to a poor start when Ross, in the middle of government negotiations, called Kenny a “political corpse”, a term he now acknowledges was “very hurtful”.“It’s the sort of phraseology I use in print. I’m really sorry if it hurt him, because I didn’t mean to hurt him at all. I thought it was just part and parcel of the political colour.”Varadkar’s relationship with the Independent Alliance has been easier, and Ross is a fan of his current boss.“When he came out, I thought it was fantastic. He did something really special in Irish public life. I suppose he’s kind of liberal, which is wonderful, and he has good attitude to politics.”Unsurprisingly, suggestions he has neglected his own transport brief for pet projects such as the Judicial Appointments Bill and constituency issues, such as the reopening of Stepaside Garda station, are rejected as a “myth”, and he points towards increased investment in transport infrastructure, as well as legislation on drink-driving and penalty points.Although he has been a lightning rod for criticism during the lifetime of the Government over the past four years, Ross has cut a more relaxed figure around Leinster House in recent months.SuccessesA number of successes on road traffic legislation, as well as his handling of the controversy surrounding the Football Association of Ireland, have restored his confidence.There have been rows within the alliance, however, but Ross says the four-member group easily overcome their “spats”. Others, however, question if the group gathered together by Ross before the last election will survive the coming campaign, and predict its members will go their own way once the Dáil is dissolved.Ross himself is looking forward to the contest, and says it may not even be his last."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4134328.1578518408!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"state to open its third consulate in china","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Irish Embassy in Beijing. The Department of Foreign Affairs is launching a strategy document  aimed at growing two-way trade between Ireland and the  Asia-Pacific region from €56 billion in 2018 to €100 billion by 2025The Government is to open a third consulate in China as part of a new diplomatic and trade strategy aimed at expanding the State’s presence in the Asia-Pacific region.On Thursday, the Department of Foreign Affairs is launching a strategy document – the first focused on growing the country’s presence in the region in more than 20 years – aimed at growing two-way trade between Ireland and the region from €56 billion in 2018 to €100 billion by 2025.There are already two consulates in China, in Shanghai and in Hong Kong, in addition to the Embassy in Beijing. The third consulate – the location of which has yet to be decided by the Government – will bring the number to 17 in the Asia-Pacific region.Guangzhou, China’s third largest city, and Shenzhen, a financial and shipping centre, are among the cities under consideration but no formal decision has been made on the location yet. The diplomatic push in the Far East is part of the Government’s “Global Ireland 2025” strategy to double the footprint of State offices and agencies around the globe. Southeast AsiaIreland’s new Embassy in the Philippines, announced in 2018, will open later this year in Manila, bringing to six the number of diplomatic missions in southeast Asia. The increased diplomatic presence is needed, according to the department, to serve the Irish community in the region which numbers an estimated 100,000. There are an estimated 50,000 citizens of Asia-Pacific countries living in Ireland. “Ireland suffers from a lack of visibility in Asia. We’re looking to raise this through public diplomacy and co-ordinated action across government,” says the department.Ten new diplomatic missions opened by the Government over the past two years cost €4.6 million in 2019. That includes €1.7 million in salaries and €1.2 million in office rental costs.Expanding into the wider Asia-Pacific region is intended to take advantage of closer trading relations between the EU and the region and to develop post-Brexit opportunities for the country given that the region has six of the 20 largest economies in the world.Main sectors“The strategy is the most significant effort by the Government to step up its relations with the region in over 20 years,” said the department. Among the main sectors being targeted for the increase in trade with the region are financial technology, agribusiness, education and tourism.The department is announcing a doubling in the number of working-holiday visas issued to Japanese students every year from 400 to 800.Efforts to enhance the country’s international profile coincides with the Government’s efforts to win a seat on the UN Security Council for the 2021-22 term in the June election this year.

Photograph: PresseyePA WireTalks to find a resolution between Sinn Féin and the DUP have continued at Stormont as the British and Irish governments sought to complete the text of an agreement to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly.While the two governments still hope to be in a position this week to publish their best estimate of what would constitute a “fair and balanced” deal to reinstate Stormont, sources said a number of areas of disagreement remain to be sorted.The main focus on Wednesday night was on the attempt by Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Northern Secretary Julian Smith to persuade the DUP and Sinn Féin to sign up to an agreement document.Around 7pm on Wednesday, negotiators from the SDLP, the Ulster Unionist Party and Alliance were advised to go home and return to the negotiations on Thursday while Mr Coveney and Mr Smith continued their discussions with the DUP and Sinn Féin.Despite the failure to achieve a breakthrough on Wednesday, Mr Coveney and Mr Smith still believed that a deal can be done that is acceptable to the parties.Sources said the key issues preventing an agreement revolve around the Irish language, ensuring the sustainability of any restored Executive and Assembly and proposed amendments to the petition of concern – the mechanism that allows motions to be vetoed even if they have majority support in the Assembly.The parties are also demanding a major cash injection to deal with matters such as the long-running heath crisis and underfunding of public services.Dublin and London sources said Mr Coveney and Mr Smith “will be working intensively late into the night again” at Stormont House.‘No major drama’Sources downplayed suggestions or speculation that the talks were in crisis. “There is genuinely no major drama but the slog is really, really slow here and everything is taking longer to conclude,” said one senior insider.He added that the talks would run past midnight and into the morning, and negotiations with all five parties would resume on Thursday.The North’s parties have only days to reach a deal if they are to meet Monday’s deadline set by Mr Smith. He said he will call fresh Assembly elections if there is no agreement.Wednesday’s negotiations were taking place against the backdrop of a further strike by nurses. About 9,000 members of the Royal College of Nursing walked out for 12 hours on Wednesday in a protest over pay and staffing levels, leading to the cancellation of 2,000 appointments. Further strikes are planned for Friday.British prime minister Boris Johnson urged the North’s politicians to reach a deal that would restore the Assembly. Speaking in the House of Commons, he said they should “take responsibility” and get the institutions up and running again.The North’s power-sharing government collapsed three years ago following a scandal over a renewable heating scheme, which led to the resignation of the late Sinn Féin Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness. There have been several attempts over the past three years to restore Stormont, but all have failed."},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"The US should take seriously Tehran\u0026rsquos efforts to put an end to the cycle of violenceUS president announces new sanctions, and confirms there were no American casualtiesAirline doubts crew or Boeing 737 to blame as disaster strikes amid US-Iran crisisTrump to address nation as Tehran says act \u0026lsquoconcluded\u0026rsquo response to Suleimani killingGen Qassem Suleimani led Iranian forces supporting Syrian president during civil warIran considering \u0026lsquoseveral scenarios\u0026rsquo to avenge death of Qassem Suleimani, killed in US drone strikeHardliners try to balance need to strike back at US with avoiding a full-blown conflictKhamenei weeps as Qassem Suleimani\u0026rsquos successor vows to expel US forces from regionTensions soar as Baghdad views any US role other than fighting Isis as reoccupationFallout continues after killing of top Iranian commander in US drone strike in BaghdadState TV says Iran will not respect any limits set down in pact on country\u0026rsquos nuclear plansIran\u0026rsquos militarist will not be forgotten and the US will not be forgiven for assassinating himHead of Iranian Revolutionary Guards\u0026rsquo elite Quds force, was killed in US strike on FridayTrump defends targeted strike on Suleimani amid threat of major confrontationPopular Mobilisation Forces claim attack hit convoy of medics north of BaghdadQassem Suleimani killed for \u0026lsquoplotting\u0026rsquo attacks on American diplomats and military personnelIraqi militia leaders on high alert, as US recalls citizens from BaghdadKilling of Iranian military commander certain to prompt wide-ranging repercussionsDonald Trump has taken his erratic presidency into treacherous territoryIsraeli PM\u0026rsquos move will delay corruption trial in the hope of an unlikely March election win"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Comment: Lack of emergency call from doomed Ukrainian jet in Iran suggests sudden and violent incidentDisclosure problems still exist in more than half of all prosecutions, review finds Patients are going blind because of long NHS delays, investigators warn  Universities which fail to deal with harassment and sexual misconduct could be fined up to £500,000Warnings over “postcode lottery” in ovarian cancer diagnosis and survivalMen should be given counselling over fertility struggles in Instagram world of \u0026#39perfect families\u0026#39Whirlpool urged to compensate families left using laundrettes because of dangerous washing machinesHouseholders could save millions in shake-up to make it easier to extend leases or buy freehold on their homesEU tells Boris Johnson: We cannot be close if you want to ergeTrump backs away from strikes saying Iran is \u0026#39standing down\u0026#39 after missile attackTop cleric urges supporters not to attack US as Donald Trump says regime has backed downComment: No scandals, no plots, no faults.

People are becoming wealthy at such speeds now.” As a result, the average age of buyers is down 13 years on a decade ago, when Mr Müller-Ötvös became head of the BMW-owned business.The British composer and member of the group the Beatles posing in his house\u0026#39s garage in Liverpool with his son in front of his psychedelic Rolls Royce The more youthful drivers are also opting to drive themselves the company believes just a quarter of its cars are chauffeured.Customers have been attracted to the manufacturer because of the opportunity to customise their car, limited only by imagination and legal requirements over vehicle design.Cars with million-pound price tags are now common at the Goodwood production plant in Chichester, West Sussex, Mr Müller-Ötvös said. Pundits say the one-off Sweptail built by Rolls-Royce in 2017 cost more than £10 million. Last year a new Rolls-Royce Phantom was commissioned by a Stockholm-based entrepreneur requesting a flower garden design on the inside, with one million stitches.Younger buyers have also been wooed by the company’s Black Badge line of modified cars, giving Rolls-Royce a newer, edgy image.Launched four years ago, high-performance Black Badge cars are aimed at what the firm calls a “subversive cohort who take risks, break rules and build success on their own terms”. It describes a Black Badge version of the Cullinan as its “darkest and most urban statement yet”.The change in tack is a far cry from John Lennon’s famous Rolls-Royce Phantom, currently owned by the Royal British Columbia Museum in Canada, which was sent to a specialist for a psychedelic paint job in the \u2028 Sixties.About a third of Rolls-Royce’s customers now visit the company’s base to oversee the personal touches.A new class of owner is also seeking out new models, such as the Cullinan 4x4, Rolls-Royce’s first SUV, which costs from £250,000.Mamadou Sakho with his family and Rolls RoyceNamed after the largest diamond ever found, the Cullinan accounted for 40 per cent of all its cars sold in 2019 – its first full year on the market.Eight out of 10 Cullinans have been bought by customers who had not previously owned a Rolls. “These are clients we have not seen before,” Mr Müller-Ötvös said. “Most already have other cars Cullinan is an addition to their garage.”SUVs have grown to be the biggest-selling car style in Europe, making up 40 per cent of the market. Rolls-Royce has been criticised for being late to the market. Yesterday rivals Bentley reported sales of its SUV, the Bentayga, were up 18 per cent.Mr Müller-Ötvös said: “This was a delicate exercise for the brand and we took our time. We were not late to the party – we arrived with it in full swing.” He added: “This is a British success story.

Me, my husband, and a righteous avenger for our troubled times. And if you haven’t guessed who that might be – then you don’t know Jack. Reacher that is. Jack Reacher. A Renaissance Man for all seasons, a 6ft 5in, 250lb taciturn anti-hero who has taught me everything I know about unarmed combat, ballistics and the swift execution of natural justice.His creator, multi-ultra-super bestseller Lee Child, has just caused a fit of the vapours in rarified publishing circles by joining the Booker Prize judging panel. Depending on whom you ask, it’s either the death knell for literary semiotics or the giddy hope of a winner we will actually read. In a single sitting.We met in late August last year, former high-flying military policeman Jack and I. A 2001 copy of Echo Burning was smouldering on a shelf in our rental cottage. I’d brought my own selection of reading, most notably Sue Prideaux’s well-received Nietzsche biography, I Am Dynamite. It turned out that what I craved was Reacher, not Nietzsche.I devoured that first 600-page doorstop like a starveling. I’ve now demolished all 24 novels and thus qualify as “a Reacher’s Creature”. Which is as big a surprise to me as to anyone else. I hate ultraviolence. I like orchidaceous language, laden with bon mots and embellished with modifiers.And yet. Don’t ask me how or why, but Reacher’s winning formula of short, blunt sentences is impossible to resist. That might sound like a criticism. Once upon a time, back when I was a literary snob who looked down on thrillers and dutifully ploughed through award-winning must-reads, it would have been. But not any more.Tom Cruise and Rosamund Pike star in the 2012 film adaptation of Jack Reacher “Guns were guns, either obtainable in time or not. Dixon wanted a Glock 19. Neagley’s hands were bigger, so she nominated a Glock 17. O’Donnell was a Beretta guy, by choice. Reacher didn’t care. He wasn’t planning on shooting anybody. He was planning on using his bare hands.”How hot is that? Very. He never killed a man who didn’t deserve it. He never kissed a woman who didn’t demand it. They tend to love him and leave him. He understands. No apology needed. And, refreshingly, he’s neither unhappily orced nor a high-functioning alcoholic. No alimony, no traumatic childhood, just a discerning taste in footwear. “His shoes were bench-made by a company called Cheaney, from Northampton in England. The style Reacher had chosen was called Tenterden, which was a brown semi-brogue made of heavy pebbled leather.”How can something so boring be so gripping? TBeats me. But it deserves some sort of award.On the subject of riveting reads, is anyone else conflicted about the National Trust’s new side gig, flogging second-hand books alongside the overpriced fudge and William Morris secateurs? Apparently it’s quite the little earner, Rodney. The charity is expected to make a tidy £1.8 million this year and it’s hard to argue with that.Hard, but not impossible I know that it’s entirely virtuous to reuse and recycle words as much as anything else, which is why business is booming for second-hand book retailers.But last time I looked, the National Trust was committed to saving ha‑has and Holbeins. A modest lunch at the average stately pile already costs a fortune. I resent further retail gavage being politely forced down my throat, when all I want is a spot of Grinling Gibbons with a side order of Capability Brown.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

We all know the fatalistic logic: the real power lies with the governments of countries such as China, or with the banks that fund the oil industry. What can you or I really achieve with our reusable coffee cups and vegan sausage rolls, other than occupying a rather smug patch of moral high ground, or worse still, creating a comforting illusion that masks the real problem?But there is another point of view. If we take the climate crisis seriously, how can we not want to try, even in some small way, to be part of the solution? Can we really expect the countries and companies that produce the most carbon to change if we don’t show willing to make some small sacrifice in our own lives? And if we all do something, won’t governments and corporations be encouraged to reflect the wishes of the people, even if they are motivated just by winning our votes and taking our money?I’ve sensed this urge to do something while speaking to colleagues recently. And it’s the desire to contribute that has prompted us to create this series of blogs, under the banner “20 Pledges for 2020”. It started on the Lifestyle desk. Did I know, asked one of our staff, that our deputy travel editor was going flight-free for a year? For someone who must receive more invitations for all-expenses-paid trips to the sun than anyone I can name, this was no casual commitment. Then I heard there was a colleague who’s going vegan, and another determined to switch to an electric car. And so the list went on.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe’re not immune to the bigger challenges and responsibilities of the media. During our recent coverage of the UK general election, we set out to make climate the most important theme for our coverage. Looking back, we led our site and our Daily Edition app on climate issues more than any other major British publisher over the same period – no small achievement – but I can’t say we managed to make it our number-one subject it was perhaps inevitable that the NHS and Brexit dominated the political agenda even on our pages. So one of the blogs you’ll see starting over the next few weeks will be from our politics team, pledging to hold politicians to account over the climate.As for me, I’ll be blogging about how The Independent can use its reach and influence to help fight the climate crisis. This was a challenge set for me directly by our environment columnist Donnachadh McCarthy, who is also part of the media team of Extinction Rebellion. I had always been confident that The Independent was not part of the problem. I’m proud to have worked here at the time when Michael McCarthy, our former environment editor, and the late Steve Connor, our science editor, helped to blaze a trail with their reporting and analysis. The natural world was not always such a fashionable cause back then, but you knew they were on to something from the level of pushback we received – even if sometimes it was impossible not to chuckle along.Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

It’s not like we’re The Independent, we can’t just stick a headline saying ‘Cruelty’ and then stick a picture of a dolphin or a whale underneath it. I mean, that’s just cheating, that’s rubbish.” (With apologies to real fans, I’ve filtered out the fruitier adjectives.) It’s amazing to think how recently such large parts of the media were sceptical towards “climate zealots”, and still are.But Donnachadh put a challenge to me a few months ago: when you look at the Indy, is it really clear that we’re living through a crisis? Couldn’t we be doing more? He was right, of course, and we will do more, so I’ll be blogging to keep you up to date with the changes we’re making.There are three phases to climate journalism as far as I can see. First, journalists had a job to do to convince sceptics that the science is right: mankind’s use of fossil fuels is heating our planet. Then there was the second phase: how fast was the world warming, can we limit the rise to 1.5 degrees, 3 degrees, or more? That’s still a crucial debate, and a subject we will continue to track. But the 20 Pledges blogs belong to a third phase: what exactly are we going to do about it – from government policy, financial regulation and international treaties to our own compromises and choices?Before someone helpfully points out the obvious, I realise that none of us writing these blogs is perfect. I’ll start by holding my hand up: for one thing, I fly from our London office to see our US-based staff, just as our reporters often take flights to report on stories around the world, so I’ll be writing more about that in a future blog post.But this project is not about pretending to be perfect, or virtue-signalling, or being diabolically hypocritical, and we certainly aren’t setting out to preach (there’s enough climate puritanism online already). If, or when, we slip up along the way – when the trip to review a new hotel is too tempting, if the smell of a bacon sandwich catches us at a moment of weakness – we’ll write about those times too. So what are we hoping for? We hope it gives us a richer perspective on some of the more important climate stories we cover in 2020, and that by sharing our own experiences we might encourage others to share theirs too. We’ll try to use our voice to encourage change from governments too.You may want to make a pledge yourself and write a blog through the year about it with us, in which case please do get in touch. You can email all of us writing these blogs at 20pledges@, and you’ll find all the blogs, running through the year, appearing at www.news20-pledges.Your pledge may not exactly change the world by itself, but if you share your story, you never know whose mind you might change along the way.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra’, says Will KirbyOut-and-out epiphanies are rare occurrences, but as I stood with my face deeply embedded in the armpit of a complete stranger in the early hours of the morning for the third time that week, I had the strangest feeling that I was, in fact, done with commuting on the Tube.There were other signs of course – like being kneecapped by the men in suits desperate to get onto the train before anyone has got off, or the passive-aggressive call to ‘move down please!’ at every stop as I consider how I could possibly make all 6ft of myself any smaller to allow for more space, or the unrecognisable smells that could honestly be anything from last night’s takeaway to this morning’s missed shower, or being late because of another series of red signals, or the 37 suitcases I had to negotiate because someone’s decided to move house, or looking at my bank balance and realising these joys are costing me more than £40 a week. I don’t know. But whatever it was, I realised then and there that I needed to find another way to get to work.\u0026nbspSo I did some investigating. A commute can make or break your day so it’s important to get it right. Walking was an option (healthy, free) but would have taken almost two hours each way, which would mean spending more than 12 hours a day either going from, to, or being at the office. I could jog, but, sadly, I hate jogging. The bus is doable, and a cheaper option than the Tube, but would involve three separate buses that aren’t very reliable. Which leaves me with one option. The bike.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven things no-one tells you when you start cycling to workInitially I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to join the fluorescent, Lyrca-clad hordes that zoom around the capital at breakneck speeds. I’d never really ridden a road bike before, let alone had an argument with a car or a bus about who’s on whose side of the road. How was I going to fit in if I’d never even owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses and didn’t really know what Strava was?! But it didn’t take long to realise that there are some massive benefits that outweigh any nerves or doubts about taking to the road on two wheels.Firstly, it’s healthy. Even a short cycle at the start and end of the day is exercise you probably wouldn’t otherwise have done, and it makes so much more sense to combine your fitness with your commute rather than trying to carve a slice out of your day to go to the gym. It also makes you feel good – if you take a look around the office first thing in the morning, it’s easy to spot the bright faces who’ve biked into work in amongst those who spent at least part of their morning under the ground.\u0026nbspIt is also better for the environment. Public transport, for its many faults (see above), is certainly greener than driving myself to work every morning, but there’s only so long you can tell yourself it doesn’t have a carbon footprint. Transport for London uses more electricity than anything else in the city, consuming enough power to fuel around 360,000 homes each year. By ditching my Oyster, I can hopefully shed with it that last ounce of green guilt.\u0026nbspWhy I\u0027ve pledged to go flight-free for a yearWhy I\u0027m going vegan for 2020This year I pledge to buy local and eat with the seasonsAnd I may as well do what I can to reduce pollution in the city where I live, even if it is on an inidual scale. A recent study found the capital’s poor air quality leads to around 1,000 hospital admissions for asthma and serious lung conditions every year, and another revealed that around four Londoners are hospitalised every day due to asthma caused by air pollution. Breathing London air is like smoking 160 cigarettes a year, according to the British Heart Foundation, and when you then consider that pollution on the Tube is around 15 times worse than above ground, it’s got to be a good idea to spend as little time down there as you can.\u0026nbspThe combination of a bit of light exercise and avoiding the toxic fumes that swirl around beneath the capital also reduces the chance of a heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. In fact, if the same number of trips were made by bike as they are in Denmark (26 per cent of all trips that are less than 5km), it could save the NHS a staggering £17 billion within 20 years.So, I’m going to give it a go. At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra. I’ll keep you posted.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s almost one a week. Let that sink in for a moment.It wasn’t done intentionally – but, perhaps even worse, completely obliviously. Every other weekend, off I trotted, to Moscow, Doha, Rome and the rest, usually for no more than a weekend at a time.

It never even crossed my mind that I needed to.\u0026nbspUntil, of course, a previously unimaginable and unprecedented shift in the public perception of flying started to emerge. The first time I really realised that a sea change was coming was Emma Thompson’s much-publicised fall from grace, when she flew 5,400 miles from LA to London in the spring to participate in the Extinction Rebellion demonstrations that were bringing the capital to a standstill. The actor and activist was pilloried by the Right and Left in equal measure (the former labelling her a hypocrite, the latter asserting they didn’t need her carbon-tainted help, thank you very much).Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

What was the big deal? She was using her platform to add clout to a much-needed protest demanding action on the coming climate crisis. Surely that was a good thing?It wasn’t long afterwards that I heard of the flygskam (flight shame) and tågskryt (train brag) movements for the first time. Originating in Sweden and publicised by high-profile figures including Olympic athlete Bjorn Ferry and opera singer Malena Ernman, mother of teenage activist Greta Thunberg, the idea was to make the notion of flying something a little unsavoury – something you might not want to admit to doing in polite company. On the flip side, the “train brag” movement is all about celebrating rail travel, with participants posting pictures and videos of their beauty-filled overland journeys on social media.Meet the people who’ve given up flyingThe concept has even made its way over the North Sea, as I discovered when I came across the Flight Free UK movement. Founder Anna Hughes’ original aim was to get 100,000 people to sign up and pledge to stay grounded for a whole year.\u0026nbsp“I haven’t flown for about 10 years,” she said, “but given the situation we’re now in, I felt like it wasn’t enough to reduce my own carbon footprint – I needed to open it up and do more. And it took over my life!”I didn’t really expect to be joining the swelling ranks of do-gooders, to be perfectly honest. As journalists, we can easily become accomplished fantasists, convincing ourselves that we are somehow set apart from reality – here to observe and report, rather than participate.But something changed in me after I spoke to Anna, along with a number of other committed non-flyers. They were, to a fault, impassioned and persuasive yet polite and non-judgemental. They were happy to take on huge personal expense and inconvenience, all in the hopes that it might help save the only habitable planet we’ve got. A seed was planted in my brain which grew – slowly but unstoppably – day by day, and has already led to me significantly cutting down on the number\u0026nbspof flights I took in the latter half of 2019.Now, it’s time to take the next step: a year of keeping both feet on the ground. Far from being some po-faced exercise in restraint, more than anything I hope this experience will prove that travel, in all its adventurous, erse and mind-opening glory, is not only possible with clipped wings, but can even be enhanced by taking it slow.I produced somewhere in the region of 6,000kg of CO2 from flying in 2019. Here’s to it being 0kg in 2020.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He warned that many assets were at risk of being rendered “worthless” by the climate crisis.Under Mr Carney’s leadership, the Bank recently announced plans to conduct “stress tests” designed to forecast how well financial firms would cope with various future climate change scenarios. Those that fail to pass the tests could be required to hold more capital or get rid of assets.Barclays has made itself a climate pariah. Time for a boycottJeanne Martin, campaign manager at ShareAction, which organised the shareholder resolution, said: “The message is clear. Piecemeal changes in energy policy will no longer cut it.\u0026nbsp“For too long, minor policy improvements have provided cover for the banking sector, while failing to halt fossil fuel financing.\u0026nbsp“We know what needs to happen. Banks must align their lending with the science. If Barclays supports the Paris Agreement, it will support this resolution.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it is likely to face unwelcome publicity and growing pressure to change tack.Other European banks have begun to take steps to align with the Paris Agreement. In June, French lender Crédit Agricole committed to fully phase out its exposure to the coal industry by 2030 for EU and OECD countries 2040 for China 2050 for the rest of the world. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Youth Strike for Climate: London protest in photos Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.BNP Paribas committed in 2017 to no longer do business with companies focused on oil and gas from tar sands, one of the most damaging forms of fossil fuel extraction.\u0026nbspThe bank will also no longer finance projects that are mainly involved in the transportation and export of oil and gas from tar sands.\u0026nbspLaura Chappell, chief executive of Brunel Pension Partnership, which is backing the Barclays resolution, said: “Brunel Pension Partnership Limited believes climate change poses significant risks to global financial stability and could thereby create climate-related financial risks to our own business operations, portfolios and client partner funds, unless action is taken to mitigate these risks.” \u0026nbsp“The lending practices of many banks poses a serious threat to the goals to the Paris agreement. As such, we welcome ShareAction’s call to the world’s largest banks to integrate climate change risk assessment and to set and disclose adequate phase-out targets in response. We hope the Barclays Board formally supports this resolution.”A spokesperson for Barclays said: “We are working to help tackle climate change, and we meet with Share Action and other shareholders regularly to update them on our progress.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Experts say some have\u0026nbspindulged in greenwashingAmid all the doom and gloom, here’s something positive: Hargreaves Lansdown, the investment firm, found that two thirds of people who watched the BBC’s Blue Planet have changed the way they live because of the environmental programme when it conducted a survey earlier this year.David Attenborough’s documentary focused on the impact humans are having on the planet – drawing particular attention to climate change and plastic waste.\u0026nbspHowever, despite the programme’s welcome impact, and the fact that ethical funds have been around for a while, there was a sting in the tail.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He warned that many assets were at risk of being rendered “worthless” by the climate crisis.Under Mr Carney’s leadership, the Bank recently announced plans to conduct “stress tests” designed to forecast how well financial firms would cope with various future climate change scenarios. Those that fail to pass the tests could be required to hold more capital or get rid of assets.Barclays has made itself a climate pariah. Time for a boycottJeanne Martin, campaign manager at ShareAction, which organised the shareholder resolution, said: “The message is clear. Piecemeal changes in energy policy will no longer cut it.\u0026nbsp“For too long, minor policy improvements have provided cover for the banking sector, while failing to halt fossil fuel financing.\u0026nbsp“We know what needs to happen. Banks must align their lending with the science. If Barclays supports the Paris Agreement, it will support this resolution.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it is likely to face unwelcome publicity and growing pressure to change tack.Other European banks have begun to take steps to align with the Paris Agreement. In June, French lender Crédit Agricole committed to fully phase out its exposure to the coal industry by 2030 for EU and OECD countries 2040 for China 2050 for the rest of the world. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Youth Strike for Climate: London protest in photos Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.BNP Paribas committed in 2017 to no longer do business with companies focused on oil and gas from tar sands, one of the most damaging forms of fossil fuel extraction.\u0026nbspThe bank will also no longer finance projects that are mainly involved in the transportation and export of oil and gas from tar sands.\u0026nbspLaura Chappell, chief executive of Brunel Pension Partnership, which is backing the Barclays resolution, said: “Brunel Pension Partnership Limited believes climate change poses significant risks to global financial stability and could thereby create climate-related financial risks to our own business operations, portfolios and client partner funds, unless action is taken to mitigate these risks.” \u0026nbsp“The lending practices of many banks poses a serious threat to the goals to the Paris agreement. As such, we welcome ShareAction’s call to the world’s largest banks to integrate climate change risk assessment and to set and disclose adequate phase-out targets in response. We hope the Barclays Board formally supports this resolution.”A spokesperson for Barclays said: “We are working to help tackle climate change, and we meet with Share Action and other shareholders regularly to update them on our progress.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A lively debate on social media, which included Piers Morgan labelling the bakery chain “PC-ravaged clowns”, ensured the new product was a hit.\u0026nbspGreggs\u0026nbspwill no doubt be hoping that the new meat-free steak bake, launched last week, also becomes a customer favourite.While\u0026nbspthe vegan launches have generated huge interest from consumers, Greggs’\u0026nbspfortunes have been buoyed by a broader strategy of transforming itself from a traditional bakery into a more modern food-to-go chain, offering a range of products including salads and coffee.Like-for-like sales jumped 9.2 per cent in 2019, Greggs revealed\u0026nbspas it upgraded its profit guidance for the third time in two months. The announcement comes after shareholders banked a £35m special idend in October thanks to the company’s better-than-expected performance.We tested Gregg’s new vegan steak bake and this is what it’s likeUnderlying pre-tax profit for the year will still be ahead of expectations\u0026nbspeven after the £7m staff bonus, Greggs said.“I am delighted to announce that we will also be making a special additional payment to all of our colleagues across the business who have worked so hard to deliver this success in what has been a phenomenal year,” chief executive Roger Whiteside said on Wednesday.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Words by Stacey Smith213 ‘Rachel Ama’s Vegan Eats: Tasty plant-based recipes for every day’ by Rachel Ama. Published by Ebury Press: £12.87, AmazonSince launching her vegan YouTube channel in 2017, Rachel has gained a heap of hungry followers who lap up her simple, delicious recipes (and the dance moves that go along with them). Dishes are often one-pot, can be prepped ahead, and most include a song recommendation so you can dance along as you cook. Within these pages, you’ll find plenty of meals inspired by Ama’s Caribbean and West African roots – from crispy jerk barbecue tacos or ackee “saltfish” with dumplings to peanut stew. Although this is really a celebration of all cultures – and with vegan takes on everything from Thai green curry to creamy cashew and vegetable no-pasta lasagne, we’re pretty confident you’ll find your favourite comfort dish has been given a plant-based makeover. With most ingredients easy to obtain and meals quick to put together, this is modern cooking, for the meat-shunning millennial. 313 ‘BOSH! Healthy Vegan’ by Henry Firth \u0026amp Ian Theasby. Published by HQ: £10.87, AmazonWorking with a registered dietician to ensure recipes follow trusted NHS guidelines, the BOSH! boys (aka, Henry and Ian) have bought us their healthiest cookbook to date. Recognising that just because a plate of food is vegan, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthy (vegan junk food certainly exists!), this is a collection of 80 new recipes showcasing their flavoursome vegan food with a healthier focus. Along with advice on sleep, movement and relaxing, there’s guidance on ensuring you get all the nutrients you need. And although the boys insist this isn’t a diet book, you’ll find recipes to help you reduce fat, build muscle and generally be a bit healthier. So whether you’re looking to up your protein intake (try the ultimate veg tacos), reduce your sugar intake with a summer-berry granola bowl or keep your calorie intake to under 500 per portion with puttanesca potato stew, you should be left feeling suitably inspired to kick start the new year.413 ‘Happy Vegan: Easy plant-based recipes to make the whole family happy’ by Fearne Cotton. Published by Seven Dials: £13.46, AmazonDespite Fearne Cotton not being a fully-fledged vegan herself (or perhaps because), this book got rave reviews from our panel, with both flexitarians, meat-eaters and vegans alike. Recipes are approachable, inexpensive and perfect for the whole family, so we can see ourselves working through them all in time. The broccoli katsu curry was a particular favourite and surprisingly easy to make and for tea time we’ll be trying our hand at her date and almond cake with caramel sauce which uses white miso paste and coconut cream to great effect.513 ‘Vegan One Pound Meals: Delicious budget-friendly plant-based recipes all for £1 per person’ by Miguel Barclay. Published by Headline Home: £10.75, AmazonIf ever there’s a time we feel the pinch, it’s January, with the festivities of Christmas long behind us but the credit card still to pay. Thankfully eating a plant-based diet could be the answer and in this book, you’ll find over 85 recipes all coming in at a frankly unbelievable £1 a portion. Our concerns that we’d be living off of beans on toast were quickly alleviated as we tucked into black bean meatballs and sticky aubergine bao. Full-flavoured, quick and easy, we couldn’t really ask for more.613 ‘Incredible Plant-Based Desserts: Colorful Vegan Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, and other Epic Delights’ by Anthea Cheng. Published by Quarry Books: £11.89, AmazonCalling all sweet-tooths! This collection of recipes from Australian blogger Anthea Cheng is celebratory food for the keen baker. You certainly couldn’t call dried rainbow pear slices convenient, quick or easy to make, however the impact they have when used to decorate her chai cake is truly show-stopping. If that all sounds a little intimidating, we found the Snack Time chapter much more manageable, with the likes of bliss balls, chocolate cups and cookies vying for attention, as well as Instagrammable breakfast bowls, beautifully presented with nut butters, granola and oats.713 ‘Dirty Vegan Another Bite’ by Matt Pritchard, published by Octopus Books: £20, Octopus BooksAfter 10 years of hard partying finally caught up with him, Matt decided to switch from the crazy pranks of MTV’s Dirty Sanchez to fitness – and is now a completely vegan endurance athlete. Believing a natural diet is key, Matt’s second cookbook is brimming with recipes full of veggies and largely focuses on un-processed ingredients (keeping the vegan cheese or meat-substitutes to a minimum). Some of Pritchard’s favourites include roasting tin laksa, sticky tofu bao buns and rhubarb and custard doughnuts. If you’re yet to convince your pal\u0027s that veganism is the way forward, we reckon the Dinner with Mates chapter will convert a few of them, with all the recipes you need to create a Mexican feast, a perfect picnic, a banging BBQ or a cracking Christmas spread. All in all we found recipes really varied, with us ear-marking nearly all of them to try at once.813 ‘5 Ingredient Vegan’ by Katy Beskow. Published by Quadrille: £12.08, AmazonLet’s face it, at the end of a long day the last thing any of us want to be doing – whether we’re following a plant-based diet or not – is trying to track down long lists of hard to find ingredients. This is the fourth book from the award-winning cook, writer and cookery tutor Katy Beskow and follows a similar simplified format, with each recipe requiring just five ingredients. Chapters include soups, lunches suppers, sweets and basics, with recipes beautifully laid out and gorgeous photography accompanying each one. Far from being basic, we were amazed to see we could create a beautiful Mediterranean briam (a layered courgette, potato and red onion bake from Greece) which was as delicious hot with crusty bread as it was cold for lunch the next day.913 ‘Zaika: Vegan recipes from India’ by Romy Gill. Published by Seven Dials : £10, AmazonGrowing up in a small town in West Bengal, India, very few people, including Romy Gill’s own family, ate meat regularly. It’s this home-cooked vegan food of her childhood that the chef and food writer wanted to share with us through her debut cookbook Zaika – meaning taste, or flavour. There’s an entire section dedicated to bread, including gram flour turmeric pancakes which are perfect with chutneys, a variety of rotis and parathas and light naan bread with nigella seeds. The Light \u0026amp Breezy chapter is all about showcasing the freshest ingredients – think watermelon and mint salad while the Warming the Heart chapter is where you’ll find hearty comfort food such as spicy red lentil dahl. The section we most fell for though was Labours of Love for when you’ve got time to really get lost in the kitchen – rich, creamy and so warming, we recommend the Baingan masala with baby aubergines, dill and coconut.1013 ‘Rebel Recipes: Maximum flavour, minimum fuss: the ultimate in vegan food’ by Niki Webster. Published by Bloomsbury: £18, AmazonThe debut book from award-winning blogger and food consultant Nikki Webster shares the same ethos as her blog Rebel Recipes – that healthy food needn’t be boring or lacking in flavour. Taking inspiration from around the globe, you could never accuse these recipes of being dull. If only we could start every day with creamy spiced coconut porridge and sticky sesame banana! Instead of relying on stale vegan ingredients and recipes – this is new-school vegan cuisine for those seeking full flavours. Although despite this, recipes were easy to follow and largely uncomplicated – with lots of spicy curries, pulses, flatbreads, salads, dips and pickles making an appearance. With mouth-watering photography throughout, the Can’t Believe It’s Vegan Desserts chapter is a particular highlight, with the likes of chocolate ganache tart, easy espresso martini pots and lemon curd and thyme tart. 1113 ‘Green: Veggie and vegan meals for no-fuss weeks and relaxed weekends’ by Elly Pear (Curshen). Published by Ebury Press: £14.99, AmazonWhile this title isn’t 100 per cent vegan, half of the book is made up of plant-based recipes so we felt it was still well worth including. Acknowledging that most of us have more time to experiment in the kitchen at the weekend yet need dinner on the table pronto mid-week, Elly Pear’s book separates dishes accordingly. We’re very keen to incorporate more Sunday night batch-cooking into our weekly routine, in order to eat better later in the week and with tray bakes, one-pot wonders and freeze-able options, this will keep us suitably inspired.1213 ‘Vegan (ish): 100 simple, budget recipes that don\u0027t cost the earth’ by Jack Monroe. Published by Bluebird: £10.66, AmazonDon’t be fooled by the title, every one of the 100 recipes within this book is completely vegan. The “ish” comes from Jack Monroe’s belief that if we were all to incorporate a few more plant-based meals into our diet each week, we’d be better off both environmentally and financially. So you needn’t be a full-time vegan to appreciate the practical, inexpensive solutions within this book. Although perhaps not the sexiest food chapter to ever be written – the whole section on sandwiches was inherently helpful for midweek meal inspiration (especially when you consider the “standard” fillings of cheese, ham, tuna, etc obviously aren’t vegan). In true Jack Monroe style, we loved the no-nonsense, easy to follow recipes and believe we’ll turn to this cookbook on a regular basis. 1313 ‘7 Day Vegan Challenge’ by Bettina Campolucci-Bordi. Published by Hardie Grant: £9.72, WorderyIf you’re tempted to give this vegan thing a whirl but you really don’t know where to start, the 7 Day Vegan Challenge is here to help. There are three menu plans to choose from complete with shopping lists: The Easy Peasy Way (quick meals for those that don’t mind repeating some dishes), For the Planners (which requires a Sunday night batch-cooking session) and Fast \u0026amp Fresh (quick and simple recipes). So a typical weekday might look like, banoffee oats for breakfast, a convincing vegan take on the classic BLT sandwich for lunch and creamy satay noodles with salt and pepper fried tofu for tea.Veganuary becomes bigger every year, but it needn\u0027t be just for Janaury as these cookbooks make it easy and accessible. Words by Stacey Smith213 ‘Rachel Ama’s Vegan Eats: Tasty plant-based recipes for every day’ by Rachel Ama. Published by Ebury Press: £12.87, AmazonSince launching her vegan YouTube channel in 2017, Rachel has gained a heap of hungry followers who lap up her simple, delicious recipes (and the dance moves that go along with them). Dishes are often one-pot, can be prepped ahead, and most include a song recommendation so you can dance along as you cook. Within these pages, you’ll find plenty of meals inspired by Ama’s Caribbean and West African roots – from crispy jerk barbecue tacos or ackee “saltfish” with dumplings to peanut stew. Although this is really a celebration of all cultures – and with vegan takes on everything from Thai green curry to creamy cashew and vegetable no-pasta lasagne, we’re pretty confident you’ll find your favourite comfort dish has been given a plant-based makeover. With most ingredients easy to obtain and meals quick to put together, this is modern cooking, for the meat-shunning millennial. 313 ‘BOSH! Healthy Vegan’ by Henry Firth \u0026amp Ian Theasby. Published by HQ: £10.87, AmazonWorking with a registered dietician to ensure recipes follow trusted NHS guidelines, the BOSH! boys (aka, Henry and Ian) have bought us their healthiest cookbook to date. Recognising that just because a plate of food is vegan, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthy (vegan junk food certainly exists!), this is a collection of 80 new recipes showcasing their flavoursome vegan food with a healthier focus. Along with advice on sleep, movement and relaxing, there’s guidance on ensuring you get all the nutrients you need. And although the boys insist this isn’t a diet book, you’ll find recipes to help you reduce fat, build muscle and generally be a bit healthier. So whether you’re looking to up your protein intake (try the ultimate veg tacos), reduce your sugar intake with a summer-berry granola bowl or keep your calorie intake to under 500 per portion with puttanesca potato stew, you should be left feeling suitably inspired to kick start the new year.413 ‘Happy Vegan: Easy plant-based recipes to make the whole family happy’ by Fearne Cotton. Published by Seven Dials: £13.46, AmazonDespite Fearne Cotton not being a fully-fledged vegan herself (or perhaps because), this book got rave reviews from our panel, with both flexitarians, meat-eaters and vegans alike. Recipes are approachable, inexpensive and perfect for the whole family, so we can see ourselves working through them all in time. The broccoli katsu curry was a particular favourite and surprisingly easy to make and for tea time we’ll be trying our hand at her date and almond cake with caramel sauce which uses white miso paste and coconut cream to great effect.513 ‘Vegan One Pound Meals: Delicious budget-friendly plant-based recipes all for £1 per person’ by Miguel Barclay. Published by Headline Home: £10.75, AmazonIf ever there’s a time we feel the pinch, it’s January, with the festivities of Christmas long behind us but the credit card still to pay. Thankfully eating a plant-based diet could be the answer and in this book, you’ll find over 85 recipes all coming in at a frankly unbelievable £1 a portion. Our concerns that we’d be living off of beans on toast were quickly alleviated as we tucked into black bean meatballs and sticky aubergine bao. Full-flavoured, quick and easy, we couldn’t really ask for more.613 ‘Incredible Plant-Based Desserts: Colorful Vegan Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, and other Epic Delights’ by Anthea Cheng. Published by Quarry Books: £11.89, AmazonCalling all sweet-tooths! This collection of recipes from Australian blogger Anthea Cheng is celebratory food for the keen baker. You certainly couldn’t call dried rainbow pear slices convenient, quick or easy to make, however the impact they have when used to decorate her chai cake is truly show-stopping. If that all sounds a little intimidating, we found the Snack Time chapter much more manageable, with the likes of bliss balls, chocolate cups and cookies vying for attention, as well as Instagrammable breakfast bowls, beautifully presented with nut butters, granola and oats.713 ‘Dirty Vegan Another Bite’ by Matt Pritchard, published by Octopus Books: £20, Octopus BooksAfter 10 years of hard partying finally caught up with him, Matt decided to switch from the crazy pranks of MTV’s Dirty Sanchez to fitness – and is now a completely vegan endurance athlete. Believing a natural diet is key, Matt’s second cookbook is brimming with recipes full of veggies and largely focuses on un-processed ingredients (keeping the vegan cheese or meat-substitutes to a minimum). Some of Pritchard’s favourites include roasting tin laksa, sticky tofu bao buns and rhubarb and custard doughnuts. If you’re yet to convince your pal\u0027s that veganism is the way forward, we reckon the Dinner with Mates chapter will convert a few of them, with all the recipes you need to create a Mexican feast, a perfect picnic, a banging BBQ or a cracking Christmas spread. All in all we found recipes really varied, with us ear-marking nearly all of them to try at once.813 ‘5 Ingredient Vegan’ by Katy Beskow. Published by Quadrille: £12.08, AmazonLet’s face it, at the end of a long day the last thing any of us want to be doing – whether we’re following a plant-based diet or not – is trying to track down long lists of hard to find ingredients. This is the fourth book from the award-winning cook, writer and cookery tutor Katy Beskow and follows a similar simplified format, with each recipe requiring just five ingredients. Chapters include soups, lunches suppers, sweets and basics, with recipes beautifully laid out and gorgeous photography accompanying each one. Far from being basic, we were amazed to see we could create a beautiful Mediterranean briam (a layered courgette, potato and red onion bake from Greece) which was as delicious hot with crusty bread as it was cold for lunch the next day.913 ‘Zaika: Vegan recipes from India’ by Romy Gill. Published by Seven Dials : £10, AmazonGrowing up in a small town in West Bengal, India, very few people, including Romy Gill’s own family, ate meat regularly. It’s this home-cooked vegan food of her childhood that the chef and food writer wanted to share with us through her debut cookbook Zaika – meaning taste, or flavour. There’s an entire section dedicated to bread, including gram flour turmeric pancakes which are perfect with chutneys, a variety of rotis and parathas and light naan bread with nigella seeds.

This was the largest increase since February 2018, and up from 2.1 per cent in November.”Mr Archer added: “It is possible that house prices got a boost in November and December from some buyers keen to get their move done before the general election to avoid any shocks or uncertainties that could arise.”However, he warned: “It should also be borne in mind that the Halifax measure tends to give higher house price readings than other measures.”House prices slump to seven-year low“Looking ahead, we expect uncertainty in the economy to ease somewhat in 2020, which should see transaction volumes increase and further price growth made possible by an improvement in households\u0027 real incomes.“Longer-term issues, such as the shortage of homes for sale and low levels of house-building, will continue to limit supply, while the ongoing challenges faced by prospective buyers in raising deposits will serve to constrain demand.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is because they are treated favourably and have more privileges,” the Ofsted report said. “Some of the girls told us that they do not like this. They said that this was not fair and feel disadvantaged.”Inspectors visited the school in November and concluded its unlawful segregation of pupils by sex is having a “negative impact” on girls’ education and self-confidence.It comes after the Court of Appeal concluded in 2017 that an Islamic faith school’s policy of segregating boys from girls was unlawful sex discrimination.Ofsted had placed the mixed-sex Al-Hijrah school in Birmingham into special measures in 2016 after it claimed iding classes was discriminatory.Saadat Rasool, headteacher of\u0026nbspRedstone\u0026nbspAcademy, has said it has no intention of defying the law in any way.He said: “We believe the idea that boys are ‘given favourable treatment and more opportunities than girls’ is just not accurate as all the previous Ofsted reports have noted that provision for boys and girls has been equal and fair.“We work very diligently to offer the best to both boys and girls at our school – and both are given equal opportunities to be successful in whatever they choose.”​Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A lively debate on social media, which included Piers Morgan labelling the bakery chain “PC-ravaged clowns”, ensured the new product was a hit.\u0026nbspGreggs\u0026nbspwill no doubt be hoping that the new meat-free steak bake, launched last week, also becomes a customer favourite.While\u0026nbspthe vegan launches have generated huge interest from consumers, Greggs’\u0026nbspfortunes have been buoyed by a broader strategy of transforming itself from a traditional bakery into a more modern food-to-go chain, offering a range of products including salads and coffee.Like-for-like sales jumped 9.2 per cent in 2019, Greggs revealed\u0026nbspas it upgraded its profit guidance for the third time in two months.

Words by Stacey Smith213 ‘Rachel Ama’s Vegan Eats: Tasty plant-based recipes for every day’ by Rachel Ama. Published by Ebury Press: £12.87, AmazonSince launching her vegan YouTube channel in 2017, Rachel has gained a heap of hungry followers who lap up her simple, delicious recipes (and the dance moves that go along with them). Dishes are often one-pot, can be prepped ahead, and most include a song recommendation so you can dance along as you cook. Within these pages, you’ll find plenty of meals inspired by Ama’s Caribbean and West African roots – from crispy jerk barbecue tacos or ackee “saltfish” with dumplings to peanut stew. Although this is really a celebration of all cultures – and with vegan takes on everything from Thai green curry to creamy cashew and vegetable no-pasta lasagne, we’re pretty confident you’ll find your favourite comfort dish has been given a plant-based makeover. With most ingredients easy to obtain and meals quick to put together, this is modern cooking, for the meat-shunning millennial. 313 ‘BOSH! Healthy Vegan’ by Henry Firth \u0026amp Ian Theasby. Published by HQ: £10.87, AmazonWorking with a registered dietician to ensure recipes follow trusted NHS guidelines, the BOSH! boys (aka, Henry and Ian) have bought us their healthiest cookbook to date. Recognising that just because a plate of food is vegan, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthy (vegan junk food certainly exists!), this is a collection of 80 new recipes showcasing their flavoursome vegan food with a healthier focus. Along with advice on sleep, movement and relaxing, there’s guidance on ensuring you get all the nutrients you need. And although the boys insist this isn’t a diet book, you’ll find recipes to help you reduce fat, build muscle and generally be a bit healthier. So whether you’re looking to up your protein intake (try the ultimate veg tacos), reduce your sugar intake with a summer-berry granola bowl or keep your calorie intake to under 500 per portion with puttanesca potato stew, you should be left feeling suitably inspired to kick start the new year.413 ‘Happy Vegan: Easy plant-based recipes to make the whole family happy’ by Fearne Cotton. Published by Seven Dials: £13.46, AmazonDespite Fearne Cotton not being a fully-fledged vegan herself (or perhaps because), this book got rave reviews from our panel, with both flexitarians, meat-eaters and vegans alike. Recipes are approachable, inexpensive and perfect for the whole family, so we can see ourselves working through them all in time. The broccoli katsu curry was a particular favourite and surprisingly easy to make and for tea time we’ll be trying our hand at her date and almond cake with caramel sauce which uses white miso paste and coconut cream to great effect.513 ‘Vegan One Pound Meals: Delicious budget-friendly plant-based recipes all for £1 per person’ by Miguel Barclay. Published by Headline Home: £10.75, AmazonIf ever there’s a time we feel the pinch, it’s January, with the festivities of Christmas long behind us but the credit card still to pay. Thankfully eating a plant-based diet could be the answer and in this book, you’ll find over 85 recipes all coming in at a frankly unbelievable £1 a portion. Our concerns that we’d be living off of beans on toast were quickly alleviated as we tucked into black bean meatballs and sticky aubergine bao. Full-flavoured, quick and easy, we couldn’t really ask for more.613 ‘Incredible Plant-Based Desserts: Colorful Vegan Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, and other Epic Delights’ by Anthea Cheng. Published by Quarry Books: £11.89, AmazonCalling all sweet-tooths! This collection of recipes from Australian blogger Anthea Cheng is celebratory food for the keen baker. You certainly couldn’t call dried rainbow pear slices convenient, quick or easy to make, however the impact they have when used to decorate her chai cake is truly show-stopping. If that all sounds a little intimidating, we found the Snack Time chapter much more manageable, with the likes of bliss balls, chocolate cups and cookies vying for attention, as well as Instagrammable breakfast bowls, beautifully presented with nut butters, granola and oats.713 ‘Dirty Vegan Another Bite’ by Matt Pritchard, published by Octopus Books: £20, Octopus BooksAfter 10 years of hard partying finally caught up with him, Matt decided to switch from the crazy pranks of MTV’s Dirty Sanchez to fitness – and is now a completely vegan endurance athlete. Believing a natural diet is key, Matt’s second cookbook is brimming with recipes full of veggies and largely focuses on un-processed ingredients (keeping the vegan cheese or meat-substitutes to a minimum). Some of Pritchard’s favourites include roasting tin laksa, sticky tofu bao buns and rhubarb and custard doughnuts. If you’re yet to convince your pal\u0027s that veganism is the way forward, we reckon the Dinner with Mates chapter will convert a few of them, with all the recipes you need to create a Mexican feast, a perfect picnic, a banging BBQ or a cracking Christmas spread. All in all we found recipes really varied, with us ear-marking nearly all of them to try at once.813 ‘5 Ingredient Vegan’ by Katy Beskow. Published by Quadrille: £12.08, AmazonLet’s face it, at the end of a long day the last thing any of us want to be doing – whether we’re following a plant-based diet or not – is trying to track down long lists of hard to find ingredients. This is the fourth book from the award-winning cook, writer and cookery tutor Katy Beskow and follows a similar simplified format, with each recipe requiring just five ingredients. Chapters include soups, lunches suppers, sweets and basics, with recipes beautifully laid out and gorgeous photography accompanying each one. Far from being basic, we were amazed to see we could create a beautiful Mediterranean briam (a layered courgette, potato and red onion bake from Greece) which was as delicious hot with crusty bread as it was cold for lunch the next day.913 ‘Zaika: Vegan recipes from India’ by Romy Gill. Published by Seven Dials : £10, AmazonGrowing up in a small town in West Bengal, India, very few people, including Romy Gill’s own family, ate meat regularly. It’s this home-cooked vegan food of her childhood that the chef and food writer wanted to share with us through her debut cookbook Zaika – meaning taste, or flavour. There’s an entire section dedicated to bread, including gram flour turmeric pancakes which are perfect with chutneys, a variety of rotis and parathas and light naan bread with nigella seeds. The Light \u0026amp Breezy chapter is all about showcasing the freshest ingredients – think watermelon and mint salad while the Warming the Heart chapter is where you’ll find hearty comfort food such as spicy red lentil dahl. The section we most fell for though was Labours of Love for when you’ve got time to really get lost in the kitchen – rich, creamy and so warming, we recommend the Baingan masala with baby aubergines, dill and coconut.1013 ‘Rebel Recipes: Maximum flavour, minimum fuss: the ultimate in vegan food’ by Niki Webster. Published by Bloomsbury: £18, AmazonThe debut book from award-winning blogger and food consultant Nikki Webster shares the same ethos as her blog Rebel Recipes – that healthy food needn’t be boring or lacking in flavour. Taking inspiration from around the globe, you could never accuse these recipes of being dull. If only we could start every day with creamy spiced coconut porridge and sticky sesame banana! Instead of relying on stale vegan ingredients and recipes – this is new-school vegan cuisine for those seeking full flavours. Although despite this, recipes were easy to follow and largely uncomplicated – with lots of spicy curries, pulses, flatbreads, salads, dips and pickles making an appearance. With mouth-watering photography throughout, the Can’t Believe It’s Vegan Desserts chapter is a particular highlight, with the likes of chocolate ganache tart, easy espresso martini pots and lemon curd and thyme tart. 1113 ‘Green: Veggie and vegan meals for no-fuss weeks and relaxed weekends’ by Elly Pear (Curshen). Published by Ebury Press: £14.99, AmazonWhile this title isn’t 100 per cent vegan, half of the book is made up of plant-based recipes so we felt it was still well worth including. Acknowledging that most of us have more time to experiment in the kitchen at the weekend yet need dinner on the table pronto mid-week, Elly Pear’s book separates dishes accordingly. We’re very keen to incorporate more Sunday night batch-cooking into our weekly routine, in order to eat better later in the week and with tray bakes, one-pot wonders and freeze-able options, this will keep us suitably inspired.1213 ‘Vegan (ish): 100 simple, budget recipes that don\u0027t cost the earth’ by Jack Monroe. Published by Bluebird: £10.66, AmazonDon’t be fooled by the title, every one of the 100 recipes within this book is completely vegan. The “ish” comes from Jack Monroe’s belief that if we were all to incorporate a few more plant-based meals into our diet each week, we’d be better off both environmentally and financially. So you needn’t be a full-time vegan to appreciate the practical, inexpensive solutions within this book. Although perhaps not the sexiest food chapter to ever be written – the whole section on sandwiches was inherently helpful for midweek meal inspiration (especially when you consider the “standard” fillings of cheese, ham, tuna, etc obviously aren’t vegan). In true Jack Monroe style, we loved the no-nonsense, easy to follow recipes and believe we’ll turn to this cookbook on a regular basis. 1313 ‘7 Day Vegan Challenge’ by Bettina Campolucci-Bordi. Published by Hardie Grant: £9.72, WorderyIf you’re tempted to give this vegan thing a whirl but you really don’t know where to start, the 7 Day Vegan Challenge is here to help. There are three menu plans to choose from complete with shopping lists: The Easy Peasy Way (quick meals for those that don’t mind repeating some dishes), For the Planners (which requires a Sunday night batch-cooking session) and Fast \u0026amp Fresh (quick and simple recipes). So a typical weekday might look like, banoffee oats for breakfast, a convincing vegan take on the classic BLT sandwich for lunch and creamy satay noodles with salt and pepper fried tofu for tea.Veganuary becomes bigger every year, but it needn\u0027t be just for Janaury as these cookbooks make it easy and accessible. Words by Stacey Smith213 ‘Rachel Ama’s Vegan Eats: Tasty plant-based recipes for every day’ by Rachel Ama. Published by Ebury Press: £12.87, AmazonSince launching her vegan YouTube channel in 2017, Rachel has gained a heap of hungry followers who lap up her simple, delicious recipes (and the dance moves that go along with them). Dishes are often one-pot, can be prepped ahead, and most include a song recommendation so you can dance along as you cook. Within these pages, you’ll find plenty of meals inspired by Ama’s Caribbean and West African roots – from crispy jerk barbecue tacos or ackee “saltfish” with dumplings to peanut stew. Although this is really a celebration of all cultures – and with vegan takes on everything from Thai green curry to creamy cashew and vegetable no-pasta lasagne, we’re pretty confident you’ll find your favourite comfort dish has been given a plant-based makeover. With most ingredients easy to obtain and meals quick to put together, this is modern cooking, for the meat-shunning millennial. 313 ‘BOSH! Healthy Vegan’ by Henry Firth \u0026amp Ian Theasby. Published by HQ: £10.87, AmazonWorking with a registered dietician to ensure recipes follow trusted NHS guidelines, the BOSH! boys (aka, Henry and Ian) have bought us their healthiest cookbook to date. Recognising that just because a plate of food is vegan, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthy (vegan junk food certainly exists!), this is a collection of 80 new recipes showcasing their flavoursome vegan food with a healthier focus. Along with advice on sleep, movement and relaxing, there’s guidance on ensuring you get all the nutrients you need. And although the boys insist this isn’t a diet book, you’ll find recipes to help you reduce fat, build muscle and generally be a bit healthier. So whether you’re looking to up your protein intake (try the ultimate veg tacos), reduce your sugar intake with a summer-berry granola bowl or keep your calorie intake to under 500 per portion with puttanesca potato stew, you should be left feeling suitably inspired to kick start the new year.413 ‘Happy Vegan: Easy plant-based recipes to make the whole family happy’ by Fearne Cotton. Published by Seven Dials: £13.46, AmazonDespite Fearne Cotton not being a fully-fledged vegan herself (or perhaps because), this book got rave reviews from our panel, with both flexitarians, meat-eaters and vegans alike. Recipes are approachable, inexpensive and perfect for the whole family, so we can see ourselves working through them all in time. The broccoli katsu curry was a particular favourite and surprisingly easy to make and for tea time we’ll be trying our hand at her date and almond cake with caramel sauce which uses white miso paste and coconut cream to great effect.513 ‘Vegan One Pound Meals: Delicious budget-friendly plant-based recipes all for £1 per person’ by Miguel Barclay. Published by Headline Home: £10.75, AmazonIf ever there’s a time we feel the pinch, it’s January, with the festivities of Christmas long behind us but the credit card still to pay. Thankfully eating a plant-based diet could be the answer and in this book, you’ll find over 85 recipes all coming in at a frankly unbelievable £1 a portion. Our concerns that we’d be living off of beans on toast were quickly alleviated as we tucked into black bean meatballs and sticky aubergine bao. Full-flavoured, quick and easy, we couldn’t really ask for more.613 ‘Incredible Plant-Based Desserts: Colorful Vegan Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, and other Epic Delights’ by Anthea Cheng. Published by Quarry Books: £11.89, AmazonCalling all sweet-tooths! This collection of recipes from Australian blogger Anthea Cheng is celebratory food for the keen baker. You certainly couldn’t call dried rainbow pear slices convenient, quick or easy to make, however the impact they have when used to decorate her chai cake is truly show-stopping. If that all sounds a little intimidating, we found the Snack Time chapter much more manageable, with the likes of bliss balls, chocolate cups and cookies vying for attention, as well as Instagrammable breakfast bowls, beautifully presented with nut butters, granola and oats.713 ‘Dirty Vegan Another Bite’ by Matt Pritchard, published by Octopus Books: £20, Octopus BooksAfter 10 years of hard partying finally caught up with him, Matt decided to switch from the crazy pranks of MTV’s Dirty Sanchez to fitness – and is now a completely vegan endurance athlete. Believing a natural diet is key, Matt’s second cookbook is brimming with recipes full of veggies and largely focuses on un-processed ingredients (keeping the vegan cheese or meat-substitutes to a minimum). Some of Pritchard’s favourites include roasting tin laksa, sticky tofu bao buns and rhubarb and custard doughnuts. If you’re yet to convince your pal\u0027s that veganism is the way forward, we reckon the Dinner with Mates chapter will convert a few of them, with all the recipes you need to create a Mexican feast, a perfect picnic, a banging BBQ or a cracking Christmas spread. All in all we found recipes really varied, with us ear-marking nearly all of them to try at once.813 ‘5 Ingredient Vegan’ by Katy Beskow. Published by Quadrille: £12.08, AmazonLet’s face it, at the end of a long day the last thing any of us want to be doing – whether we’re following a plant-based diet or not – is trying to track down long lists of hard to find ingredients. This is the fourth book from the award-winning cook, writer and cookery tutor Katy Beskow and follows a similar simplified format, with each recipe requiring just five ingredients. Chapters include soups, lunches suppers, sweets and basics, with recipes beautifully laid out and gorgeous photography accompanying each one. Far from being basic, we were amazed to see we could create a beautiful Mediterranean briam (a layered courgette, potato and red onion bake from Greece) which was as delicious hot with crusty bread as it was cold for lunch the next day.913 ‘Zaika: Vegan recipes from India’ by Romy Gill. Published by Seven Dials : £10, AmazonGrowing up in a small town in West Bengal, India, very few people, including Romy Gill’s own family, ate meat regularly. It’s this home-cooked vegan food of her childhood that the chef and food writer wanted to share with us through her debut cookbook Zaika – meaning taste, or flavour. There’s an entire section dedicated to bread, including gram flour turmeric pancakes which are perfect with chutneys, a variety of rotis and parathas and light naan bread with nigella seeds. The Light \u0026amp Breezy chapter is all about showcasing the freshest ingredients – think watermelon and mint salad while the Warming the Heart chapter is where you’ll find hearty comfort food such as spicy red lentil dahl. The section we most fell for though was Labours of Love for when you’ve got time to really get lost in the kitchen – rich, creamy and so warming, we recommend the Baingan masala with baby aubergines, dill and coconut.1013 ‘Rebel Recipes: Maximum flavour, minimum fuss: the ultimate in vegan food’ by Niki Webster.

Minding the GapOne of the year’s biggest cinematic curveballs occurs at the midway point of this stirring documentary. Billed as a film about small-town US skate culture, Bing Liu’s Minding the Gap grows into a haunting depiction of class and masculinity, and how once inseparable groups of friends tend to untangle and erge as they come of age. Few of 2019’s films cast quite as long a shadow. Adam WhiteThe Farewell rips your heart out of your chest. Then it hands it back to you, wrapped gently in cotton wool. Director Lulu Wang loosely adapts a chapter in her own life, as we follow a young woman (Awkwafina) travelling back to China to say goodbye to her terminally ill grandmother. Delving into all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, it’s a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Clarisse LoughreyAn opportunity for Jordan Peele to cement his status as one of horror’s modern maestros, Us reels us in with old-fashioned thrills. Then it leaves us with the terrible dread of realising we’ve been looking into a mirror this whole time. Lupita Nyong\u0027o delivers two of this year’s best performances in one film, both as our hero and as her sinister doppelgänger – one of an army of “Tethereds” that emerge from underground seeking vengeance. Clarisse LoughreyAll of Pedro Almodovar’s films feel autobiographical in one way or another, but Pain \u0026amp Glory couldn’t be more lived-in if he stepped out in front of the camera to introduce every scene. A lushly romantic ode to cinema, shared history and cruelly interrupted love, it features a career-best performance from Antonio Banderas – Zorro at his most tender and vulnerable. Adam WhiteVox Lux is 2019’s most damning filmic portrait of American culture. We begin with a teenage girl (Raffey Cassidy), who survives a school shooting and ends up a pop star. As an adult, she’s played by a breezy, vicious Natalie Portman. Her strut is one part Sia, two parts Lady Gaga. It’s an ugly, despairing film that comes gift-wrapped in sequins, presenting art as the cavernous pit we throw our traumas into. Clarisse Loughrey620 15. Under the Silver LakeA paranoid puzzle box of a mystery, Under the Silver Lake is far more interested in the directions down the rabbit hole than allowing star Andrew Garfield to crawl his way out of it. That’s also the most pleasurable aspect of David Robert Mitchell’s film, a sunny LA noir which is sinister, hilarious and (potentially ruinously) male. It’s probably 2019’s most polarising film, adored and reviled in equal measure, but undeniably a work of striking creative autonomy. Adam WhiteHigh Life has its silly sub-Barbarella moments (Juliette Binoche testing out the spaceship’s very own orgasmatron machine) and clearly wasn’t made on a Hollywood budget. Nonetheless, veteran French auteur Claire Denis’s first English language film is a typically provocative and subversive affair. Binoche plays Dr Dibs, a scientist on board a ship full of criminals and trying to harvest healthy foetuses. Geoffrey MacnabAd Astra is a space movie with an Oedipal undertow. Brad Pitt gives a fine, understated performance as the introspective astronaut trying to save the world and find his father at the same time. Writer-director James Gray throws in references to Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now. This is a slow-moving but beguiling film with an unexpected emotional kick. Geoffrey Macnab920 12. Happy as LazzaroA bee keeper’s daughter, Italian director Alice Rohrwacher is one of European cinema’s visionary young talents. Happy As Lazzaro, her best film yet, is a magical realist fable that combines hard-hitting social comment about the exploitation of rural workers with flights of astonishing lyricism. The film also has one of the best performances of the year from newcomer Adriano Tardiolo, an 18-year-old economics student who plays the holy innocent, Lazzaro, with an ingenuousness which rekindles memories of Peter Sellers in Being There. Geoffrey MacnabBased on a Haruki Murakami’s short story, Burning – from South Korean maestro Lee Chang-dong – is a meditation on dealing with isolation and the tricks being alone might play on your memory. Jong-su (Ah-in Yoo) is forced to play detective when Steven Yeun’s affluent bachelor rolls into town – an event that coincides with the disappearance of a schoolfriend. Burning is a searing drama whose central unanswered mystery unnerves long after the credits role. Jacob StolworthyNews coverage has hardly been short of harrowing, violent footage of the Syrian Civil War. But too often missing are the human moments inbetween the bombings and the bloodshed. In Waad Al-Kateab’s first person account of the uprising’s aftermath, her camera’s gaze never flinches from the horrors it sees – as she and her husband try to maintain a rebel hospital amid a reign of bombing from President al-Assad – but nor does it stop rolling while she falls in love, has a baby, and jokes around with her friends and neighbours. This is the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It is an important, powerful, astonishing documentary. Alex PollardIt feels almost blasphemous to be glad of Julianne Moore stepping down from a role, but Lee Israel – the cantankerous, lonely literary forger who found herself the target of an FBI investigation in the Nineties – feels like a part Melissa McCarthy was born to play. Nimbly directed by Marielle Heller (who was shunned by the Oscars in the Best Director category), Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a sharp, funny and deeply compassionate examination of loneliness and self-destruction. Richard E Grant and Dolly Wells give wonderful supporting performances, too. Alex PollardAs deeply indebted to the teen movie genre as it is formally and narratively rebellious, Booksmart grounds its traditional night-before-graduation plot (teenagers eager to crash a party) in touching character-driven drama. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, both instant stars, convey the ever-shifting dynamics and heightened dramas of adolescent best-friendship perfectly. Behind the camera, meanwhile, actor-turned-director Olivia Wilde demonstrates a staggering amount of emotional empathy and technical mastery for someone so green. Adam WhiteComparisons to Martin Scorsese’s previous films (Goodfellas, Casino) are unfounded considering The Irishman is unlike any other gangster film you’ll see. With his three-hour-30-minute-long opus, Scorsese places the harsh spotlight on mortality. Instead of tracking the rise of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) from regular family man to seasoned hitman with glitzy panache, we see him shamefully confess his crimes as an elderly man ruminating on his past in a nursing home. The result is an unsettlingly moving character study unafraid to ask the big questions.​Jacob Stolworthy1520 6. Once Upon a Time in HollywoodWith his ninth feature, Quentin Tarantino took a breath and crafted an unhurried, oddly heartwarming fable, one that came with a career-best performance from Brad Pitt. Its release rolled around with the usual smattering of discourse-steering controversy but, for all the complaints about the director’s depiction of his film star subjects, including the scant usage of Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, the fact remains that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is one of the filmmaker’s most accomplished films – a free’n’easy sun-soaked delve into Sixties Hollywood, whose much-discussed final 20 minutes provided topics of conversation all summer long. Jacob StolworthyFor too many years the internet was exclusively evil in movies, something for tech boffins to hack, or used to steal Sandra Bullock’s identity. Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade felt so comparatively real because it felt like the real internet, which has been as toxic and terrifying as it has been helpful to a generation of young people. Elsie Fisher, as a 13-year-old girl chronicling her confidence and anxieties in a vlog, is an adorable delight here, in a film that is devastatingly, heartbreakingly and endearingly human. Adam WhiteYorgos Lanthimos’s delightful, subversive vision has shaken the cobwebs out of costume drama. Set in the 18th century, it follows a trio of women – two cousins, Sarah (Rachel Weisz) and Abigail (Emma Stone), and the ruling Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) – as they vie for power over each other and England. Desire, savagery, and manipulative vulnerability all become weapons in the hands of those who have no choice but to fight dirty. But, then, Colman’s childless, gout-ridden Queen Anne tenderly reveals her shattered soul – it’s an Academy Award-winning performance that brings a slice of tragedy to an otherwise sublime farce. Clarisse LoughreyThe marriage of disparate talents united to ensure If Beale Street Could Talk is worthy of mention alongside Barry Jenkins’ previous film, Moonlight – The Independent’s film of the decade. With his film, Jenkins takes the words of James Baldwin and translates them into visual poetry. From Nicholas Britell’s mesmerising score to Regina King’s towering supporting performance (that Oscar was well deserved), the result is a creative tour de force. Jacob StolworthyHere is a love story about orce. Noah Baumbach writes and directs this aching, empathetic depiction of a couple whose marriage has fallen apart. As ruthless orce lawyers driving a wedge between two people already hanging by a thread, Ray Liotta and Laura Dern are magnificent, while Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance in years as a woman trying to do the right thing without knowing what that is. But the real star is Adam Driver, who – hulking as he is – makes himself seem small and fragile. For his rendition of Sondheim’s “Being Alive” alone, Marriage Story deserves all the awards coming its way. Alex PollardGreta Gerwig’s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 novel – the story of four Massachusetts sisters coming of age during the American Civil War – may be a period piece, but there is nothing staid or stuffy about it. The girls, played by Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen, talk and clamber over one another, their hair messy, their dresses scorched, their ambitions unfettered. It is a lively, profound adaptation. Alexandre Desplat provides the exuberant score, and Yorick La Saux’s cinematography is lush and textured. “I didn’t want it to be beautiful at the expense of being real,” said Gerwig. “But I did want it to feel like you wish you can jump inside and live in there or eat it. I remember trying to explain that to the gaffer, who was like, ‘You want what?’ I was like, ‘I want them to want to eat it.’” And how delicious it is. Alex Pollard120 20. Minding the GapOne of the year’s biggest cinematic curveballs occurs at the midway point of this stirring documentary. Billed as a film about small-town US skate culture, Bing Liu’s Minding the Gap grows into a haunting depiction of class and masculinity, and how once inseparable groups of friends tend to untangle and erge as they come of age. Few of 2019’s films cast quite as long a shadow. Adam WhiteThe Farewell rips your heart out of your chest. Then it hands it back to you, wrapped gently in cotton wool. Director Lulu Wang loosely adapts a chapter in her own life, as we follow a young woman (Awkwafina) travelling back to China to say goodbye to her terminally ill grandmother. Delving into all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, it’s a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Clarisse LoughreyAn opportunity for Jordan Peele to cement his status as one of horror’s modern maestros, Us reels us in with old-fashioned thrills. Then it leaves us with the terrible dread of realising we’ve been looking into a mirror this whole time. Lupita Nyong\u0027o delivers two of this year’s best performances in one film, both as our hero and as her sinister doppelgänger – one of an army of “Tethereds” that emerge from underground seeking vengeance. Clarisse LoughreyAll of Pedro Almodovar’s films feel autobiographical in one way or another, but Pain \u0026amp Glory couldn’t be more lived-in if he stepped out in front of the camera to introduce every scene. A lushly romantic ode to cinema, shared history and cruelly interrupted love, it features a career-best performance from Antonio Banderas – Zorro at his most tender and vulnerable. Adam WhiteVox Lux is 2019’s most damning filmic portrait of American culture. We begin with a teenage girl (Raffey Cassidy), who survives a school shooting and ends up a pop star. As an adult, she’s played by a breezy, vicious Natalie Portman. Her strut is one part Sia, two parts Lady Gaga. It’s an ugly, despairing film that comes gift-wrapped in sequins, presenting art as the cavernous pit we throw our traumas into. Clarisse Loughrey620 15. Under the Silver LakeA paranoid puzzle box of a mystery, Under the Silver Lake is far more interested in the directions down the rabbit hole than allowing star Andrew Garfield to crawl his way out of it. That’s also the most pleasurable aspect of David Robert Mitchell’s film, a sunny LA noir which is sinister, hilarious and (potentially ruinously) male. It’s probably 2019’s most polarising film, adored and reviled in equal measure, but undeniably a work of striking creative autonomy. Adam WhiteHigh Life has its silly sub-Barbarella moments (Juliette Binoche testing out the spaceship’s very own orgasmatron machine) and clearly wasn’t made on a Hollywood budget. Nonetheless, veteran French auteur Claire Denis’s first English language film is a typically provocative and subversive affair. Binoche plays Dr Dibs, a scientist on board a ship full of criminals and trying to harvest healthy foetuses. Geoffrey MacnabAd Astra is a space movie with an Oedipal undertow. Brad Pitt gives a fine, understated performance as the introspective astronaut trying to save the world and find his father at the same time. Writer-director James Gray throws in references to Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now. This is a slow-moving but beguiling film with an unexpected emotional kick. Geoffrey Macnab920 12. Happy as LazzaroA bee keeper’s daughter, Italian director Alice Rohrwacher is one of European cinema’s visionary young talents. Happy As Lazzaro, her best film yet, is a magical realist fable that combines hard-hitting social comment about the exploitation of rural workers with flights of astonishing lyricism. The film also has one of the best performances of the year from newcomer Adriano Tardiolo, an 18-year-old economics student who plays the holy innocent, Lazzaro, with an ingenuousness which rekindles memories of Peter Sellers in Being There. Geoffrey MacnabBased on a Haruki Murakami’s short story, Burning – from South Korean maestro Lee Chang-dong – is a meditation on dealing with isolation and the tricks being alone might play on your memory. Jong-su (Ah-in Yoo) is forced to play detective when Steven Yeun’s affluent bachelor rolls into town – an event that coincides with the disappearance of a schoolfriend. Burning is a searing drama whose central unanswered mystery unnerves long after the credits role. Jacob StolworthyNews coverage has hardly been short of harrowing, violent footage of the Syrian Civil War. But too often missing are the human moments inbetween the bombings and the bloodshed.

Alex PollardBurke said organisers planned on “repeating what worked for us last year – huge entertainment value, big musical numbers, big comedy.”“A lot of incredible elements have already come together and convinced us that we are going to have an incredibly entertaining show again,” she added, without giving details.Nominations for the 2020 Oscars will be announced on Monday.Additional reporting by agenciesThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

nominations have been decided.Comprised of an estimated 6,000 motion picture professionals – the identity of whom remains a “closely guarded secret” – the Academy has, according to Deadline, been saving their votes for the last minute in an attempt to see every film in contention for trophies.It’s because of this desire to see everything that makes the Golden Globes winners an important part of the awards race – for example, if a member was yet to see Sam Mendes’ First World War drama 1917, its unexpected win in the Best Film – Drama category at Sunday night’s ceremony would have no doubt brought that film to the top of the list.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesStill, the Golden Globes have failed to hint at eventual Oscar winners in the past – The Hurt Locker and Spotlight are two films that went on to win Best Picture but they won absolutely nothing at the Globes.The best predictions of what will be nominated for the big awards can be formulated by assessing those named by the Producers Guild (PGA), Directors Guild (DGA), Writers Guild (WGA) and the Baftas, which sparked fury for a severe lack of ersity among its nominations when announced earlier this week.Created with Sketch.Golden Globes: All the night\u0027s winners, in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Once Upon a Time in HollywoodThe cast and

nominations\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspless than a week away, below are how the odds are looking for all the films that are likely to be named by the Academy.\u0026nbspThe favourite to win may currently be Parasite, but two films that have attracted a flurry of bets following the Globes are 1917 and Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which won Best Film – Comedy or Musical. This has been a complete reversal from about a month ago, which had The Irishman and Marriage Story sitting high as favourites. Still, if Parasite should win, it’ll be the first foreign language film to do so in Oscar history, a feat that was expected to be achieved by Netflix’s Roma up until Green Book beat it in the eleventh hour.Following his win at the Golden Globes, Sam Mendes – whose war film 1917 is a two-take drama following two soldiers’ journey behind enemy lines – is now the one to beat for the prize. He previously won in 2000 for American Beauty. While mob drama The Irishman‘s Best Picture odds have somewhat drifted, director Martin Scorsese still sits high as one of the most heavily-backed filmmakers in the category alongside South Korean director Bong Joon-ho, who received a standing ovation after winning at the DGAs earlier this week.Ricky Gervais shocks Golden Globes with Leonardo DiCaprio joke Ricky Gervais draws gasps with Harvey Weinstein ‘truth bomb’Fleabag and Olivia Colman lead British winners at Golden GlobesThis is Joaquin Phoenix’s for the taking ands the odds reflect this. His controversial role in Joker has been a favourite since the film premiered at festivals last Autumn and his Golden Globe win seems to have secured his first Academy Award. Still, with a month to go, Taron Egerton could work the campaign trail to his advantage. The Rocketman star is clearly well-liked by voters and, after Rami Malek won for playing Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, its clear music biopics are in favour among those that matter.At this stage, they may as well just give the trophy to Renée​ Zellweger. While Judy would be lucky to get nominations in any other category, it seems destined to become an Oscar-winner thanks to Zellweger’s lead role of Hollywood icon Judy Garland. Her only real competition seems to be Scarlett Johansson for her role in Marriage Story – a nomination on Monday would mark a first for the actor.This could perhaps be the most exciting – and closest – category of the night. Brad Pitt (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) shouldn’t go celebrating yet – even if, throughout his career, Tarantino has become something of a Supporting Actor whisperer (Christoph Waltz won in this category twice of Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained). Both Al Pacino and Joe Pesci will provide strong competition for their work in The Irishman – as will\u0026nbspSong Kang-ho, the lead star of Parasite. Still, the most money is going on Brad.Created with Sketch.The actors who’ve won the most Oscars Show all 41Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It was the Austrian-born actor’s long-running collaboration with controversial filmmaker Quentin Tarantino that brought him to the mainstream public consciousness. In Inglourious Basterds, Waltz plays terrifying Nazi colonel Hans Landa, while in Django Unchained, he seems a world apart playing benevolent dentist-cum-bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. Both roles were rewarded with Oscars for Best Supporting Actor.Spacey won two Oscars, for The Usual Suspects in 1996 and American Beauty in 2000. After numerous allegations of sexual assault emerged in 2017, the actor was removed from the Ridley Scott film All the Money in the World, and Christopher Plummer was given a Best Supporting Actor nomination after reshooting Spacey’s scenes in his stead.Swank won two awards for Best Actress, for Boys Don’t Cry and Million Dollar Baby. Accepting the award for the former, Swank neglected to thank her then-husband, Chad Lowe. Girls star Lena Dunham would later thank Lowe when she received a Golden Globe in 2013, tweeting that she did it “because Hilary Swank forgot.”Leigh’s performances as Scarlett O’Hara in Gone with the Wind in 1939 and as Blanche DuBois in the Tennessee Willimas adaptation A Streetcar Named Desire in 1951 stand as two of the most iconic in film history. The actress was fittingly rewarded for the roles, taking home a Best Actress trophy each time.Wiest appeared in five films by writer-director Woody Allen, winning Best Supporting Actress awards for her roles in Hannah and Her Sisters and Bullets Over Broadway. She is currently a regular on the CBS sit-com Life in Pieces.Ustinov was a highly acclaimed performer – with two Academy Awards to his name, for Spartacus and Topkapi – but was in no way limited to acting. Ustinov held a panoply of other occupations, including as a writer, a dramatist, a filmmaker, a director of theatre and opera, a humorist, a newspaper columnist, a radio broadcaster and a TV presenter. The son of a stage and silent film actor who was a victim of Hollywood’s transition to sound, Jason Robards was blessed with more success in the industry, eventually winning two Academy Awards. The actor appeared in numerous stage and screen adaptations of Eugene O’Neill plays, but it was his work in All the President’s Men that bagged him his first Best Supporting Actor statuette, doubling his tally the next year, in 1977, with Julia.Douglas won two Oscars, for Hud (1963) and for acting alongside a revelatory Peter Sellers in Being There (1969). The actor was known for being an outspoken anti-fascist ever since visiting Europe in 1931 with his wife, Helen Gahagan, who served three terms as a US Congresswoman, running against Richard Nixon for Governor in 1950.Over the course of her 63-year career, Winters appeared in successful blockbusters such as The Poseidon Adventure. But it was her more nuanced supporting roles in 1960’s The Diary of Anne Frank and 1965’s A Patch of Blue that would win over Academy voters, for which she collected two awards in the category.Quinn is something of an anomaly in the ranks of multiple Oscar-winners. The actor was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, in 1915, to a Mexican mother and an Irish father, and is one of one only five actors with a Latin-American background to win an acting Oscar – the others being Rita Moreno, José Ferrer, Mercedes Ruehl, and Benicio del Toro – and the only one to win twice. Roma nominees Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira are in contention this year.Jackson was one of the most accomplished actors of her generation, with two Best Actress wins under her belt by the age of 37 (for Women in Love and A Touch of Class). But starting in 1992, she took a 23-year sabbatical from the industry, serving as the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn.Long before she was captivating younger audiences with her roles in the Harry Potter franchise and popular TV series Downton Abbey, Dame Maggie Smith had wowed Oscar voters with The Prime of Miss Jean Brody (1969), adding a Best Supporting Actress win for California Suite in 1978.Davis won her only two Best Actress Oscars in 1935 and 1938 – for Dangerous and Jezebel respectively –but over the course of her hugely successful six-decade career, she would continue to accrue more nominations, eventually becoming the first actor to reach a milestone of 10.Along with Helen Hayes, March is one of only two actors to win two Oscars and two Tony Awards. The multi-talented star won Best Actor for the bifurcated titular role in 1931’s horror adaptation Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, winning again in 1946 for The Best Years of Our Lives, a post-WWII drama about soldiers returning home from the war.Field’s Oscar win for Places in the Heart in 1985 has been immortalised by her acceptance speech – which included the infamous lines “you like me, right now, you really like me” - but the actor had already proven she was more than just a soundbite having won the same trophy for her star turn in Norma Rae five years earlier.Taylor gained 30 pounds for the 1966 black comedy Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, a film which sees her trapped in a poisonous marriage with a character played by her off-and-on real-life paramour Richard Burton. The star had previously nabbed a Best Actress award for her portrayal of a sex worker in BUtterfield 8, a film she claimed to dislike.After scooping up the Best Actor prize in 2003 for Mystic River, Penn won another for portraying iconic LGBT campaigner and US politician Harvey Milk, who was assassinated in 1978. Penn opened his victory speech with “Thank you. Thank you. You commie, homo-loving sons-of-guns!”Fargo Oscar-winner McDormand delivered a rousing address at the 2018 Oscar ceremony, demanding an end to Hollywood’s gender imbalance. The speech, made while accepting her second Best Actress prize - for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri - brought all the women in the audience to their feet in solidarity. She ended her speech with the phrase “inclusion rider,” a stipulation that can be put into a performer’s contract to ensure equal opportunity hiring on set.Hackman won his first Oscar playing “Popeye” Doyle in William Friedkin’s The French Connection – a taboo-busting cop thriller that was hardly the stuff of Academy tradition. 19 years later, his supporting turn as the villain in Clint Eastwood’s revisionist Western Unforgiven made it a double.Hanks made his name in romantic comedies with some successes in the 1980s, but his first Oscar win – for AIDS drama Philadelphia - was a big departure. The next year, in 1995, he won again, for the hugely popular Forrest Gump.Dame Olivia de Havilland, now 102 years old, is perhaps best known for her role in Gone with the Wind. Garnering five nominations across her career, de Havilland took home two statuettes in the 1940s, for To Each His Own and The Heiress.Next to Luise Rainer, Jodie Foster is the only other actor to have won two Oscars before the age of 30, for The Accused in 1988, and Silence of the Lambs in 1991. It’s a fitting record for an actor whose career took off while she was still a child, with breakout roles in Bugsy Malone and Taxi Driver.Sir Michael Caine, familiar around the globe for his distinctive cockney accent, once confessed that 1983’s Educating Rita was “the last good picture I made before I mentally retired.” In spite of this, the actor managed to win Oscars for Hannah and Her Sisters in 1986 and The Cider House Rules in 1999.Cooper won his first Best Actor Oscar in 1942 for Sergeant York. The famously stoic star didn’t turn up to collect his second award – for an understated turn in the classic Western High Noon – instead sending John Wayne, who said: Coop and I have been friends, hunting and fishing, for more years than I like to remember. He\u0027s one of the nicest fellows I know. I don\u0027t know anybody any nicer.”In 1982, Jessica Lange became the first star in nearly four decades to be nominated for two films in the same year, for Tootsie and Frances, the former of which yielded a win. Lange is currently tied as the sixth most nominated Actress in history.Initially winning at the same time as co-star Meryl Streep for Kramer Vs Kramer, Hoffman’s second Best Actor Oscar came for Rain Man in 1988, in a role which has been recognised as important in raising awareness of autism.The poster girl for the flower child generation, Jane Fonda was always expected to politicise the Oscars. After an unexpectedly reserved acceptance speech for Klute in 1972, she presented part of her 1979 speech – for Coming Home – in sign language.Following a supporting turn in 1974’s The Godfather Part II, Robert De Niro’s second Oscar-winning role, playing boxer Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull, is about as hard-earned as they come. The actor honed his boxing ability to professional standards, and gained approximately 60 pounds to play an older, washed-up version of the character.The Aviator is often dismissed as a minor Martin Scorsese film, but the Howard Hawks biopic won Blanchett her first Oscar in 2004. She would have to wait until Blue Jasmine seven years later - her sixth nominated performance, out of seven total - to win in the Best Actress category.Lemmon was legendary for his mastery of both comedy and pathos, and it was chiefly his humorous chops that saw him win Best Supporting Actor in 1955, for his role in Mister Roberts. With a follow-up win for Save the Tiger, the Some Like it Hot star became the first actor to claim Oscar wins in both the lead and supporting categories.Eight-time Oscar nominee Brando influenced a generation of actors with his revolutionary approaches to method, winning Hollywood’s biggest prize twice in the process - for On the Waterfront (1954) and The Godfather (1974). Brando famously sent Native American actress Sacheen Littlefeather to accept his second award in protest of the industry’s representation of Native Americans. Littlefeather later revealed the protest caused her to be blacklisted by many studios.Spencer Tracy won two Oscars from nine nominations for Best Actor. He holds the joint record for the most nominations in the category, along with Laurence Olivier, who won only once.Rainer has been described as the first victim of the so-called “Oscar curse”. The Austrian-American star won Best Actress twice in quick succession – for The Great Ziegfeld in 1936 and for The Good Earth in 1937 – which resulted in MGM studios eagerly miscasting her in a series of flops. This would lead to a 54-year break from cinema, before returning alongside Michael Gambon in 1997’s The Gambler.Helen Hayes holds the record for being the actor with the longest gap between two Oscar victories. A practiced stage actress, Hayes also appeared in a few silent films before making her debut ‘talkie’ The Sin of Madelon Claudet, for which she won Best Actress. Hayes’s next and final win would be for a supporting role in Airport, nearly 40 years later.Denzel Washington is the only black actor to win multiple competitive Academy Awards, for Glory in 1990 – a Best Supporting Actor award - and then Training Day in 2002. No African-American actor has won more than one award since, although Mahershala Ali could match his total should he win for Green Book.Brennan had originally started work as an extra after losing most of his money in the 1925 real estate slump, appearing (often uncredited) in over 120 films across the next decade. He would then win three Best Supporting Actor Oscars in the space of four years, for Come and Get It (1936), Kentucky (1938) and The Westerner (1940).Nicholson became regarded as one of the voices of his generation at the start of the 1970s with iconic roles in Easy Rider and Five Easy Pieces, but it took six nominations for him to win his first Oscar, for the Miloš Forman-directed One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest in 1976. He would later win two more, one for Terms of Endearment and the other for As Good as It Gets.Ingrid Bergman, the Swedish star who successfully crossed over to Hollywood in 1939, won three Oscars during her career, beginning with Gaslight in 1944. An extra-marital affair with director Roberto Rossellini in the early 1950s scandalised her American audience, but the success of Anastasia in 1956 brought her back into the bosom of the public favour and she won a second Best Actress trophy. She added a Supporting Actress honour in 1974 for Murder on the Orient Express, one of her last film projects.Sir Daniel Day-Lewis is the only male actor to win three Best Actor awards, for his roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln. After writing himself into the annals of film history with his 2012 win for portraying the American president, Day-Lewis took a step back from the industry, appearing in only one film since – Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread - which he has claimed is his final role. For Meryl Streep, Oscar nominations are nearly as regular as dental appointments. Streep’s name has appeared on the ballot a total of 21 times, 17 of which were in the Best Actress category, and she has won three times: for Kramer vs Kramer in 1980, Sophie’s Choice in 1983, and The Iron Lady in 2012.Katharine Hepburn boasts more Oscar victories – four – than any other actor, all in the Actress in a Leading Role category. Hepburn’s The Lion in Winter trophy was shared with Barbra Streisand in the only ever instance of a tied Best Actress result. Hepburn never attended any of the ceremonies.It was the Austrian-born actor’s long-running collaboration with controversial filmmaker Quentin Tarantino that brought him to the mainstream public consciousness. In Inglourious Basterds, Waltz plays terrifying Nazi colonel Hans Landa, while in Django Unchained, he seems a world apart playing benevolent dentist-cum-bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. Both roles were rewarded with Oscars for Best Supporting Actor.Spacey won two Oscars, for The Usual Suspects in 1996 and American Beauty in 2000. After numerous allegations of sexual assault emerged in 2017, the actor was removed from the Ridley Scott film All the Money in the World, and Christopher Plummer was given a Best Supporting Actor nomination after reshooting Spacey’s scenes in his stead.Swank won two awards for Best Actress, for Boys Don’t Cry and Million Dollar Baby. Accepting the award for the former, Swank neglected to thank her then-husband, Chad Lowe. Girls star Lena Dunham would later thank Lowe when she received a Golden Globe in 2013, tweeting that she did it “because Hilary Swank forgot.”Leigh’s performances as Scarlett O’Hara in Gone with the Wind in 1939 and as Blanche DuBois in the Tennessee Willimas adaptation A Streetcar Named Desire in 1951 stand as two of the most iconic in film history. The actress was fittingly rewarded for the roles, taking home a Best Actress trophy each time.Wiest appeared in five films by writer-director Woody Allen, winning Best Supporting Actress awards for her roles in Hannah and Her Sisters and Bullets Over Broadway. She is currently a regular on the CBS sit-com Life in Pieces.Ustinov was a highly acclaimed performer – with two Academy Awards to his name, for Spartacus and Topkapi – but was in no way limited to acting. Ustinov held a panoply of other occupations, including as a writer, a dramatist, a filmmaker, a director of theatre and opera, a humorist, a newspaper columnist, a radio broadcaster and a TV presenter. The son of a stage and silent film actor who was a victim of Hollywood’s transition to sound, Jason Robards was blessed with more success in the industry, eventually winning two Academy Awards. The actor appeared in numerous stage and screen adaptations of Eugene O’Neill plays, but it was his work in All the President’s Men that bagged him his first Best Supporting Actor statuette, doubling his tally the next year, in 1977, with Julia.Douglas won two Oscars, for Hud (1963) and for acting alongside a revelatory Peter Sellers in Being There (1969). The actor was known for being an outspoken anti-fascist ever since visiting Europe in 1931 with his wife, Helen Gahagan, who served three terms as a US Congresswoman, running against Richard Nixon for Governor in 1950.Over the course of her 63-year career, Winters appeared in successful blockbusters such as The Poseidon Adventure. But it was her more nuanced supporting roles in 1960’s The Diary of Anne Frank and 1965’s A Patch of Blue that would win over Academy voters, for which she collected two awards in the category.Quinn is something of an anomaly in the ranks of multiple Oscar-winners. The actor was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, in 1915, to a Mexican mother and an Irish father, and is one of one only five actors with a Latin-American background to win an acting Oscar – the others being Rita Moreno, José Ferrer, Mercedes Ruehl, and Benicio del Toro – and the only one to win twice. Roma nominees Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira are in contention this year.Jackson was one of the most accomplished actors of her generation, with two Best Actress wins under her belt by the age of 37 (for Women in Love and A Touch of Class). But starting in 1992, she took a 23-year sabbatical from the industry, serving as the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn.Long before she was captivating younger audiences with her roles in the Harry Potter franchise and popular TV series Downton Abbey, Dame Maggie Smith had wowed Oscar voters with The Prime of Miss Jean Brody (1969), adding a Best Supporting Actress win for California Suite in 1978.Davis won her only two Best Actress Oscars in 1935 and 1938 – for Dangerous and Jezebel respectively –but over the course of her hugely successful six-decade career, she would continue to accrue more nominations, eventually becoming the first actor to reach a milestone of 10.Along with Helen Hayes, March is one of only two actors to win two Oscars and two Tony Awards. The multi-talented star won Best Actor for the bifurcated titular role in 1931’s horror adaptation Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, winning again in 1946 for The Best Years of Our Lives, a post-WWII drama about soldiers returning home from the war.Field’s Oscar win for Places in the Heart in 1985 has been immortalised by her acceptance speech – which included the infamous lines “you like me, right now, you really like me” - but the actor had already proven she was more than just a soundbite having won the same trophy for her star turn in Norma Rae five years earlier.Taylor gained 30 pounds for the 1966 black comedy Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, a film which sees her trapped in a poisonous marriage with a character played by her off-and-on real-life paramour Richard Burton. The star had previously nabbed a Best Actress award for her portrayal of a sex worker in BUtterfield 8, a film she claimed to dislike.After scooping up the Best Actor prize in 2003 for Mystic River, Penn won another for portraying iconic LGBT campaigner and US politician Harvey Milk, who was assassinated in 1978. Penn opened his victory speech with “Thank you. Thank you. You commie, homo-loving sons-of-guns!”Fargo Oscar-winner McDormand delivered a rousing address at the 2018 Oscar ceremony, demanding an end to Hollywood’s gender imbalance. The speech, made while accepting her second Best Actress prize - for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri - brought all the women in the audience to their feet in solidarity. She ended her speech with the phrase “inclusion rider,” a stipulation that can be put into a performer’s contract to ensure equal opportunity hiring on set.Hackman won his first Oscar playing “Popeye” Doyle in William Friedkin’s The French Connection – a taboo-busting cop thriller that was hardly the stuff of Academy tradition. 19 years later, his supporting turn as the villain in Clint Eastwood’s revisionist Western Unforgiven made it a double.Hanks made his name in romantic comedies with some successes in the 1980s, but his first Oscar win – for AIDS drama Philadelphia - was a big departure.

According to the odds, Marriage Story‘s Laura Dern – who was last nominated in this category in 2014 for Wild – will not only be named on Monday, but will win the prize come Oscars night. Her closest competitor is said to Hustlers star Jennifer Lopez, although the fact she was shut out by Bafta doesn’t bode well for her chances.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Oscar nominations will be announced on Monday at 1pm\u0026nbspGMT with the ceremony scheduled to take place in Los Angeles on 9 February.

This could be about to change, after transport giants Daimler and Delta partnered with IBM to develop real-world applications for the nascent technology.For the Mercedes manufacturer, it could result in electric vehicle batteries capable of travelling more than 1,000km\u0026nbspwithout needing to recharge.For the world’s most valuable airline, it could mean vastly improved route scheduling, with Delta CIO Rahul\u0026nbspSamant\u0026nbspsaying the partnership with IBM would allow the airline to “draw the blueprints” for quantum computers within the\u0026nbspindustry.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesQuantum computers promise to make such advancements possible by combining the peculiar properties of quantum physics with computer science to achieve processing power that is exponentially more powerful than traditional computers.But realising this promise is still a long way off. Quantum computers were first theorised in 1982 but it took until last year for one of these machines to perform a calculation that would be impossible with a classical computer.Created with Sketch.Scientists claim to have achieved quantum supremacy Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This milestone, known as\u0026nbspquantum supremacy, was touted by the Google researchers who achieved it as “heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm” that had finally demonstrated the technologies capabilities, albeit in an extremely narrow way.“As a result of these developments, quantum computing is transitioning from a research topic to a technology that unlocks new computational capabilities,” the researchers wrote in the\u0026nbspNature\u0026nbsppaper detailing their achievement. “We are only one creative algorithm away from valuable near-term applications.”‘Quantum apocalypse’: How super computers could cripple governmentsThe hype around quantum computers means it risks becoming another tech buzzword that companies arbitrarily include to promote products, similar to the way terms like AI and blockchain have in recent years.In 2016, IBM was the first company to make quantum computers accessible via another buzzword – the cloud – meaning that computer scientists could conduct experiments and carry out research using the machines from anywhere in the world.One of the first challenges quantum computers\u0026nbspwill work on at Daimler is in improving the capacity and charge speed of batteries, referred to by IBM researchers as the Achilles Heel of electric vehicles.Next-generation lithium-sulphur batteries offer a solution to the limitations of lithium-ion batteries, which are currently used in everything from smartphones to electric cars. Theoretically, lithium-sulphur batteries are capable of holding up to five-times more energy than lithium-ion batteries, but until now they have been hugely impractical for commercial use.Daimler and IBM will use a quantum computer\u0026nbspto simulate molecules on a previously impossible scale in order to figure out a way to make this battery technology suitable for every-day use.A quantum computing breakthrough could help tackle this challenge, said Jeanette Garcia, a senior manager in the quantum applications, algorithms and theory team at IBM Research.As they improve, the machines will become exponentially more powerful. So while we haven\u0027t yet achieved quantum advantage, this type of research is the foundational work that will eventually get us there.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Shutdowns generally came in response to protests or civil unrest, especially in the build-up to elections.WhatsApp is about to stop working on these phonesBeyond the economic impact, the researchers said the shutdowns were especially worrying for human rights and democracy.However, not all shutdowns were an attempt to stifle free speech. In India last August,\u0026nbspinternet connections were blocked in an attempt to prevent rumour-mongering and the spread of misinformation that led to violent protests in some areas of the country.A spokesperson for WhatsApp said at the time: The challenge of mob violence requires government, civil society, and technology companies to work together.

The nurses were around her.“She [Thornberry] had her left hand up in the air and they quite quickly put it in a sling for her.“We were there for over two hours in total. It felt aswe weren’t as important.“I was there with someone struggling quite badly to breathe, they in a lot of distress.“We were still sat there at that time she left - although we’d been there half an hour before she arrived.“We were in a queue system so we were very concerned and frustrated.”Patients attending AE departments register and are normally pre-assessed by a nurse or doctor - known as triage.This is meant to ensure that those with the most serious conditions are seen first.Thornberry is MP for Islington South and Finsbury - a short distance from the hospital.Previously seen as an ally of Jeremy Corbyn she has said she will stand to replace him as Labour leader.A spokesman for Thornberry said: “Like everyone  at AE that day she waited to be seen for her badly-cut and bleeding hand for more than an hour.“At no stage did any member of staff in the waiting room acknowledge her or treat her dferently.“Emily is sorry that another patient and their friend had a bad experience waiting for treatment, but that had nothing to do with her.”Figures reveal that between July and September last year  per cent of AE patients at UCLH were treated, discharged or admitted within the four- hour target. The national target is  per cent.A UCLH spokesman said: “Patients in our emergency department are seen and treated according to their clinical needs.

The world is watching.IF HS goes to plan it will improve the lives of commuters, boost jobs in the North and Midlands and drag our creaking infrastructure into the st century.But a damning report revealing spending has spiralled out of control suggests that the scheme has become like a runaway train with a driver asleep at the wheel.Thanks to an obsession with speed, the project’s directors have overlooked connectivity — which should have been their priority.Given taxpayers are forking out billions — enough to build  new large hospitals — massive misjudgements like that are unforgivable.Those directors now have a choice.They can buck up their act and refocus on delivering real benefits for the North.Or they can keep splashing cash and wait until the Prime Minister puts the kibosh on the whole project.It’s time this plan got back on the rails.SLIPPERY Sadiq Khan can always be counted on to put ambition over principle.But the Labour London Mayor’s belated attack on Jeremy Corbyn brings new meaning to the word shameless.If he truly believed the public “got it right” when they rejected his party, he should have spoken out while the Marxist clowns were circling Number .Doing so now Corbyn has been safely confined to the dustbin of history proves Khan is nothing but a careerist coward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Then there is Rebecca Long-Bailey, she of the Mrs Merton spectacles, fanciedby Corbyn’s old Marxist sidekick John McDonnell.Long-Bailey is untested. But so are the others. I was going to shock you by noting that Thornberry, having once been a ministerial aide, is the only candidate to have had a snf of Whitehall experience.Then I realised that she is the only one of them to have actually sat on the governing side in the House of Commons.Nandy became an MP in , when Labour left office.The rest entered the Commons only in .OK, let’s look on the bright side. They should all have a certain novelty value.So how come they feel so unexciting  It’s because they represent old ideas.Tony Blair is nowadays a discredited figure but when he was leader of the Opposition in the s, he did something shrewd.He wrenched his party into the modern era by producing a pledge card with five basic promises. They helped him win a landslide in the  General Election.Blair’s five pledges reflected the electorate’s priorities: Smaller class sizes for primary schools, quicker punishment of young offenders, shorter NHS waiting times, getting younger people off benefits by using a windfall tax on privatised utilities, and a promise not to raise income tax.Blair grasped how Labour was seen by the voters. His pledge card helped address those worries. The policies themselves were only part of the trick. Equally important was the idea that Blair’s Labour was prepared to listen.A quarter of a century on, the next Labour leader should repeat Blair’s trick and be honest about how the party is seen.Here are five basic philosophical pledges that might help to address the problem.PLEDGE : Saving is a virtue. One reason Jeremy Corbyn bombed in last month’s election was that his spending plans were seen as madly extravagant. Voters may not like government “austerity” but they aren’t mugs. They know state spending has to be paid for.If you are a government or an inidual, you can’t live for ever on the never-never.It’s time Labour reacquainted itself with prudence.PLEDGE : Patriotism is honourable. Wouldn’t it be amazing to hear a Labour leader say this Yet since the decline of the British Empire, the Left has regarded patriotism as a dirty word. This is electorally crazy.Patriotism is merely an expression of civic pride, of communal values channelled into the identity of the democratic nation state and its Queen.Working-class former Labour voters love American patriotism .They applaud the Aussies and South Africans when they wave their flags.What is so wrong with being proud of Britain PLEDGE : Stable families strengthen us all.I’m not making a point about marital infidelities — MPs are the last people who should preach about sex! — but Labour’s promotion of metropolitan lestyles has created an idea it disapproves of “normal” family set-ups.Add to that its reluctance to give families tax breaks and its strange cultural suspicion of adoption. Former Labour seats are often areas with the strongest notion of traditional family solidarity.A wise leadership candidate would acknowledge that.PLEDGE : Brexit is irreversible. Please. This matter has been settled.And yet that fool Jess Phillips is hinting that she wants us to rejoin the EU. Electoral suicide.PLEDGE : No more jobsworths. Bigger than everything  is the suspicion that officialdom is an ass.The British people are wonderfully tolerant but they are driven mad by petty regulation — particularly when it comes to minority grievances.“Jobsworths” who say that ignoring daft political-correctness is “more than my job’s worth” are the bane of Britain.Who is more intolerant: A provincial baker who hesitates to ice a wedding cake for a gay couple, or the gay couple who take that baker to the High Court to prove a point We all know whose side Labour politicians would have been on.A would-be Labour leader who cheerfully made these pledges would be a Labour leader who could connect with the electoral mainstream.But will any of them do so  Don’t hold your breath.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Just because you ignore it, it doesn’t mean it no longer exists.Now research shows that going for regular runs could add years to your le.Running reverses the effects of ageing on your blood vessels, and even after a few goes runners have lower blood pressure than when they started.I’m about to run my first marathon at the ripe old age of , having built up the habit from a standing start.Here are some other good things running does:Weight will drop off you — I’m three stone lighter after taking it up two years ago. Your sleep cycle improves. Weirdly, you will have more energy. Your mental health will be better. It will spur you on to be healthy in other aspects of le.I get it, though. It’s easy to look at the swathe of runners and balk. Not a single thing about it looks fun.While some jammy gits manage to glide around the streets looking effortless, most of us look sweaty, out of breath and in deep, deep discomfort. Because we are.Most runners hate doing the actual running. Occasionally, on a nice balmy evening, you might forget you are five miles from home and the only way to get there is to keep running. But more often than not, you’re willing it to be over.No, most runners don’t run for the joyful act of running — we run for the sublime, borderline orgasmic feeling of having run.I sobered up more than two years ago, which would never have been a success had I not taken up running.I was a fastidious non-runner. I’d tried it, it was boring and it really, really hurt. But as those with addictive personalities know only too well, you have to swap drink with something. After Robbie Williams gave up cocaine he ensured Colombia still earned a few quid by necking up to  espressos a day.Like all men staring middle age in the face, I’d ignored any form of cardio exercise and instead spent a decade seeking the cliched T-shirt look.Abs that could give you a paper cut, biceps like grapefruits and whole hams for shoulders.All that cardio looked too much like hard work. And besides, you didn’t see Brad Pitt legging it round the park in Fight Club, did you Well as it turns out, the abs didn’t materialise and I just ended up feeling miserable. So when sobriety kicked in and I had a lot more time on my hands, I decided to see what running was about.My first go was an absolute tragedy and I am grateful no one witnessed me running a mere  yards before tripping over my dog. It was awful. I was wheezing and clutching my spare tyre, but I had broken the seal.Five minutes later I felt great. The dopamine and endorphins kicked in and I could have taken on the world, although my hamstrings said otherwise.Those  yards became  the next day and so on until I hit my first milestone — one whole kilometre. I was now officially hooked.Within two months I had completed my first Parkrun. Anyone who feels self-conscious about running should join their local Parkrun, as the sense of community and inclusion is fantastic.I’d shed a stone and felt utterly incredible — and I didn’t stop there. I now run more than  miles every week and in April I will take on my first London Marathon. I’m excited but also utterly terried.If you’re a non-runner, the thought of running is daunting.But trust me, aside from giving up smoking, it will be the most rewarding thing you’ll do for your body and mind. As well as the physical benefits it really, really sorts your head out.No social media, no people chasing work — it’s just you and your thoughts. I’ve had some of my best ideas and made some le-changing decisions running along the side of the Basingstoke canal.Just try it for a week. It’s completely free, unless you’re like me and treat it as an excuse to open up a whole new world of gadgetry.You can do it anywhere at any time you feel like it. And, crucially, you will never regret going for a run, ever.Put on any old pair of trainers, stick the headphones in, listen to a podcast, pick a landmark to run to and just go for it, as slowly as you need to. If it hurts, stop running and walk, then run again for a bit — and so on.This was me two years ago — and now Mo Farah had better be looking over his shoulder in April .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is impossible not to think that he has been influenced by his we, with her Calornian ideas.Perhaps they will have a happy new le but usually these unconventional moves made in the quest for private happiness and expression backfire.Prince Harry had so much going for him. It is hard not to imagine that he is throwing much of this away. I wonder what sort of le young Archie will have. I see confusion ahead.How far the couple will go in terms of dropping out of the limelight is unclear. They should pause and reflect hard before stepping over the precipice.Their intention to “work to become financially independent” will be interesting to watch.Where will this new money come from  Will Meghan cash in her global fame in Hollywood What a draw a Meghan Markle flick would be. Or, as many wags on social media joked last night, will she play herself in a future series of The Crown Or will she use her signicant clout on social media to “influence” for cold, hard cash Will there be endorsements  Will her lestyle blog The Tig — which once made her £k a year through sponsorships and endorsements — be resurrected But until this magical time of financial independence, presumably we will continue to pick up the bill, having already seen £.million of public money poured into their Frogmore Cottage home.And reports suggest taxpayers could continue to pay their £, annual security bill — eventhey were living in Canada.And what of the roughly £million a year Harry receives from the Queen’s taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant  How quickly will that go  Will it be phased out as third-party money rolls in And while she has many strings to her bow, what job will he do, an ex-Army man with two A levels to his name and no real world experience Rumours suggest he may become Governor-General of Canada. But the role, carrying out the Queen’s duties in Commonwealth nations, would be counterproductive for Harry, for several reasons.The role is seen as better to be held by a seasoned political figure, who knows the intricacies of the country and can perform a delicate balancing act. Nor would it give Harry and Meghan the anonymity hey appear to enjoy.And I suspect much of it would bore them to tears. So where did this breakaway come from  Royal insiders suggest the Sussexes have been sidelined by the Royal Family, hence their “many months of reflection and internal discussions” searching for a new way forward.So off to Canada they go. It has obvious appeal for them. American Meghan in particular loves it and spent seven years there while filming her TV drama Suits.And during their courtship Harry secretly jetted over to be with his beloved at her flat in Toronto.Harry and Meghan’s apparent antipathy towards le in Britain has clearly reached breaking point.There have been stories of imperious behaviour, rudeness to gardeners, allegations that Prince Harry had become isolated from his friends and was being integrated into more Calornian ways — flirting with veganism, yoga practice and so forth. These stories did not come from nowhere.Harry’s confidence to run his own affairs as he sees fit, regardless of the views of many seasoned family advisers, has left the royals resigned to him doing as he wants.One of the most signicant of Prince Harry’s many wars with the media could get nasty. He is determined to sue the Mail on Sunday over its sharing of letters from Meghan to her father, Thomas.Nobody in the family is publicly supporting his battle, which is seen as very ill advised, but he won’t be spoken to about it.Our source said: “The idea of Thomas Markle versus Meghan Markle in the High Court is horric but nobody can see any way of it being stopped.“The harm to the Royal Family could be catastrophic. Global headlines, and all of them damaging. It gives the impression our Royal Family is a dreadful soap opera.”Harry and Meghan have further issues. Unwisely, he confirmed a falling-out with his brother William in an interview in Africa with ITV journalist Tom Bradby.Meghan may have been told, and even believed, that William advised his brother not to marry her. Such things are not forgiven.Is there a sinister competition between the brothers  Certainly events haven’t helped that speculation. Take just last week.The only royal event in the calendar over New Year was William’s big environmental contest on New Year’s Day, a quiet period for news.His camp was “more than mfed” when the Sussexes released a rare photo of Harry with his young son Archie on New Year’s Eve — knocking William off the front pages. These things are meant to be choreographed, but it looked like they were competing.Royals overshadowing each other’s work in this way comes from a lack of co-ordination — itself an issue.Then Harry and Meghan were away for Christmas at Sandringham and not around when Prince Philip was in hospital. It did not play well and fed into the narrative that Harry and Meghan’s hearts and minds are where.Charles is known to want a more streamlined family with the focus on those in direct line of succession — he, William and George, shown with the Queen, appeared in an official portrait released last week.There was no need to step back from their duties, because this would liberate Harry and Meghan to concentrate on their own schemes, such as Sussex Royal.Last June they caused yet another stir when they left the Royal Foundation, the charitable organisation they shared with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.They have since trademarked the name Sussex Royal for their own activities, and are said to be planning to officially launch their new foundation in .Possibly the intelligent and articulate bride had seen her role as Prince Harry’s we as a  for advancing the causes she felt strongly about. But will she still be able to pursue this path in Canada There is a pertinent lesson in history here. Diana, Princess of Wales thought she could go it alone, having become a “royal” and “celebrity” figure in her own right.It was not an unqualied success.The nearest precedent to the bombshell is the abdication of Edward VIII in , in which a king laid down his throne to spend his le with the woman he loved.He announced he was quitting public le for ever, but was willing to help the new king “in a private station”his service was required.Unfortunately for him, his services were not required — except as Governor of the Bahamas and he became effectively an exile, living abroad, away from his country.Did this decision make him happy  No, I don’t believe it did. Just look at the sad, dead eyes of the Duke of Windsor in his s, who took what he perceived was the path of happiness instead of duty, and was miserable as a result.The most successful members of the Royal Family are those that work within the system. The Queen has been totally steadfast, and Prince Philip completely supportive.The role of members of the Royal Family is primarily to help the Queen. But I hear Meghan cry: “It’s not enough to just survive something, right “That’s not the point of le. You’ve got to thrive, you’ve got to feel happy.’”Canada it is, then.Dec : The Sun runs photos of couple on a London date.Nov : Kensington Palace announces engagement.

Medics at the Royal London Hospital decided Tafida’s condition was “end of le”.In October, NHS chiefs asked the High Court to rule that Tafida’s breathing tube should be taken out and the little girl allowed to die.But a judge decided her parents should be allowed to fly her to the Italian hospital where doctors believed she was not “end of le” — but needed more time for the brain to heal itself.Sun readers backed Tafida’s parents. It was the first time a UK court has allowed a child to be taken abroad against the wishes of the NHS.And yesterday doctors at the Gaslini Institute announced the news of Tafida’s improvement after just  weeks.Dr Andrea Moscatelli revealed she was “no longer in danger”.He said fluid on Tafida’s brain had been drained and doctors carried out a tracheotomy to assist her breathing.She also underwent a procedure to help with her eating.Dr Moscatelli explained these were all procedures which would hopefully prevent any long-term complications and eventually help her tohome.He added: “She has been stabilised from the neurological point of view and as a result her breathing has improved.“The little girl is able to breathe on her own.“We have been able to continue the programme of care as agreed with the High Court in London.‘’She can now move onto the next stage of treatment, which is not so intense, with the ultimate objective being able toher home to her family.“Elements that were troubling her have now been removed.’’Dad Mohammed, , from Plaistow, East London said: “The medical staff put Tafida on a buggy which means that, at last, she can be moved outside which was always our dream for her.”Construction consultant Mohammed, who is in the UK working, watched via a video call on his phone as Tafida was moved from the intensive care department to a nearby rehab unit.There she will receive the most advanced rehabilitation techniques and hydrotherapy to get her muscles moving again.Mohammed added: “For nearly a year she has been cooped up in a room. Now she is in a buggy, we will be able to take her outdoors and stimulate her brain.”The Gaslini hospital has its own beach — so Shelina and Mohammed will be able to take their daughter down to the sea to feel the water on her toes.Tafida arrived in Genoa on October  on board a private jet chartered by the hospital.The doctors said even then they were confident she would eventually be able to go home to be looked after by her family.Mohammed said yesterday: “There is still a long way to go but now she is out of intensive care we on the right path and going in the right direction.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Do I feel diminished, I wondered, very briefly Nah, I concluded, sod that. Good shot. And good riddance. I felt no more regret than when I squash a tick from my dog’s back.Soleimani was a vile man. He orchestrated terrorist attacks which caused death, misery and mayhem for millions across the Middle East and beyond.He was in Iraq planning attacks against our own forces as well as American ones. And he was doing so in the service of a country which has a pretty good claim to being the worst in the world — Iran.Hell, even North Korea can’t match Iran for its support of worldwide terrorism and the multiple murders in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Yemen.Iran is a pariah state, a thoroughly odious religious dictatorship, under which homosexuals are executed, Christians and Jews persecuted.Where there is no freedom of speech, no freedom of conscience, no freedom for women to wear what they want or do what they want.An economically wrecked Stone Age nest of barbarians whose government has spent the past  years waging war against anyone and everyone — but largely, it has to be said, other Muslim nations.Oh, and shoring up its malign influence across the whole of the wretched Middle East. And trying very hard to develop nuclear weapons so it can cause even more devastation — mainly to the area’s only democracy, our ally Israel.No wonder, then, that Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has a soft spot for Iran. It hates us — and therefore the deluded halfwit is on its side. Asked about the killing of Soleimani, he denounced the USand refused to accept that Soleimani was a terrorist.Meanwhile, so-called “experts” have been suggesting Donald Trump’s missile strike will increase tensions and could even lead to a Third World War.What rubbish. As my dad might have put it, Iran doesn’t have a pot to p**s in.The same experts were saying Iran would wait and carefully consider its options before launching some devastating attack. Wrong, wrong again.It waited about half an hour before lobbing a bunch of crap rockets at US bases, which killed no American soldiers at all, according to reports.I’m not in favour of getting involved in the Middle East’s politics, unless they are targeting our people or our interests.I was against the invasion of Iraq and against the bombing of Libya. Against our involvement in Syria, too.But here was a clear case where an agent from a hugely hostile foreign government was fomenting trouble in a country — Iraq — full of US and British troops.One missile got rid of him. Another might get rid of whoever takes his place. Countries such as Iran need to know that the tide has turned.

Brilliant.Meanwhile, Northern Trains is about to be stripped of its franchise. About time. The service I use looks like it was dug up from a disused railway line in Czechoslovakia in about . South Western Railway is in trouble, too.Here’s what to do. Take them into public ownership. It’s one of the few Labour policies that the public liked. And it would prove that this is a government which will act even when it’s against the Conservative instinct.And then scrap HS and spend the money on improving the rolling stock and infrastructure between our great northern cities.Sound like a plan, Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings ENJOYING the Labour leadership contest  Never has the party seemed so hilariously irrelevant.One of the frontrunners, Rebecca Long-Baileywas asked what she thought of Jeremy Corbyn’s election campaign. She said she gave it “ten out of ten”. And kept a straight face.The worst performance in  years. Rebecca, love, the people voted in just  Labour MPs. That means they gave Corbyn less than three out of ten for his campaign. Meanwhile, Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is hoping to be deputy leader. Heard of her  Nope, me neither.She has suggested we should have a Ministry of Fabulosity, where “fabulous MPs” think up “fabulous things”. She also suggested that instead of a debate, MPs could have a Strictly-style “dance-off, because we all love a boogie”.Is she six years old  Or just out of her brainbox on horse tranquilisers This is the party, remember, that gave Britain the National Health Service, welfare state and decent education. And its leadership is being contested by people with the combined IQ of a tub of BQ tile grout.Ha.The brilliant Russian comedian Konstantin Kisin has a good answer to that: “If the Russians had been involved in Brexit, it wouldn’t have taken more than three years. It would have been one meeting – we’re out. And we’d have taken a big chunk of France with us.”TERRIBLE news. The left-wing journalist Owen Jones has announced he will be cutting back dramatically on the time he spends talking utter b*****ks on Twitter.What on earth shall we all do  I hope the Government might set up a counselling service for those of us grief-stricken by Owen’s decision.He does have a point, mind. Twitter is a moronic institution. It reflects the views of a tiny proportion of the people and is largely filled with obsessive maniacs shrieking abuse at each other.Twitterstorms, as they call them, matter less than a handful of dust.They are just maniacs, from the left or right, desperate to be outraged.Do yourself an even bigger favour, Owen, and leave Twitter entirely.I CAN’T quite get into Veganuary. I’ve tried – I ate some peas the other night, for example.But I can’t be doing with the ious supplements vegans have to take to stop them dropping dead.Also, vegan sausages taste like the seat lining from a Toyota Corolla.Instead, then, I’ve decided to embrace Januhairy. This is where women stop shaving their front bottoms and end up with vast thickets of undergrowth in which deer and rabbits frolic with gay abandon.Now, I was never in the habit of shaving down near my old fella. Not least in case the razor slipped. But there’s plenty of surplus hair I did keep in check – poking out of my nostrils, hanging down from my ears and sprouting from my eye-brows. I’m going to leave all that alone for a month.Soyou see an overweight northerner coming towards you, who looks like a cross between Hagrid and Denis Healey, you’ll know it’s me.IT’S Bafta time again and of course there’s the usual moaning about a lack of ersity in the nominations. Why no black actors  Why no female directors The answer to these questions might be that on this occasion the judges reckoned the best performances came from actors who happened to be white, and directors who happened to be men.Equality does not mean every single thing in our lives should be made up of an equal proportion of black people, disabled people, gay people, women and so on.Some harridan even had a go at Margot Robbie because she was nominated twice and happens to be white. Get real, you race-obsessed bores.And good luck to the lovely Margot. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They want to act like glitzy American celebrities — I feel very sorry for the Queen. She’s an old woman and doesn’t want to upset her grandson.”Graham Smith, from pressure group Republic, called the statement crass and self-serving.He said: “This really is wanting to have your cake and eat it. They have said they will dip in and out of royal duties as it suits them but won’t stop taking public money until they find other sources of income.”“To suggest that they’re not already financially independent is incredibly crass and belies a sense of self-entitlement and a lack of self-awareness that is common among royals.“What should be more concerning is that the Royal Family’s star couple have effectively bowed out of their leading role and that raises questions about the monarchy’s future.“In the meantime taxpayers will rightly ask who will be funding their overseas lestyle, their extra security and trips back and forth between here and North America.“The monarchy needs to be asked serious questions about what they’re up to. It’s not good enough to be told to wait for clarication or to be left reading the tea leaves to work out what their intentions are.“The Queen and Prince Charles appear comfortable with all the trappings and formality of royal duties, but it’s increasingly clear that the younger generations are not so keen.”“The Royal Family is in trouble and with the next succession on the horizon their problems are only going to get worse.”Royal watchers say the couple’s bid for freedom has echoes of Edward VIII, who abdicated so he could be with twice-orced American Wallis Simpson in . But the Sussexes, just  months into their marriage, have been planning their move for some time.We told last year how they have quietly built up a commercial team in Hollywood, including Meghan’s former business manager and PR company Sunshine Sachs.However, the final straw appeared to be the official release of a new royal portrait featuring the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George.The insider said: “That picture was the clearest indication that Harry and Meghan are not considered part of the future of the institution. From their point of view, from that moment on there was no point hanging around.”And privately, courtiers were shocked at the “cavalier way” the couple were treating the Royal Family, especially the Queen.One said: “This is a very old and complicated institution which sits at the heart of this country, It’s naïve to think that you could untangle yourself from it in a number of days. It’s deeply unfair on the Queen to act this way.“Everything is up for discussion and nothing has been agreed. These discussions have been going on for a little more than a week.“Everyone is supportive of them wanting to do things dferently. But stating what you want to do before it’s been agreed by the Sovereign should not be a definite.”Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan pointed an accusing finger at the Duchess, writing on Twitter: “People say I’m too critical of Meghan Markle — but she ditched her family, ditched her Dad, ditched most of her old friends, split Harry from William and has now split him from the Royal ­Family. I rest my case.”The couple’s statement comes after a turbulent year in which they faced flak over the Frogmore Cottage renovations and claims of hypocrisy for campaigning over ­climate change while taking flights.They misled and upset royal fans with a bungled announcement of the arrival of son Archie in May.Ground down by the criticism, they used an ITV documentary to voice their disquiet, with Meghan saying she was struggling, and Harry revealing he and brother William were on “dferent paths”.Other members of the Royal Family were unhappy they appeared to be criticising the monarchy.The Queen, also rattled by favourite son Andrew’s shame over his ties to billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, spoke of her “bumpy year” in her Christmas message.In their statement, the couple insist they want to continue “to honour our duty to The Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages” and will raise their son “with an appreciation for the royal tradition”.But Ms Seward added: “Of course this is history repeating itself from nearly  years ago when another American made her husband chose between her and the Royal Family.“Within  months of marrying Meghan, Harry is walking away from both his job and his family.”HARRY and Meghan have cost more than £million since they became a couple.That vast figure reflects a lestyle that few husbands and wives would be capable of funding themselves.Overseas tours have cost enormous sums — and the wedding in May  cost £million alone.Frogmore Cottage, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s official residence, had a taxpayer-funded £.million renovation in the summer. And round-the-clock security for the home in Windsor is believed to cost £, a year.The couple paid up to £, for a holiday to Ibiza in August — and were criticised for using private jets. It is reported that they spent £, throughout Meghan’s pregnancy — including £, on maternity clothes and a further £, on a baby shower.Their -day tour through Australia, Fiji and Tonga in October  cost £, — and their trip to South Africa in the autumn is believed to have cost a similar amount.The Prince of Wales paid £, to fund the public duties of Harry and Meghan and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.Royal accounts showed that Charles’s bill for Harry and Meghan and Wills and Kate, plus some other expenditure, came to £.million last year. That was up from £.million in -.The Sussexes have now revealed that they plan on becoming “financially independent.” That would mean they no longer receive funding from the Sovereign Grant — the money paid annually to the monarchy by the UK Government.PRINCE Harry and Meghan could pocket a packet as the “biggest Instagram influencers on the planet”.Multi-national firms would pay big to get the couple to promote their brands to their ten million followers.Social media expert Paul Sutton said: “They could make millions.

Insiders warned their ­decision will have a major effect on the Royal Family, who it is claimed were kept in the dark. One source said: “Make no mistake this is utterly ­unprecedented in the manner of how Harry and Meghan have gone about this. By not informing the Queen, Prince Charles or any other senior royals they are showing complete ­disregard for the institution. “This will have huge implications for their future, their relationship with the family and the public who will have very mixed views. It will have a ­monumental effect on the entire family and their standing in it.” Palace aides last night refused to deny the couple would continue to receive millions of pounds in funding from Prince Charles’s own Duchy of Cornwall finances. One said: ­“Discussions with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage. “We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.”  Harry has a reported fortune of £million while Meghan is ­understood to be worth around £million from her time as a TV actress. The couple’s move follows weeks of speculation about their future after they took an extended break from royal duties over the festive period. They spent Christmas at an £million property in Canada while the rest of the royals ­gathered at Sandringham. The pair announced they would give up future funds from the ­Sovereign Grant – which they used to renovate their home at a cost £.million. This enables them to cash in and pursue private ventures potentially worth millions of pounds around the globe. Announcing their decision to quit, Harry, , and -year-old Meghan said: “After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution. We intend to step back as ‘senior’ members of the Royal Family, and work to become financially ­independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen.“We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America.” It comes as the pair had claimed they were going to become more eco-friendly amid criticism of their trips on board private jets. Sources suggested the move will now allow Harry and Meghan to monetise their royal ­connections on both sides of the Atlantic by ­shedding criticism of receiving public money to fund their lavish lestyles. Former Kensington MP Emma Dent-Coad questioned what the wealthy couple meant by being ­financially independent. She said: “Given that they’re both millionaires, I’m not sure what they mean. Are they stepping back from the family, or just the job  “And are they going to leave it all behind  If so, I’d like to go to their garage sale. Perhaps some of their family might like to follow them.”  Harry and Meghan said they would continue “to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages”, but palace insiders were last night at a complete loss to explain how it will work. It is likely they will be spending their time in Canada when not in the UK and may travel to America, Meghan’s homeland and where her mother lives. Any move to the country, even for a period of the year, would throw up important questions about the couple’s long-term future within the Royal Family.  Security for the couple would also be an issue, and as Canada is a realm – a country where the Queen is head of state – it may have to pay for keeping the couple and eight-month-old Archie safe. Their bid to be financially independent could point towards them seeking a job, or a paid role with an organisation whose aims complement their own beliefs. Other members of the family who have salaried jobs include the Queen’s grandchildren Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie and Peter Phillips.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailItaposs been bugging me for ages, but Iaposve finally realised who Meghan Markle reminds me of.Itaposs Diane Keaton in The Godfather - the pretty ingenue who watches the man she loves be consumed by the all-powerful family business he always hated.The Royals have an awful lot in common with the Corleones. Both families enjoy immense wealth, but are forced to live in private compounds to avoid scrutiny.Their families and friends become their bodyguards, keeping their secrets and taking to the mattresses with them in times of trouble.The head of the family demands you swear an oath of loyalty, and everyone is kept in line by the consigliere or top courtier. Every son establishes their own court of supporters, who engage in power struggles with their siblings and parents.And legal issues can be an unwelcome intrusion, even on the day of a daughteraposs wedding. And there are rules that must be followed. You can do pretty much anything, run a casino badly, go bankrupt, get your toes sucked, have affairs. The worst crime is to go against the family, and the greatest punishment is exile. Perhaps Harry promised Meghan that within  years theyaposd have reformed the Royals to the extent they could be legitimate philanthropists. But in this family there are rigid lines of inheritance, and the next leader is always chosen in strict uterine order . As sixth in line to the throne, Harry is on course to become ever less-powerful in the family business. They wonapost be able to reform anything. But he, Meghan and Archie will, nevertheless, still have to follow all the rules.  When Harry married Meghan she, like Keatonaposs character Kay Adams, probably thought things would be dferent. That together they could reform an old-fashioned institution, and do something good with all that wealth and power.And theyaposve done their best. The Invictus games, the Grenfell tower cookbook, Harryaposs landmine campaign, Meghanaposs Smart Works clothing line helping poorer women into work, and her inspiration to others as a woman of colour.Heck, I was delighted just by her decision to walk down the aisle alone. Marriages are not about property being exchanged between men, but adults making a choice to walk alongside each other. If more people realised that, thereaposd be much less heartache in the world. No doubt Meghan and Harry wanted to continue his motheraposs work as a high-profile charitable campaigner. But they forgot one thing - she only ever came into her own when she left.  Once youaposre in The Firm, your friends have a path to wealth and fame by association, as well as hate and abuse. You have immense pressure, media attention, and political responsibilities.It becomes a matter of crucial national importance as to whether you are wearing a hat, and what this means for the monarchy. People discuss, at , what jewellery one of the outlaws wears to an event you both attend. Every word you speak, glance you throw, or pair of socks you put on has more ramications than an opening gambit in D chess.Youaposre not a person, when youaposre Royal. Youaposre a role. And Harry doesnapost have much of one any more.  So the best this well-intentioned, angst-ridden, slightly-uptight couple can do is to become like George and Amal Clooney - immensely wealthy and intensely secluded, with occasional forays into the public eye to do good or promote a cause, while raising their family in private. Theyaposd still be in a gilded cage, but itaposs one where - George and Amal may assure them - fewer rocks will be thrown at them.And perhaps Harry imagines that this way, they can remain friends with the family. There is no betrayal, no squealing to the feds, no abdication and subsequent exile. You can still go home for birthdays.But it takes only one ill-advised deal with a casino boss, plastic surgeon or drug gang kingpin and trouble would kick off again. Because, like the Corleones, you can never really leave this family.For all of us, it is ma fia - the nationaposs family. We watch their squabbles and compare them with our own. For centuries their character has had an impact on our history, and as long as Royals exist that obsession will not be easily dropped.Harry and Meghan could renounce everthing, and retire to a hut in Snowdonia, and thereaposd still be people with cameraphones. As millionaire philanthropists, they still wonapost be the Clooneys - every utterance will be interpreted through the lens of protocol and family politics. Meghan could neverto acting, because sheaposll never be able to convince an audience sheaposs anything but a princess.No matter how peripheral they become, there is still a potential for international diplomatic incidents. Just ask Uncle Andrew for details.Of course, itaposs unlikely the Queen would allow a polo pony to be slaughtered just to make a point, but itaposs still possible for a former Royal to wind up sleeping with the fishes.If Princess Diana had retained Royal levels of security after her orce, she would never have died in that underpass. The promise of protection, and the threat of removing it, is exactly how the mafia has always operated. For Harry and Meghan itaposs not a choice of which country to live in, or what rich friends to hang out with. They have to pick their poison.The th in line to the throne can become low-profile, stay wealthy, and become ever-less scrutinised the further they move down the line of succession with every subsequent birth. But that takes time, and patience. Radical change has never worked for the monarchy or the mob. Both focus on long-term survival. Harry and Meghanaposs instinct may well be to get out, in the interests of quick and immediate happiness. But as Michael Corleone discovered,you want to change the family you need to stay in it. Andyou stay in it, the family changes you. Itaposs best not to join in the first place.

Although they plan on aposstepping backapos as senior royals, the Duke and Duchess will still be members of the Royal Famiy.

Harry and Meghan’s decision to resign from their roles is without precedent – their decision to not tell the Queen or other senior royals, astonishing. This has been bubbling under the surface for quite some time but no one would have expected the ruthlessness of the announcement. With the declaration they are quitting their current roles with the family, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex say they are looking forward to their financial independence. And no wonder. PR gurus have suggested they will be able to exploit their royal connections to the tune of millions of pounds each year, in truth the sky’s the limit. Well-placed sources have told me the couple want to “become one of the most influential double acts on the planet” - but no one is quite clear what the plan is. Harry and Meghan have suggested that by not taking the handout of the Sovereign Grant they will be free to do what they want, free from criticism and free to sign mega deals with global corporations.  If that turns out to be the case, they should start by paying British taxpayers back nearly £million they forked out to do up Harry and Meghan’s lavish home, while the pair of them are millionaires in their own right. The two-line statement from Buckingham Palace last night that included “these are complicated issues that will take time to work through”, paints a grim picture.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussexaposs took time out over the festive period after a tough year in the public eye. Now, the ITV News At Ten anchor Tom Bradby said it was no secret that they could leave the UK to start a le abroad. His comments follow speculation the couple are considering basing themselves in the Commonwealth country for part of this year. The Sun reported the couple are due to meet senior royals in the coming days to discuss the plans which could include the long-term proposal to move their office to the country or even relinquish their His and Her Royal Highness titles. Mr Bradby interviewed the couple for a documentary last year where they highlighted the pressures they have faced and Harry talked about his rt with his brother, the Duke of Cambridge.Appearing on ITVaposs Good Morning Britain show, the news anchor said about Meghan and Harry: I think the truth is thereaposs a lot, I think, going on, thereaposs a lot going on within the royal family and I donapost know - and Iaposm not sure they know - what their future is going to be and what their position is... Asked about the claims by the Sun the couple are considering spending more time in Canada, Mr Bradby replied: I donapost know the answer to that. Itaposs no big secret in their friends that they have been considering their options in the future. He added: I donapost ask what their plans are and they keep that pretty close to their chest and understandably so. I donapost think itaposs a done deal, that would be my impression. I think thereaposs a lot of talking to be done, there are a million possibilities, they could go to Canada. Any move to Canada, even for a period of the year, would throw up important questions about Meghan and Harryaposs future within the royal family.  All members of the monarchy carry out their public duties in support of the Queen and they would likely have to take part in official events in Canada. The cost of security for the couple would also be an issue, and as Canada is a realm, a country where the Queen is head of state, it may have to pay for keeping the couple and their son Archie safe. Meghan, a former actress, lived and worked in Toronto during her time starring in the popular US drama Suits, and the couple were famously pictured together when Meghan joined her then-boyfriend Harry at the  Invictus Games in the city. The duke and duchess visited Canadaaposs High Commission in central London on Tuesday to thank Canadians for what Harry described as the unbelievable welcome they received while in the Commonwealth country for around six weeks.

By withdrawing from the sovereign grant, the Sussexes have paved the way to bank a fortune. No longer bound by royal work, Harry and Meghan are free for commercial deals that could include lucrative sponsorships. US public relations guru Ronn Torossian said they could get “any endorsement deals in the world they may want”. The CEO of New York-based PR firm WPR told the Mirror: “This news, while surprising to many, should not come as such a shock given that the clues were there for months. “Many will see this as Harry abandoning the family, with increased irritation by taxpayers with royal spending and, of course, Prince Andrew’s ongoing scandal. The Royal Family is scarred right now, but not out for the count. Their legacy is much larger than just Meghan and Harry.“That said, I think Meghan Markle will remain a huge superstar.“Whether this will give Meghan and Harry the lower profile they seem to crave remains to be seen. “They will have to be vigilant in maintaining their privacy, as well as ensure that their new charitable focus is well-received by the public. “While this is a blow to the reputation of the Royal Family, their legacy is intact and will outlast Meghan and Harry.” A well-placed royal source said: “Harry and Meghan have clearly set their sights on becoming one of the most famous and influential couples in the world.  “They clearly value their global appeal more than the institution of the Royal Family and have no doubt been advised they can turn their royal connections into a private enterprise. “The jury is out to see how this will fare with public opinion in the United Kingdom, which is probably why they are choosing to ide their time between Harry’s home and America.” Ever since walking down the aisle at Windsor Castle in May , the pair have struggled intensely with being the world’s most photographed couple. As they navigated public le, both became embroiled in a never-ending stream of negative stories, including a much-publicised rt between Harry and his brother William. Swapping Hollywood for royal le has been particularly tough on Meghan. The former actress, , first sparked rumours they could be about to step out of the spotlight when she revealed she struggled to cope with pregnancy and the early stages of motherhood.In an emotional confession to ITV’s Tom Bradby last October on her and Prince Harry ’s ten-day tour of Africa, she said the glare of the spotlight had made things more dficult at a time when she was “really vulnerable”. Meghan told Bradby it was a “very real thing to be going through behind the scenes” and, asked whether it had “really been a struggle”, replied: “Yes.” The tour, which ran from the end of September to early October, was unusual for a statement by Prince Harry, , in which he accused parts of the media of carrying out a “ruthless campaign” against his we. The Duke of Sussex’s public statement was issued on the couple’s website on October  as it was announced Meghan was suing a Sunday newspaper for publishing a private letter she had written to her father. Although the move to spend part of the year in North America takes the couple out of daily contact with the royals, it brings Meghan closer to her Calornia-based mother Doria Ragland. The couple’s arrival across the Atlantic could also pave the way for a reconciliation with her father, Thomas Markle, , who the Duchess has not spoken to since she wed.

Her amazing achievement has seen her slim from st lb to st lb, losing st lb to drop from a size  to a . Even Nicola doubted she’d manage it when she walked into Slimming World  months ago. But with only two stone to go until she hits her target, the mum of two is happy to be on the home straight. She says: “If someone had told me in just over a year I could have lost all this, I’d never have believed them.  I do still get surprised when I look in the mirror and see the new me, or when I try on smaller clothes. I feel like I’m finally starting to live again.” Insurance claims manager Nicola, , who’s ft in, had never struggled with her weight when she was younger and was maintaining her usual size  frame after losing baby weight she gained in  when she had daughter Rachel, now .

She says: “I’d always avoid having my picture taken but at my wedding I couldn’t. I hated being self-conscious.” In a typical day, Nicola, from Bearsden, near Glasgow, would skip breakfast and have chocolate from the work vending machine. At lunch, she’d have sandwiches followed by more chocolate and crisps. At home, dinners were cheesy pasta ready meals or takeaway pizza. Evenings in front of the TV involved more snacks. As her weight escalated, so did her health problems. “I’m asthmatic and I was becoming dependent on my inhaler. I also had permanent heartburn . The tipping point, though, was when I got chest pains. I thought I was having a heart attack. My son is only eight – he needs me to be healthy.” Nicola got a shock when she saw her starting weight –   st lb – at Elaine  - Doyle’s Clydebank Slimming World group. But after losing a steady -lb a week, in a month she’d dropped a stone. She says: “Staying to the group after the weigh-in made a dference. I’d struggled to lose weight before, but this was dferent. I had phenomenal support from my fellow members.” "},{"url":null,"title":"queen dropped clue meghan markle","story":"NewsQueen dropped clue about Meghan Markle and Prince Harrys plans in Christmas speechMeghan Markle and Prince Harry have announced they are stepping back as senior members of the Royal Family, but some fans think the Queen gave the game away last monthShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video duke-duchess-sussex-visited-canada-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news queen-dropped-clue-meghan-markle-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - Royal FamilySubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Britain is preparing to evacuate thousands of UK citizens from the Middle East as experts fear the threat of war is far from over as Iran is expected to direct its proxy militias in the region to carry out more bloodshed. More than , Brits will fly home from Lebanon alone as Iran has a large contingent of Hezbollah supporters there. The Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel to the country. Embassies throughout the world remain on high-alert against attacks and are protected by increased security. Not only are local forces loyal to Iran a threat, but there are armed groups with links to Iran throughout the whole of Asia and that are also a threat in South America and Africa. The proxies could be anything from State supporters like the Shia sect Assad regime in Syria to Shia militia groups throughout Iraq and Syria, who are heavily-armed and supported by Iran. There are also Lebanese Hezbollah groups, funded by Iran as well as the Popular Mobilisation Units, which comprise of more than  mostly Shia militia groups. A senior British security source told the Mirror: “The whole region remains a powder keg. Lebanon is very tense and could quickly erupt as Iran urges its proxies to take action, militants are generating hatred across the country.  “We have a team ready to fly out and scope out how we would extract people. “The priority is to locate available ships or ferries that we can hire and get into Lebanon and transit people to Cyprus.” A similar operation was carried out in  during a war between Hezbollah and Israel. However, influential Iraqi Shi’ite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr yesterday called on militia groups not to carry out attacks. He said: “I call on the Iraqi factions to be deliberate, patient, and not to start military actions, and to shut down the extremist voices of some rogue elements until all political, methods have been exhausted.”US President Donald Trump yesterday boasted that “Iran appeared to be standing down” .He revealed that no Americans were killed or injured as Tehran fired ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq.  Most were aimed at the al-Assad base, some  miles west of Baghdad and two hitting a target in Erbil, north Iraq. Two rockets fell inside Baghdad’s heavily fortied Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign missions, but caused no casualties. The attacks were in response to the killing of the Iranian’s top General Qasem Suleimani by the US last week. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the missile attacks were a “slap on the face” of the US and demanded US troops leave Iraq. In an address at The White House, Mr Trump said: “As long as I’m President Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. For far too long, all the way back to , nations have tolerated Iran’s destructive behaviour in the Middle East and beyond. “Those days are over. Iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism, and their pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens the civilised world.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uber driver cleared palace sword","story":"NewsUber driver cleared of palace sword attack caught in tourist hot spot terror plotMohiussunnath Chowdhury, of Luton, Bedfordshire, appeared in Woolwich Crown Court accused of terrorism related offences targeting famous London landmarks including Madame TussaudsShareByHelen William:,  JAN NewsMohiussunnath Chowdhury at the Old Bailey in June  \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - Royal FamilySubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Mohiussunnath Chowdhury, , was motivated by dreams of martyrdom for the cause of Islam, and inspired by preachers of hate like former al-Qaeda spokesman Anwar Al-Awlaki, prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC said. The lawyer told a jury at Londonaposs Woolwich Crown Court that Chowdhury had been found not guilty at the Old Bailey of a terror charge after attacking police officers with a sword outside Buckingham Palace in August . In that incident, two unarmed officers suffered cuts to their hands when they fought to disarm him near the Queenaposs London residence as Chowdhury shouted repeatedly Allahu Akbar .  After he was cleared at the Old Bailey, Chowdhury was driven by dreams of martyrdom, the court heard. By  he was planning to kill members of the public at busy tourist hotspots such as Londonaposs Madame Tussauds and the Gay Pride parade, according to Mr Atkinson. But Chowdhury was unwittingly confiding his plans to undercover police officers who had him under surveillance, the court heard. Mr Atkinson said: Believing them to be as sincerely committed as he was, he told them of his devotion to the cause of violent Islamic extremism, the basis for this devotion and the skewed religious beliefs that underpinned it. Mr Atkinson added: Various potential targets were discussed between the defendant and those he believed to be committed to the same cause and the same forms of violence as himself. The targets mentioned included Madame Tussauds in London, the Gay Pride parade and an attack on tourists on a London open-top tour bus. The object was to unleash death and suffering on non-Muslim members of the public who happened to be present, using a firearm, sword and even a van as part of an attack. Mr Atkinson said Chowdhury even bragged he had deceived the jury which cleared him at his previous trial. The prosecutor told jurors they could consider Chowdhuryaposs assertions to the undercover officers that he was indeed trying to carry out a terrorist attack in  and that he had deceived the earlier jury that acquitted him of it. Mr Atkinson added: Whatever the position in , he was unquestionably preparing for terrorism in . Mr Atkinson said Chowdhuryaposs sister Sneha Chowdhury, , had better reason than anyone to understand what her brother was thinking and wanting to achieve, but she did nothing to stop him.  After being cleared in December , Chowdhury posted an Instagram message in which the police officer who had confronted and disarmed him outside Buckingham Palace was described as a cuck. From January , three undercover officers were working to earn Chowdhuryaposs trust and to tap into his extremist views, the court heard. Chowdhury was able to buy a replica Glock gun and told them what he was planning to do and why.  Mr Atkinson said: He told them of his training regime, and sought to involve them in his firearms-related training. He told them of what he was wanting and planning to do, and sought to involve them in the carrying out of one or more terrorist attacks. Chowdhury had claimed the incident outside Buckingham Palace had been an attempt at suicide and it was not an attack. In the lead-up to this incident he had made references on WhatsApp to the Westminster jihad attackerapos Khalid Masood, who had killed six people. He noted that Masood had been shot by police and said that he stood up to the bastards.

A week before Christmas, the firm announced , Hotpoint and Indesit machines had faulty door locks that could lead them to overheat and catch fire. Whirlpool, which recalled tumble dryers over fire fears earlier last year, advised people with affected washing machine models to stop using them. As their recall finally gets under way tomorrow, Which  is calling for Whirlpool to reimburse people who felt they had no option but to pay for replacement machines. And it voiced “serious concerns” that people will be left with potentially dangerous machines for months as they wait for an engineer to fix or replace them. Which  called on Whirlpool “to do the right thing” and offer refunds, but the company tonight refused to bow to pressure and said engineer appointments would begin on Monday. It said repair or replacement was “the most effective means of removing this risk” and said it was following “industry best-practice procedures” for the UK. It added: “Whirlpool has been able to reassure % of [customers] they do not have an affected appliance and can continue to use their products safely as normal.”  More than  MPs have written to Whirlpool about fears over the recall. Labour MP Rachel Reeves said: “If they cannot swtly fix or replace machines with potential problems, they should offer affected customers a full refund.” Whirlpool customers told Which  how they had to dig into savings to buy new machines or do their laundry at friends’ and relatives’ homes, or launderettes. By Sue Davies - Which  Head of Consumer Production Whirlpool will finally launch its recall of more than half a million fire-risk washing machines tomorrow. The move will bring some relief to hundreds of thousands of customers who have already faced weeks of inconvenience and racking up huge bills at the launderette. But the bad news is that the company’s offer of a repair or replacement machine - but no refund - could leave many facing months of waiting, without any way to wash their clothes. This approach is all too typical for the American appliance giant - a company that has earned a reputation for shoddy products and even shoddier treatment of its British customers. Whirlpool broke the news of a potentially lethal door switch fault days before Christmas - the worst possible time for families preparing to host friends and relatives. Alarmingly, the consumers put at risk by this defect were told nearly two months after Whirlpool first warned its wealthy investors in the US about a possible safety issue with some washing machines, which they were assessing. Over the festive break, Which  was fielding concerns from customers struggling to get by without a washing machine or seeking reliable information about the recall. In some cases these customers had found it dficult to establishtheir Hotpoint or Indesit washer was one of those affected after a  start on Whirlpool’s first attempt to warn consumers of this threat to their safety - with a website that crashed on day one. Others found it impossible to get through to a phone helpline, even after trying to call dozens of times. Many people were confused by conflicting information about whether or not it was safe to use their machine. Whirlpool said yes - but only at C. The government’s Office for Product Safety and Standards seemed to say no - unplug your machine. Who to believe  Joanne Braithwaite, from Stanford-le-Hope in Essex, told us she had no alternative but to keep using her machine at a lower setting and said that is just not practical for a family of four - and to make matters worse, her Whirlpool tumble dryer has since packed in as well. Those who have understandably chosen to take no risks and turned their machines off are having a miserable time too. Some families are taking matters into their own hands and forking out for a new washing machine themselves - not an option available to everyone, of course. Many have echoed the view of Fiona Thompson, , who branded Whirlpool “an absolute disgrace” and said she would never have one of the company’s products in her home again. Following on from the tumble dryer fire scandal which resulted in another recall last year, the reality is that many British consumers have lost faith in what they see as a tainted brand. Whirlpool needs to do the right thing and offer refunds to these people - and to those who simply can not afford to wait for many weeks or months for a repair or replacement. The company says it is aiming to deal with registered machines in a matter of weeks. But with tumble dryers, we found a quarter of customers were being told they would have to wait more than six months for a repair.That can’t be repeated with an essential appliance like a washing machine. People need the money to put towards a new machine now. MPs including Labour’s Rachel Reeves - who chaired Parliament’s influential Business Committee when it produced a damning report last year into Whirlpool’s handling of the ongoing tumble dryer saga - have also called for refunds or compensation for customers. The one consolation for the majority of those affected is that they have been spared the horror of a house fire caused by a faulty appliance. Not everyone has been so lucky. Whirlpool says  fires have been linked to this fault, which causes a machine’s door-locking mechanism to overheat - the latest in a series of safety scandals. Previously, a coroner blamed an electrical fault with the door switch of a Hotpoint tumble dryer for a  fire in north Wales that killed two men - Bernard Hender, , and Doug McTavish, . Meanwhile, the fire-risk heating element fault affecting . million tumble dryers has been linked to more than  fires and Whirlpool only agreed to launch a full recall after years of pressure from organisations like Which  and newspapers like The Mirror.The company was shamed in Parliament for using “chilling” tactics including gagging orders that prevented fire victims from speaking out about the danger. Shockingly, all this means that right now there may well be more than a million potentially lethal Whirlpool products in people’s homes. Something stinks about this situation - and it’s not just the piles of festering laundry lying around the homes of thousands of frustrated washing machine owners. The product safety system in this country is rotten to the core - failing time and again to put public safety ahead of business interests. This latest safety scare should be a wake-up call that brings about a much needed overhaul of consumer protections in this country. There must be a full, transparent investigation into this latest washing machine fault - including what Whirlpool knew and when - to establish what is going wrong with the system. And, as a first step to restoring public confidence, the government’s failing Office for Product Safety and Standards must be replaced. British consumers deserve a truly independent regulator with real powers to stand up to the might of global corporations and ensure dangerous products are kept out of people’s homes."},{"url":null,"title":"what happen line succession meghan","story":"NewsWhat will happen to line of succession now that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have quitMeghan Markle and Prince Harry are stepping down from their roles as senior royals, but what it mean for the rest of the Royal FamilyShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  JAN News \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - Royal FamilySubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

So what will happen to Harry and Archieaposs position on the list now that the couple have quit  In short, not a lot. Even though Meghan and Harry have said they will step back from their royal duties, this wonapost lead to a chance in the line of succession. The positioning is based on the legislation, and it the Government would have to step in to kick someone off the list.  Historian and author Marlene Koenig told Royal Central: Succession to the throne is based on legislation including the Succession to the crown Act, which includes the Act of Settlement.

Stephanie Muller, , wants to raise awareness of a medical condition that left her unable to consummate her marriage for two years. Stephanie and -year-old new husband Andrew decided they would wait to have sex until they wed after meeting at their local church in New York in . The couple became an item in  and courted for two years before tying the knot in May . However, on their honeymoon, attempts to have sex where thwarted when they found penetration too dficult. Stephanie ended up with a severe yeast infection which medication failed to clear up over a three-month period. During that time she found having a pelvic exam so painful that she ended up in tears and shaken. Once the infection cleared up they tried again to no avail and she said the couple ended up feeling like roommates. They eventually discovered what was at the root of the problem in January  when Stephanie was diagnosed with vaginismus by her gynaecologist. The condition results in Stephanieaposs vagina tightening up when the couple attempt to have intercourse. Stephanie said: Saving sex for my wedding night was my personal choice. I wanted to save sex for my wedding night because I didn’t want to have sex with anyone that wasn’t my husband.  I personally believe that sex is a very intimate and special thing, and I didn’t want to share that with someone  that I would not end up marrying. Stephanie said she felt ashamed that she wasn’t able to have sex with her husband and it made her feel like they were friends. My husband and I have talked about how vaginismus really de-sexualised our relationship it was almost like living with a roommate, she said. We would even be careful about other physical things because neither of us wanted to suggest trying to have sex, be disappointed, and the night ending in tears.Stephanie was referred to the Vaginismus and Women’s Therapy Centre but this would not be covered by her health insurance. So instead she was prescribed her with Vicodin, a medicine used to relieve moderate to severe pain, to have sex with her husband. In September  Stephanie looked at other things she could do and the couple decided not to let her condition affect their intimacy.  In January last year the couple undertook a five-month treatment course at Womenaposs Therapy Centre in Plainview, New York, that the break through happened and Stephanie is now healed. She said: Having vaginismus is a heavyweight, and what largely makes it so dficult is the isolation and shame that comes with it. My husband has been incredibly supportive throughout my journey with vaginismus."},{"url":null,"title":"mum gives birth two sets","story":"NewsMum gives birth to two sets of twins in a year as kind strangers offer financial helpAlexzandria Wolliston welcomed Mark and Malakhi in March  before doctors informed her she was once again pregnant with twins just weeks afterShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  JAN NewsAlexzandria with her second set of twins Kaylen and Kaleb - who were born in December\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The two flight recorders could reveal why the airliner came down in flames so soon after Iran’s ballistic missile strike against US troops. Mystery has surrounded the disaster as the Boeing  was seen in unveried video burning while in mid-air after taking off from Iran’s main Imam Khomeini airport. There were  passengers and nine crew members on the Ukraine International Airlines flight PS to Kiev when it crashed. The plane’s black boxes have been recovered, but the head of civil aviation in Tehran, Ali Abedzadeh, refused to hand them over to Boeing. The Ukrainian embassy in Iran initially issued a statement saying: “According to preliminary data, the plane crashed due to engine failure for technical reasons. As of now, versions of terrorist attack or missile attack are ruled out.” However, that claim was later deleted from the embassy’s website. Any previous comments about the cause were “not official”, the embassy said. A video on state media appeared to show the plane already on fire as it fell from the night sky.  Askedthe airliner could have been downed by a missile, Ukraine’s Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk cautioned against speculation.

Ideally, we’ve got to be finishing second,” he said.“It takes out that extra two games in the play-offs and that’s where we want to be, that’s what we’re looking towards and realistically we’ve got the squad to do that.“We’ve got to look to win every game and it’s down to us really.

There’s no point looking at anybody , each week we don’t look at other results thinking ‘whatwe do this and that’ we just focus on our own performances and how we’re going to beat teams.“We need to start getting three points on the board again.”Ending their four-match unbeaten run, particularly after a morale-boosting derby draw the weekend previous, with a loss against the Caley Jags stung for Dundee and Hamilton.And the -year-old is determined to put that right as soon as possible with three points when third-placed Ayr United come to town on Saturday.The former Hearts man added: “It was really disappointing off the back of a good run of games and it just wasn’t acceptable.“We started sloppy and it just continued throughout.

There is plenty of bacon in Aberdeen # this will help grocers tremendously.”As war rumbled on, eventually most foods were covered by rationing with the exception of fruit and vegetables which citizens were encouraged to grow.The famous “Dig for Victory” campaign was spearheaded by Aberdeen man John Raeburn who was head of the agricultural branch at the Ministry of Food.Born in the city and educated at Mile End School before his family moved to Manchester, Prof Raeburn specialised in agricultural economics and joined the Government when war broke out.His branch was responsible for uniting a struggling nation in what was considered one of the most successful home front initiatives, inspiring millions to dig up lawns and public spaces."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/5e158db082e802.14274742-940x473.jpg ","title":"end of an era as aecc arena be flattened","story":"Work to knock down Aberdeen#s former exhibition centre is expected to begin in the coming weeks.Aberdeen City Council submitted a building warrant to demolish existing buildings at the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centrein Bridge of Don, alongside agents Fairhurst.The site is no longer in use following the opening of the PJ Live arena in August last year.The multi-million-pound state-of-the-art event complex, which is in Bucksburn, now hosts all major events. vw, px\"  The AECC first opened its doors in  and comprised of conference facilities and a multi-purpose arena.It has now been permanently closed.A building warrant was submitted in September to demolish buildings at the site including the main arena, which has now been approved by the local authority.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden said now the building warrant has been granted, the “intention” would be for that work to start “immediately”.He added: “That might include internal works first which people won’t be able to see.”As well as the removal of the old main arena building, the covered walkway that connects to the section of the conference centre next to the Holiday Inn Express will also be removed.It is expected that the value of the work to be undertaken will be around £,.The warrant has an expiry date of January   and all work must be completed by then.It is understood that the remaining conference centre will be retained as well as the nearby park-and-ride facility.Talks regarding the future use of the site are still ongoing.Plans were previously submitted to the local authority by developers Henry Boot in May  for the land, which hoped to create a mixed use development including approximately  residential units, properties for commercial and business use, a recycling centre and park-and-ride facility.The application is still pending and there was a number of documents uploaded on to the site in , along with a letter of objection received last year.It stated: “The site would have been better used as a new north-east HQ and training hub for Police Scotland with Queen Street being disposed of.“There would be ample space to create a specialist training facility, which Police Scotland does not have anywhere north of the central belt.”Discussions have also been under way with the King’s Community Church over the site, with the church keen to move from its base on King Street.The church began in  with a small gathering before it moved to the city centre church in  where it has remained.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: “A building warrant to demolish the arena at the old AECC and a covered walkway to the adjacent hotel has been approved by the planning authority.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/5e158dbdac3c26.69409016-375x564.jpg ","title":"getting home would mean the world to me and my family says aberdeen cricketer solo nqweni","story":"An Aberdeen cricket star struck down by a rare illness while in the north-east has admitted he felt like a prisoner in his own body – but is aiming to recover for the sake of his family.Solo Nqweni, , moved to the area last April to play for Aberdeenshire Cricket Club.In July he began feeling unwell and put it down to a virus.But days later he had been put in an induced coma after being diagnosed with Guillain Barre syndrome, a serious autoimmune disorder which affects the nervous system.It left Solo unable to walk, talk or even breathe unaided.Appeal to help Aberdeen cricketer fighting Guillain Barre syndrome fly home\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news local appeal-help-aberdeen-cricketer-fighting-guillain-barre-syndrome-fly-home embed #

I’ve got a son, who is eight months old.“I came to Aberdeen to build my cricketing career and provide for my family.“Although I have had the support of my family being able to come to see me, it’s not the same as being at home, around my family and friends and being able to build that relationship with my son.“Going home to do my rehab and get strong to the point where I can walk again would mean the world to me and my family and friends.”Since he fell ill in July, Solo’s family have been making the arduous journey from South Africa to see him, operating in shts to ensure someone is always close at hand.And he admitted he would have struggled to get through the early days in intensive care without the support of them, his friends and his team-mates.Now, despite having many months of treatment left, Solo insisted he has high hopes for the future.He said: “It’s been dficult going from being in top shape and at the top of my game to, the next day, collapsing and not being able to use my body at all and not knowing what’s wrong with me.“The first three months in ICU were tremendously dficult and I felt like a prisoner in my own body in that I was paralysed from the neck down, not being able to move any of my limbs, not being able to eat, drink or talk and with numbers and beeps going on all around.“It was quite depressing at times but having my family to support me through it all made it a lot better and more bearable.“As I recovered day by day we slowly got used to the fact my situation was what it was and we couldn’t do anything other than be positive and mentally strong about the outcome.“My attitude changed and I started focusing on what I could do to get better in the situation I am currently in.”He added: “Once I moved to the neuro ward I started making progress physically. I started being able to eat and drink normally again, and after the tracheotomy was taken out, I was able to talk normally again. These things made a huge dference to my mood and my optimism and I started to feel normal again in a way.“The last three months in neuro have been quite positive and I have been getting a lot of physio recovery working on my body and my strength and my movements, compared to the first three months in ICU where I was just sitting in pain and couldn’t breathe, eat or drink.“The journey itself is a dficult one and there is still a long way to go but I am optimistic for the future.”Solo recovered enough of his speech to send a message to his country’s rugby stars as they lted the World Cup and was also visited in hospital by England cricket star Ben Stokes.A fundraiser to send Solo home, set up by his agent Rob Humphries, has so far raised more than £, and Solo expressed his gratitude to those who have helped his cause so far.He said: “I am incredibly grateful. I could never have imagined receiving the amount of support I have throughout me being sick.“I am truly humbled and very grateful for all the support everyone has given me throughout this disease.”To donate to the fundraiser visit gf.me v c gfm oinhaelc"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.48811958-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.48811958-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.48811958-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.48811958-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"north east castle shuts as 60mph winds set to batter region","story":"A popular north-east estate has been forced to close due to strong winds.Crathes Castle will be closed today for safety reasons after the Met Office forecast winds of up to mph in the area.A statement on social media said: #This is to ensure safety of visitors from possible damage caused to trees and property.#Elsewhere in the region the Met Office has forecast winds of almost mph for some parts of the region.And in Moray, a yellow warning for wind is in place until pm tonight."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49432480-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49432480-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49432480-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49432480-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"sign up to join aberdeens race for life","story":"People across the north-east are urged to sing up for a charity race.Cancer Research UK has launched its Race for Le  and is calling on men, women and children to take part in the event on Sunday June  at the Beach Esplanade, Aberdeen.Every day,  people are diagnosed with cancer in Scotland and the number of people being diagnosed has now reached around , people every year.Lisa Adams, the charity’s spokeswoman in Scotland, said: “This January we’re urging mums, dads, nans, grandpas, brothers, sisters, friends and workmates to show their support by joining the Race for Le.“It’s a perfect example of everyday people doing an extraordinary thing –uniting in a common cause to beat cancer.”The K race starts at .am and the K at am.To enter, visit raceforle.org for more details."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/12/SNS-19749830-Hearts-v-Aberdeen.jpg ","title":"12 months on from new aberdeen deal its sam cosgrove who deserves all the credit for rise","story":"Exactly a year ago today Sam Cosgrove signed a contract extension tying him to Pittodrie until summer .Viewed  months on, tying up the striker’s long-term future was a masterstroke from the Aberdeen board.It would now take a multi-million-pound bid to force the Dons’ hand to sell a player who cost just £, in January .That could be tested this month as Middlesbrough, Derby County and Stoke are all tracking the -year-old.Prolic scoring does not go unnoticed and Aberdeen are braced for any approach or bid from England for Cosgrove this month.McInnes hailed the role head of recruitment Russ Richardson played in highlighting the then-unknown Carlisle United reserve player.He also acknowledged the Dons and the club’s coaching staff for giving Cosgrove the  to thrive.But ultimately it is the player, who netted  goals in , who is responsible for becoming one of the hottest strikers in Scotland.McInnes said: “Sam came to a club that could make him stronger, better and more confident.“All my staff have played a part in that.“My head of recruitment, Russ Richardson, also deserves so much praise for identying Sam.“When Russ watched Sam he liked how he received the ball and liked how he moved.“But ultimately Sam’s rise is not down to Russ, the staff or myself.“It is Sam who deserves the most for actually making the most of his opportunity. He relished the opportunity at Aberdeen and played the biggest part himself.”Officially Cosgrove netted  goals in  but the striker also netted a further two just days after penning his new deal.He scored both goals in Aberdeen’s - friendly win over United Arab Emirates’ side Dibba Al-Hisn in a friendly in Dubai last January.Cosgrove suffered a shaky start to his time at Aberdeen when sent off in his debut against Celtic on February  .He would have to wait  months since signing for his first goal when netting a double in a - defeat of St Mirren in October.That December he hit the goal trail, netting in five straight games to bag seven goals.McInnes insists they were looking for an alternative to prolic striker Adam Rooney. That December proved they had found one.Aberdeen then moved quickly to tie him up on a long-term deal beyond the contract that ran until summer .McInnes said: “We were looking for an alternative striker to Adam Rooney who we could work with and try to make better.“Jayden Stockley had obviously been with us but we knew we could maybe sell him back into England.“Jayden was maybe getting a bit frustrated that he wasn’t always playing ahead of Adam.“We wanted somebody a bit dferent with a bit of size.“When we first signed him that was something we spoke about but also to not be too dependent on his size in and around the box, to be a sharper striker and concentrate more on movement, positioning and anticipation rather than just letting the ball hit your head.“So thatteams sit in at home and want to defend their box, we have a striker there we can put in the box.“Sam has learned to use his size a lot better since being here.“He has relished the opportunity.”Cosgrove’s prolic scoring streak quickly caught the imagination of the Aberdeen supporters.They began chanting “Sam Cosgrove Ballon d’Or” at games in recognition of the successor to Rooney, who hit -plus goals for three successive season.Cosgrove has already smashed in  goals this season and became the first Aberdeen player to reach that milestone since Duncan Shearer in .He was denied the opportunity to add to that tally by a two-game ban for the final two games before the winter shutdown for a challenge on Celtic defender Kristoffer Ajer.Aberdeen appealed the straight red, arguing Cosgrove clearly won the ball, but the red and the ban were upheld.McInnes said: “There is no doubt that once Sam became really accepted by the supporters that meant so much to him.“For any young player,they know the supporters, the staff the players and the manager are behind him it means so much.“But particularly to know the supporters are right behind you because you can respond to that.“Sam has certainly responded.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49432480-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49432480-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49432480-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49432480-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"st johnstone boss tommy wright expects matty kennedy to join aberdeen","story":"St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright believes that Matty Kennedy will sign a pre-contract agreement with Aberdeen.The Perth boss hasn’t given up all hope that the former Kilmarnock winger can be persuaded the Pittodrie grass isn’t greener than McDiarmid Park’s but fears the worst.“Derekhas kept me informed about Matty and I think they have now made him an offer,” said Wright.“We are putting an offer to him as well because I don’t want to lose him.“But hand on heart, I don’t think we will be able to keep him.“I think he will go to Aberdeen.“I hope I am wrong and will keep encouraging him to stay and the club to keep him.“But with Aberdeen in for him, I think that’s what will happen.”Wright hopes that lessons will have been learned about the best time to try and secure star players on long-term deals.“I will be speaking to Kirstenabout it because we have to protect our assets better,” he said.“For a club of our size we have to move earlier because that’s when we have the advantage.“Matty had been in the wilderness.

Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in . At the time, the club#s office was aboard her.Closer to home, Ardrishaig man Billy Paterson called into the Advertiser offices to say his father, Ardrishaig Primary School headmaster Gilbert Paterson, had crewed the yacht Fulmar.Mr Paterson still has mementoes from his father#s trips in the form of gts from Commander Mowat, including a paperweight from , a copper and brass barrel ashtray dated  and a brass model yacht with #Fulmar # engraved on it.Thanks to everyone who contacted the Advertiser with their memories.We now know a little more about Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , owner of the Fulmar.Details about the crew of #Tanky#, #Bosun# and #Pilot# remain, however, sketchy, soanyone out there knows any more#"},{"url":null,"title":"my new year resolution is","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards"},{"url":null,"title":"plenty of christmas room at the inn","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens committee hosted its annual Christmas lunch in the Inveraray Inn.The event, on Sunday December  for senior citizens of Inveraray, was well attended with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and musical entertainment provided by Lochgilphead#s Easy Club.During the festivities, the committee presented flowers to Diane MacDonald, who is retiring from the committee after nine years."},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside.

The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"borderers-feature-queens-new-year-honours-list","story":"SEVERAL Borderers have been included in the Queens New Year Honours List.Steve Penny from the Tweed Valley Mountain Rescue Team has been awarded an MBE.The -year-old from Lindean has been a volunteer with the rescue team since moving to the area in .He also joined the Search  Rescue Dog Association Scotlandas a handler in the same year.Steve said: \"I was quite shocked when I got the letter, but also very proud.\"It means a lot as my grandfather got an MBE in , and at this time when my father has recently died it holds a very special meaning.\"As well as his local roles within mountain rescue, which have included Team Leader, Assistant Leader and Secretary, Steve is also the wellbeing officer for Scottish Mountain Rescue.In , his wellbeing framework for volunteer rescue responders was rolled out across Scotland and is now forming the backbone of a wider UK Wellbeing Initiative via UK Search and Rescue.And he is also a leading trainer across the country as part of the SMR Search Working Group.Steve has also taken on a series of Executive positions within Scottish Mountain Rescue over the years -

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

on bad parking at the free site near to Tesco in Haddington town centre.The move follows a controversial bid by the local authority to introduce a new alternative car park outside the town centre.A bid for a ldquotransportation hub to the east of the town was put forward last month and sparked an angry reaction from town centre traders, who fear it will put people off shopping in the centre.The council has launched a public consultation on Haddington town centre parking and transportation and this included an exhibition which showed images of people parking outwithallocated spaces in the current -space long-stay car park which is linked to Tescorsquos own short-stay customer car park.Under the heading ldquoindiscriminate parking, the images showed cars and vans parked on kerb corners and other unmarked areas of the car park which were not designated bays.It was, the council said, a way to illustrate the need for additional car parking in Haddington.Now the council has confirmed it is planning to introduce new traffic regulations which will stop people from parking outside spaces in the packed car park.A spokesperson said: ldquoA report will be presented to our cabinet meeting in January with proposals to introduce double yellow lines to the long-stay car park.This is to improve safety and reduce damage to the kerbs and road surfaces caused by indiscriminate parking.ldquoFollowing cabinet, the proposals will be subject to a statutory process before the necessary regulations could be introduced.Last October, the council introduced similar restrictions in its own staff car park at John Muir House, Haddington, which lies a short distance from the long-stay facility.That saw dozens of workers receive fines, from the team of private parking wardens employed by the council, for ignoring new yellow lines in their own car park.The long-stay car park in Haddington is on land owned by East Lothian Council and accessed through the adjoining short-stay car park attached to the neighbouring Tesco supermarket."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-electric-bridge-closure","story":"The Electric Bridge in Musselburgh was built to carry traffic involved in the construction of Cockenzie Power Station in the s and regularly opened on racedays in the town as traffic flooded in.However,ScottishPower announced last week that it would be closed from January , with no plans to re-open in the future.The company has been in discussions with East Lothian Council, which has already bought the majority of the former power station land, over the future ownership of the bridge.Those discussions seem to have hit the buffers after Musselburgh councillor Andrew Forrest told a meeting this week the future use of the bridge was ldquoout of

opened on race days at Musselburgh Racecourse to help with traffic through the busy town centre.When the power station closed in , the bridge, which spans the River Esk, was closed but an agreement was met with the racecourse, East Lothian Council and ScottishPower to open it for major events.At the MRAC meeting, racecourse general manager Bill Farnsworth said it was used until last year by the Musselburgh Riding of the Marches and was used by the Edinburgh Marathon as well as the racecourse.He described the decision by ScottishPower to close it as ldquodisappointing and said he had been told that ldquoScottishPower do not need it and East Lothian Council do not want it.Mr Farnsworth urged the local authority to try again to take ownership of the bridge, adding: ldquoWe are told the bridge is absolutely sound and in good order. It is a perfectlygood bridge that is being closed and we are urging councillors and the council to try and reach an agreement with ScottishPower.Howeve,r Mr Farnsworth was told that there was no reason why the racecourse itself could not approach ScottishPower to reach a separate agreement regarding opening the bridge in the future."},{"url":null,"title":"groundsman-almost-struck-replacing-divets-midway-race-musselburgh","story":"The lsquonear-missrsquo incident occurredduring the Edinburgh Cup in September when groundstaff had been warned to remember the main race of the day would see the runners go round the course twice over the two-mile event.However, it appeared one of the workers forgot and was still replacing ets on the ground when the horses came round the bend towards him.It was only when he heard jockeys shouting at him to get out of the way that he managed to duck under the barriers to safety.Bill Farnsworth, racecourse general manager, said a stewards inquiry was launched after the incident and the British Horseracing Authority investigated ruling that all protocolhad been followed by the racecourse itself.The incident came to light at a meeting of Musselburgh Racing Associated Committee this week.Mr Farnsworth said: ldquoThe Edinburgh Cup is a two-mile race and our head groundsman warned all the groundstaff to remember they go round twice.ldquoOne of the groundsmen went out and obviously forgot it was a two-mile race.ldquoHe was busy knocking in the ets as horses came around the bend and jockeys had to shout at him.ldquoHe ducked off the track, it was a lsquonear missrsquo.He added that a similar incident at Ascot in November had seen that course fined nearly pound, by the British Horseracing Authority for not following the proper protocol before the race.Mr Farnsworth said: ldquoThe sport needs to decideit is safe for people to get on track during racing, it is weighing up the benefit of repairing the track with the risk.

Having first taken hold in September, the fires have so far burnt through five million hectares of land, destroyed thousands of homes, claimed  human lives and killed an estimated  million animals. To say it has been devastating would be the understatement of the year.And while the consensus is that not every extreme weather event can be blamed on climate change, Dr Richard Thornton, chief executive of the Bushfires and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre, noted that with the average temperature in Australia now running around one degree higher than the long-term figure, fire seasons are starting earlier and ldquothe cumulative fire danger is growing. Or, as University of Sydney ecologist Professor Glenda Wardle put it, while not every weather event is the direct result of rising temperatures, ldquowhen you see trends it becomes undeniably linked to global climate change.So why the reticence from Australiarsquos leaders to name the issue, too  Back in November Mr McCormack caused outrage when he dismissed climate concerns as the obsession of ldquoraving inner-city lefties, while prime minister Scott Morrison continues to defend carbon-emissions policies that are widely held to be inadequate for a G member. The reason would seem plain for all to see, with the opportunity for Australia to expand its lucrative role as a leading exporter of fossil fuels apparently making the science just too easy to ignore.It is an unforgivable stance to take, and one that is entirely out of step with the general direction of travel. Indeed, at a time when local and national governments around the world have declared a climate emergency, the onus is on all of us to do our bit to avert the crisis. The younger generation has risen to the challenge, taking to the streets to shame policymakers into taking action. Older generations are making changes too, dumping fossil-fuel companies from their investment portfolios and putting pressure on employers to eliminate them from their pensions.It is not just small investors who are taking more of an interest in what their money is funding, with more and more institutional investors starting to question the moral legitimacy of channelling funds into companies whose activities are contributing to the destruction of the planet. Environmental organisation , which aims to ldquoend the age of fossil fuels, says more than , asset managers, pension funds and insurers have pledged to take such action, the aim being to ldquoremove [companiesrsquo] social licence to operate.The Church of England, which has an pound. billion investment pot at its disposal, is one such investor. In  the churchrsquos General Synod voted by  to four to est its holdings in fossil-fuel companies, with a spokesperson saying at the time that the vote made clear that the church ldquomust play a leading role and exercise its moral leadership on the urgent issue of climate change. Attempts are being made to see the Church of Scotland follow suit. Although last May its General Assembly narrowly rejected a motion that would have seen it disinvest from oil and gas companies, Rev Dr Richard Frazer, convener of the Church and Society Council, has said it must now take action ldquoas a matter of urgency.Writing in The Herald last month, he said the council believes that ldquofor reasons of conscience and out of an urgent necessity to respond to what is happening to our planet, we must accelerate the process of weaning ourselves off our dependence on fossil fuels. ldquoIn taking this decision we have approved a report which we will be commending to next yearrsquos General Assembly, recommending that the Church sells its shares in oil and gas companies as a matter of urgency, he wrote.Yet while Dr Frazer stressed that the council had made its decision based on its deeply held belief that Christians have ldquoa duty to care for Godrsquos earth, will the Kirk actually be able to fulfil that dutyit washes its hands of those companies completely  Surely it would do more good by retaining its investments and using its position as a high-profile investor to drive positive change from within It is certainly the opinion of mega-investor Bill Gates that estment programmes are all but pointless, with the removal of even large sums of money unlikely to have enough of an impact to make oil or gas giants change course. Others, such as Japanrsquos . trillion national pension fund, prefer to engage with the companies they invest in, using their clout as major shareholders to hold management teams to account. It is the right approach: while no amount of engagement will stop a fossil-fuel company being a fossil-fuel company, these businesses like any other can and should be forced to set and achieve emissions-reduction targets.It is worth noting that while the Church of England has sold out of positions in tar sands and thermal coal businesses, it retains large investments in oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell. Crucially, it has started voting against the re-election of chairmen of companies such as EOG Resources for doing too little to combat climate change. It is exactly the kind of activism that is needed.Ultimately, while it is clear that carbon emissions from fossil fuels are causing the planet to warm, the only way for fossil-fuel companies to be driven out of existence is for everyone to stop using fossil fuels. As that is not likely to fully happen for many years ndashever ndash it is better that investors like the Church of Scotland use their boardroom influence to ensure those businesses are contributing to the solution rather than just blaming them for creating the problem.It may seem counterintuitive, but the climate crisis will never be solvedeveryone simply stands shouting from the sidelines."},{"url":null,"title":"one-day-little-womens-jo-might-real-equality","story":"Throughout Greta Gerwigs radical new adaptation of Little Women, female economic and social power are questioned and explored, as are the ious effects of marriage on a womans le.What has changed, from then until now Here is Marmee, taking on the unpaid caring role for the entire town.Here is Meg, her domestic labours undermined and undervalued by her husband.Here is Jo, determined to be an independent, single woman, to \"paddle my own canoe\" but being pressured into marriage, questioned relentlessly about why she doesnt want to have a relationship.\"You remind me of myself,\" Marmee tells Jo, following Jos failure to keep a grip on her explosive temper.\"But youre never angry,\" Jo replies.\"Im angry nearly every day of my le,\" Marmee says. And such a lot she had to be angry about, and such a lot we still have to be angry about, particularly when it comes to men and womens equality in relationships.In one furious scene, Laurie, the March sisters neighbour and close friend, has had his marriage proposal rejected by Jo and is now moping around Paris, drinking his grandfathers money and behaving like a spoiled child.He attempts to give Amy a dressing down for her desire to marry into money she is, at that point in the film, awaiting a proposal. Amy will have none of it. There is no way, she tells Laurie, for a woman to earn her own keep. When she marries she will be the property of her husband any property she owns or money she might earn, will be the property of her husband any children she might have will be the property of her husband. Marriage removes a womans legal right to herself.\"Donrsquot sit there,\" she flares at Laurie, \"And tell me that marriage isnrsquot an economic proposition.\"There is the most obvious change between then and now. Women now earn their own keep. Their children belong to them, their property belongs to them. These are changes made more recently than its comfortable to think about, but they are changes the March girls would be astounded by.Marriage was a system designed to control and subdue women, and to limit their economic power.But marriage is still an economic proposition. Marriage comes with great financial risk for women. They are more likely, when children enter the equation, to give up full time work and so limit their earning potential and their pension contributions.According to the Chartered Insurance Institute, the average orced woman has less than a third of the pension wealth of the average orced man.Repeated studies have shown that the benefits of marriage for men far outweigh the benefits for women. Married men are likely to be in better physical and mental health than their single counterparts, have more money and have greater social support networks.For women, there is very little dference in these measures between single and married women, apart from money, where non-married women are better off. Other studies have shown that married women report lower satisfaction levels than co-habiting or single women and are more likely to initiate orce than men.In Louisa May Alcotts Little Women, Jo quits her writing and is married off, a decision Alcott, who never married, said she regretted. Jo should have remained a \"literary spinster\". In Gerwigs film, Jo is given a book.\"What I was trying to reverse-engineer,\" she said. \"Was this moment that Jo getting her book would make the audience feel like you usually feel when the heroine is chosen by the hero. I wanted to seeI could create that feeling, but with a girl and her book.\"It is a perfect ending to a feminist, questioning film. But, in real le, imagine we could move beyond an either or choice for women where a relationship is not a stymie to her creative output or stem from an oppressive institution.Couples are increasingly turning their backs on marriage. Co-habitation is the fastest growing type of relationship in the UK where the number of co-habiting couples has doubled to . million in  years.The risks for women, though, are even greater in an unmarried partnership. There is a general misconception that co-habiting couples have legal rights similar to those of married couples, leaving women and their children vulnerable.In England last week the first mixed-sex civil partnerships took place after a law change brought about following a y campaign by a couple, Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, who wanted a system that gives them legal protections without the patriarchal baggage of marriage.This is common in other parts of the world - from de-facto rights in Australia to Frances civil solidarity pact and mixed-sex civil partnerships in Netherlands, South Africa, New Zealand and the Isle of Man.Here, the Civil PartnershipBill is making its way through parliament to make mixed-sex partnerships legal in Scotland. Around , mixed-sex couples are expected to form civil partnerships next year.For feminists, for the non-religious, for those who want a new structure within which to define their relationships, this is an exciting development and it will be interesting to see how a civil pact, rather than a marriage, changes the way women feel and thrive in their relationships.The ambition of civil partnerships is to create true equality. If the much-adapted Little Women reflects how society feels about women at any given time, perhaps the next iteration will see Jo end up with both her novel and an equal match."},{"url":null,"title":"bafta-nominations-full-joker-leads-11-nods","story":"Scorsese.

No big deal, you might think, but in these parts the red squirrel is better protected than the royals at Balmoral. A hit squad was despatched to find and eliminate the intruder, which they did within  hours.The grey squirrel, a th-century import from America, has a terrible reputation, thanks to its impact on its native red cousin. Culling is usually considered the best solution and, for the sake of the red, which is particularly susceptible to disease carried by its relative, I wouldnrsquot argue with that. Less grisly but more final are attempts at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh to alter the DNA of female greys to render them infertile. If that works then theyrsquoll soon disappear forever, hopefully leaving To Let signs encouraging reds to .No such fancul nonsense in the scientic world, of course. An ecologist at Edinburgh Napier University has pointed out the double standards involved in public attitudes. Whereas the grey squirrel has conservationists reaching for guns and traps, another ldquoinvasive alien species ndash the domestic cat ndash is so beloved, there are an estimated  million in the UK.Ecologist Dr Jason Gilchrist, writing on the academic website The Conversation, says: ldquoIt is often argued that killing grey squirrels is justied as they predate bird nests. They do, and so do red squirrels, but there is scant evidence that squirrels have a signicant impact on songbirds. While domestic and feral cats decimate songbird populations, they are unlikely to be targeted for culls any time soon... In terms of the ecological damage they do, the impact of both species is similar: they donrsquot belong here and are having negative effects on wildle.While this doesnrsquot emphasise the potentially irreversible effect of greys on red squirrels, he has a point about predatory cats. They kill about  million wild birds every year. It would be a horrying tallythese were all healthy young things but the RSPB says the majority are either sickly or weak and would soon have expired anyway. Cold comfort for those of us clearing the crime scene where a fat wood pigeon has gasped its last. Nor do I entirely believe it. Watching a black tom motionless as a gatepost beside our chirruping beech hedge, itrsquos easy to see how a healthy robin, fooled into thinking it was a shadow, could be caught unawares.Even the most besotted owners squirm at the trophies dropped at their feet ndash often not entirely dead ndash and while itrsquos good to keep down rodents, disposing of feathered carcasses tucked in your slippers is no fun. I say this as a cat person. So far as Irsquom aware, the only thing my city cat ever caught was a mouse, which I managed to rescue and put back on the street. My cat used to sleep like a Russian fur hat on my pillow, and when she died it was little short of heartbreaking. But now I have a garden, with a hedge that quivers with sparrows and finches, I couldnrsquot possibly replace her. It would be like tossing a live grenade onto the lawn. Itrsquos in catsrsquo nature to kill, and other than keeping them confined indoors, or hanging a bell as loud as Big Ben around their neck, they will inevitably go on carnivorous sprees.Dr Gilchrist is well aware that his comments might outrage the feline-owning community. His aim, he says, is simply ldquoto bring some logic and consistency to the way we treat animals. The problem is, therersquos nothing logical about the love cats inspire.Pointing out the savage heart that beats within every sweetly purring tabby, for instance, makes absolutely no dference to the cooing and clucking around their every move. Ian Fleming knew what he was doing when he placed a cold-eyed white Persian in his villain Blofeldrsquos arms. It was hard to tell which was the more sinister, each, as he implied, being utterly deadly. More recently, the costume designers and make-up artists for the film version of Cats were way off the mark. Turning one of the most alluring and lithe species into a creepy hybrid with long legs, flapping arms and a human body completely misses the essence of the feline kingdom. Whether itrsquos a Siamese or a tortoiseshell, a Bengal or a Manx, elegance is key. Much of the allure lies in their aesthetic appeal and the dignity and hauteur with which they behave. Itrsquos no wonder the Egyptians treated them as Gods. Nor that they were considered an essential accessory for a witchrsquos diabolical work.Whereas squirrels might be impressively athletic and undeniably cute, they cannot compete with the fascination cats hold. This arises in part from their disturbingly dual personality. Unlike dogs ndash what you see is what you get ndash they are mysterious and ungovernable.

No big deal, you might think, but in these parts the red squirrel is better protected than the royals at Balmoral. A hit squad was despatched to find and eliminate the intruder, which they did within  hours.The grey squirrel, a th-century import from America, has a terrible reputation, thanks to its impact on its native red cousin. Culling is usually considered the best solution and, for the sake of the red, which is particularly susceptible to disease carried by its relative, I wouldnrsquot argue with that. Less grisly but more final are attempts at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh to alter the DNA of female greys to render them infertile. If that works then theyrsquoll soon disappear forever, hopefully leaving To Let signs encouraging reds to .No such fancul nonsense in the scientic world, of course. An ecologist at Edinburgh Napier University has pointed out the double standards involved in public attitudes. Whereas the grey squirrel has conservationists reaching for guns and traps, another ldquoinvasive alien species ndash the domestic cat ndash is so beloved, there are an estimated  million in the UK.Ecologist Dr Jason Gilchrist, writing on the academic website The Conversation, says: ldquoIt is often argued that killing grey squirrels is justied as they predate bird nests. They do, and so do red squirrels, but there is scant evidence that squirrels have a signicant impact on songbirds. While domestic and feral cats decimate songbird populations, they are unlikely to be targeted for culls any time soon... In terms of the ecological damage they do, the impact of both species is similar: they donrsquot belong here and are having negative effects on wildle.While this doesnrsquot emphasise the potentially irreversible effect of greys on red squirrels, he has a point about predatory cats. They kill about  million wild birds every year. It would be a horrying tallythese were all healthy young things but the RSPB says the majority are either sickly or weak and would soon have expired anyway. Cold comfort for those of us clearing the crime scene where a fat wood pigeon has gasped its last. Nor do I entirely believe it. Watching a black tom motionless as a gatepost beside our chirruping beech hedge, itrsquos easy to see how a healthy robin, fooled into thinking it was a shadow, could be caught unawares.Even the most besotted owners squirm at the trophies dropped at their feet ndash often not entirely dead ndash and while itrsquos good to keep down rodents, disposing of feathered carcasses tucked in your slippers is no fun. I say this as a cat person. So far as Irsquom aware, the only thing my city cat ever caught was a mouse, which I managed to rescue and put back on the street. My cat used to sleep like a Russian fur hat on my pillow, and when she died it was little short of heartbreaking. But now I have a garden, with a hedge that quivers with sparrows and finches, I couldnrsquot possibly replace her. It would be like tossing a live grenade onto the lawn. Itrsquos in catsrsquo nature to kill, and other than keeping them confined indoors, or hanging a bell as loud as Big Ben around their neck, they will inevitably go on carnivorous sprees.Dr Gilchrist is well aware that his comments might outrage the feline-owning community. His aim, he says, is simply ldquoto bring some logic and consistency to the way we treat animals. The problem is, therersquos nothing logical about the love cats inspire.Pointing out the savage heart that beats within every sweetly purring tabby, for instance, makes absolutely no dference to the cooing and clucking around their every move. Ian Fleming knew what he was doing when he placed a cold-eyed white Persian in his villain Blofeldrsquos arms. It was hard to tell which was the more sinister, each, as he implied, being utterly deadly. More recently, the costume designers and make-up artists for the film version of Cats were way off the mark. Turning one of the most alluring and lithe species into a creepy hybrid with long legs, flapping arms and a human body completely misses the essence of the feline kingdom. Whether itrsquos a Siamese or a tortoiseshell, a Bengal or a Manx, elegance is key. Much of the allure lies in their aesthetic appeal and the dignity and hauteur with which they behave. Itrsquos no wonder the Egyptians treated them as Gods. Nor that they were considered an essential accessory for a witchrsquos diabolical work.Whereas squirrels might be impressively athletic and undeniably cute, they cannot compete with the fascination cats hold. This arises in part from their disturbingly dual personality. Unlike dogs ndash what you see is what you get ndash they are mysterious and ungovernable. As they lie on your lap, exquisitely lovely and touchingly affectionate, they make people feel special.

People in Orkney will be shocked to hear how often those making emergency calls are being forced to wait due to a lack of land ambulance cover. In many instances, these will be cases where the response time can be critical.“This is absolutely no criticism of Orkney’s ambulance crews, who do outstanding work in operating a service that is clearly over-stretched. Indeed, the admission from the Minister about the scale of the problem shows that local crews are being let down by a lack of resources and support. This can only be making an already dficult job even more challenging.“I am due to meet senior representatives of the Scottish Ambulance Service early next month. I will make clear the need for an urgent review into the resources available locally and calling for additional capacity to meet the needs of the Orkney community.

He met two men at a hotel and then took a bullet train to Osaka before boarding a private jet hidden inside a case for musical equipment. He flew to Istanbul and was then transferred on to another plane bound for Beirut, where he arrived on December .Ghosn portrayed his arrest as a plot linked to a decline in the financial performance of Nissan. He had been in favour of merging Nissan with industry ally Renault, of which he was also chairman. --Grab of a photo made available by IHA of packing crates, one of which IHA claims Carlos Ghosn used to hide to escape from Japan--ldquoUnfortunately there was no trust. And some of our Japanese friends thought that the only way to get rid of Renault in Nissan is to get rid of me, he said.ldquoI should never have been arrested in the first place, he said.ldquoIrsquom not above the law and I welcome the opportunity for the truth to come out and have my name cleared, he told a packed room of journalists.Ghosn said he would be ready to stand trial ldquoanywhere where I think I can have a fair trial. He declined to say what country that might be.Lebanon last week received an Interpol-issued wanted notice ndash a non-binding request to law enforcement agencies worldwide that they locate and provisionally arrest a fugitive.Lebanon and Japan do not have an extradition treaty, and the Interpol notice does not require Lebanon to arrest him. Lebanese authorities have said Ghosn entered the country on a legal passport, casting doubt on the possibility they would hand him over to Japan. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Carlos Ghosn faces the media--At the request of the Japanese government, Interpol published the notice on its website on Wednesday as Ghosn was giving his news conference. The notice was previously only sent to Interpolrsquos member governments but not shared with the public.Ghosn, who is Lebanese and also holds French and Brazilian passports, was expected to go on trial in Tokyo in April. In earlier statements, he has said he fled to avoid ldquopolitical persecution by a ldquorigged Japanese justice system. He also said that he alone organised his departure from Japan and that his we Carole played no role.On Tuesday, Tokyo prosecutors obtained an arrest warrant for Mrs Ghosn on suspicion of perjury. That charge is not related to his escape. Lebanonrsquos justice minister said Lebanon has not received any request related to that warrant. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Journalists outside the house of Carlos Ghosn in Beirut--Japanese justice officials acknowledge that it is unclear whether the Ghosns can be brought back to Japan to face charges.Ghosnrsquos former employer, Nissan Motor Co, said it was still pursuing legal action against him despite his escape, adding that Ghosn engaged in serious misconduct while leading the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance. Ghosn denies all the charges.In France, meanwhile, prosecutors are investigating a ,-eurogt from the chateau of Versailles to Ghosn, linked to a lavish party there. Renault alerted French authorities after a company investigation found that Ghosn personally benefited from ldquoan exchange worth , euros in the framework of a philanthropic accord signed with the Chateau of Versailles.Renault said in June that an internal audit with partner Nissan found  million eurosin questionable expenses at their Dutch-based holding linked to Ghosn. The two carmakers recommended legal action in the Netherlands, where the alliance is based, and ordering Ghosn himself to reimburse the company for some of the expenses.Earlier in the day, Tokyo prosecutors raided a Japanese lawyerrsquos office where Ghosn had visited regularly before he fled.-- vw,vw,px, px\"Carlos Ghosn and his we Carole--Japanese media reports said prosecutors were likely to have seized a computer to track down how Ghosn escaped and who might have helped him.An hour before the scheduled press conference, a Lebanese prosecutor said Ghosn will be summoned ldquoin the coming hours over a visit to Israel more than  years ago, according to the state-run National News Agency.Two Lebanese lawyers had submitted a report to the Public Prosecutorrsquos Office against Ghosn last week, saying he violated Lebanese law by visiting Israel. The two neighbouring countries are technically in a state of war. Prosecutor Ghassan Khoury met with the two lawyers who filed the case on Wednesday and asked them to bring additional evidence, adding he would summon Ghosn in the coming hours.Ghosn visited Israel in  and met officials including the prime minister and the president. At the time, he announced the launch of electric cars in Israel.copy -. This site is part of Newsquests audited local newspaper network. A Gannett Company.

The study also notes that the UKrsquos young people are ldquomiles behind their European peers in foreign languages, with just a third able to speak more than just their mother tongue.And it warns that post-Brexit, language skills cannot be ignored, and the UK cannot rely on the assumption that the rest of the world speaks English.The study says there has been a huge drop in demand for language learning in recent years.ldquoIn England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the scrapping of the compulsory foreign language GCSE in  has had a detrimental effect on national uptake levels, the paper says.ldquoThis measure failed to anticipate the vast drop in uptake. ldquoGiven fewer than half of pupils now take a GCSE foreign language, compared to % in , we are far behind the rest of Europe, and changes in governmental attitudes and policy are pressing. The author calculates that at GCSE, entries for French have dropped by % since , while German entries have fallen %.There has been a rise in the numbers taking Spanish over this period, overtaking German in , and last year there was an overall rise in the numbers taking modern foreign languages.The report also says that entries for French and German A-level have been falling since the mid-s, and there has been a fall in recent years in the numbers applying to study certain languages at university.The falls are having an impact on the languages ldquopipeline, the report suggests, affecting the numbers of language graduates and trained teachers. This, along with reductions in EU school staff, will threaten languages in schools, it says.The study concludes: ldquoThe assumption that lsquothe rest of the world speaks Englishrsquo hinders new international collaborations and overlooks cultural and cognitive enhancement developed by learning.ldquoPolitical developments mean change is more pressing. If the UK is to thrive outside the EU, language skills cannot be ignored ndash the UK must address educational declines and capitalise on lsquountapped reservoirs of linguistic capacityrsquo.ldquoIt is crucial that ancient and modern languages receive support in schools and higher education. The report puts forward a series of recommendations, including calling for foreign language study to be compulsory at GCSE level, with youngsters encouraged, but not obliged to take an accredited GCSE or alternative qualication.Report author Megan Bowler, a third-year Classics undergraduate at the University of Oxford, said: ldquoIt was a big mistake to scrap compulsory foreign languages at GCSE.ldquoRather than continuing to present languages as not suitable for everyone, we need to include a broader range of pupils learning through a iety of qualications geared to dferent needs.Nick Hillman, HEPI director said: ldquoThe decision to limit language learning in schools by making GCSE languages voluntary is probably the single most damaging education policy implemented in England so far this century.ldquoThe UK is bottom of the pile for the number of young people familiar with another language, and miles behind every EU country.A Department for Education spokesman said: ldquoWe are committed to ensuring more pupils are studying languages, which is why it is compulsory for all children between years three and nine.ldquoThe introduction of the EBacc halted the decline in languages and since  the proportion of pupils studying a language at GCSE has risen from % to % in . ldquoWe are also taking a range of steps to make sure that the uptake of languages continues to increase, such as creating a new network of schools and funding programmes like our Mandarin Excellence Programme.copy -.

A substantial part of the growth is in whole-property rentals and this has caused concern in some areas of Scotland about the impact on local communities and the availability of housing for permanent residents.But he said short-term lets were an important source of flexible accommodation for tourists and workers and helped support the growth of Scotlandrsquos tourism industry.Mr Stewart said the government had received over , responses to its consultation on the issue and consultation events had been held with residents, businesses, guests, hosts, s and local authorities.He said the licensing scheme for short-term lets would help councils to know what was happening in their area, improve safety and handle complaints effectively.Safety requirements would be a mandatory condition on licences, but councils would have discretion to impose additional conditions, for example on littering or overcrowding of properties.And councils would also be able to charge a fee for administering the scheme and enforcing it.He said the government would give local authorities the power to introduce short-term let control areas, covering the whole or part of their area, where change of use to whole-property lets would require planning permission.ldquoRenting a room in your own home or allowing others to stay in your own home while yoursquore on holiday does not take homes away from residents or cause the same issues as whole-property short-term lets and they will not be affected by the control areas.Robust but proportionate and fairMr Stewart said the tax review was to ensure short-term lets made an appropriate contribution to the communities they operated in and support local services.He described the proposals as ldquorobust but proportionate and fair. ldquoThese measures allow us to make progress to address a pressing issue for some of our communities but they will not unduly curtail the benefits of short term lets to hosts, visitors and the Scottish economy.And he said the government would monitor the measures at every stage to make sure they were effective and avoided unintended consequences.Lothian Green MSP Andy Wightman, who has spoken out forcefully on the issue of short-term lets in the Capital, said: ldquoI am pleased that the Minister has finally acted on my long term campaign.ldquoThose communities who have been adversely impacted by short term lets will be pleased the government has now committed to introducing a much-needed, long overdue licensing scheme by .Edinburgh council leader Adam McVey said he was pleased the authorityrsquos call for new legislation had been successful.He said: ldquoThis is extremely welcome news and will give us the controls that we need over short term lets for our residents and communities across Edinburgh.ldquoThe announcement by the Minister meets our request for mandatory licenses and we will now be in a position to more effectively implement planning controls to stop the increase of short term lets.ldquoA review of taxation of short term lets will also make sure that businesses are paying properly for income theyrsquore receiving and local services theyrsquore using.Scottish Conservative housing spokesman Graham Simpson said regulation was needed but there were too few details on how it would work.ldquoWe donrsquot even knowcouncils will be able to refuse licences or on what grounds.And he claimed: ldquoThere is a danger that we could have a triple tax whammy on tourismthe SNP introduces an Airbnb tax on top of a tourist tax and a fee for licences.Lothian Labour MSP Sarah Boyack said s like Airbnb allowed people to make use of their properties and gave visitors additional options, but the lack of regulation had led to anti-social behaviour and the loss of much-needed homes.ldquoThere is a big issue in Edinburgh which has spiralled out of control, so we urgently need local councils to have the power to regulate locally.She welcomed the licensing powers but raised concerns about the control areas. ldquoIt sounds very much like Rent Pressure Zones, which have failed.She said councils needed the power to control the scale and density of short-term lets and to cap the number in their area.Housing charity Shelter said Airbnb-style short-term lets helped make Scotland an attractive place to visit, but their unregulated growth meant people being locked out of homes that could be let privately to help tackle Scotlandrsquos housing emergency.Welcome first stepShelter Scotland director Graeme Brown said the measures were a welcome first step. ldquoThe test will becommunities in places like Edinburgh see real change and real opportunities to find the homes they need.Airbnb said it wanted to clary how the cost of licensing would impact on families who let out spare bedrooms or their main property and are less able to absorb additional costs.But an Airbnb spokesman said:ldquoWe have long supported calls for fair regulations.

But away from Stormont it’s clear that the PSNI and its still relatively new Chief Constable have a lot of work to do in order to undo the damage done in what’s been a year of reversals and missteps for an organisation that appears to have lost its direction and purpose. Not to put too fine a point on it, it’s been a disaster for the PSNI vis a vis its relationship with the nationalist community. The support the new policing arrangements were given to allow devolution to forge ahead was contingent on a number of factors, most of which have either fallen by the wayside or are being flagrantly disregarded. At the most basic level, the urgent requirement for the policing service to reflect the community it serves has never been met –on the contrary, it now appears to be in reverse with calls growing for ato - recruitment. Coming two decades after the formation of the PSNI, this is desperately disappointing and places a question mark over the very concept of fair and balanced policing. But to make things immeasurably worse, the performance of Simon Byrne in the top job has led many to question the wisdom of his appointment. Any casual observation of recent history will reveal that there is no appetite within the nationalist political family for knee-jerk targeting of new PSNI Chief Constables. But when the PSNI needs to be held to account it is held to account in a robust and positive manner – the legacy issue being a recurring source of contention. But in the seven months since Mr Byrne took on the role, we’ve seen an extraordinary series of what we might charitably call unfortunate events – some cynical and deliberate acts, some common or garden incompetence – which have been incredibly debilitating to law and order in the north and which mean that the coming year is one in which his ability to see out his contract is going to be put under very serious scrutiny. First and most worrying is Mr Byrne’s increasing determination to use the PSNI as a bulwark against progress on the aforementioned legacy issue. His decision to go the Supreme Court to appeal adverse rulings on legacy investigations has seen him park the PSNI tank on the lawn of victims and survivors. His extraordinarily brutish threat to take children away from their parents quite frankly left some experienced observers here open-mouthed in astonishment. And his handling of summer bonfire issues – in particular the Avoniel and New Lodge stand-offs – underlined concerns around whether he’s possessed of the necessary insight and tactical nous to lead the PSNI forward. And to put the tin hat on an annus horribilis for policing here, Mr Byrne decided to pose for a Christmas pic with heavily armed officers at Crossmaglen barracks, to the consternation of nationalist politicians.

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can.

No worries. I can’t even think of how I’ll start pronouncing your very dficult Irish first name. Foreigners will take time to digest the following Gaelic names: Caoimhe, Oisín, Siobhán, Niamh and a host of others. There is a historical context to this and this could just be the colonial remnants that were left in Africa as official languages! But that’s not an excuse, we must spell your names correctly and we hope you compliment migrants likewise. Udhi nade jo Belfast  . Its dholuo language spoken by people of the Luo community. The Luos were split around the East African borders of Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda South Sudan by migration southwards and during the remapping of Africa in . That’s a story for another day. Luo is among hundreds of dferent African languages and dialects spoken in Belfast. Most Africans are in many cases authoritatively bilingual, spoken and written, no supernatural powers there, just a fact of le and that’s before you include the colonial language English, French etc, so effectively trilingual. In many encounters Africans residing in Ireland are often politely teased with the query, can you speak African please  Honestly, we don’t get offended by that question, generally the interlocutor would probably have assumed that “Africa” is a Pan-African language. I wish! The continent has over , languages, dialects and subcultures. Notwithstanding, the four countries listed above are just a small fraction of African nationalities in Belfast. There are many. The population of perhaps the total sum of  African countries as represented in Belfast could be in the thousands – although being hypothetical is not my cup of tea. West and North Belfast are probably the more African by headcount, followed by South and then East of the city. Some African countries are more visible than others here and we shall come to that in one of my future writings here at Andersonstown News. I just can’t wait. There is so much to explore in the lives of Africans in West and the rest of Belfast when you are inside the broth, it is the freshness you will get in this column moving forward, the smell, beauty and finesse of Africa. Having authored articles on migration in this past decade, it will certainly be a new environment to revisit, new faces, adults and also growing youthful population of first, second and third generation people who were either born in Africa or strongly identy with the continent because of family ties, social or legal reasons. n Elly Omondi Odhiambo is a freelance writer based in Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the ghost of policing past visits","story":"I WRITE this column on the th anniversary of the murder of Fearghal Caraher from Cullyhanna. Mr Caraher had been the victim of systemic harassment by the RUC in the lead-in to the Royal Marines shooting him dead. The harassing RUC were based at Crossmaglen Barracks. Sited beside Crossmaglen Rangers GAA club, RUC officers and British army soldiers had to be flown in via helicopter in military operations. All while the people who actually lived in the place trained, played and socialised in the GAA grounds on its doorstep. It was a physical epitome of occupation. Social media at Christmas is usually the pretty standard fare of hope and goodwill to all. Sadly, the PSNI’s Chief Constable social media was a wholly dferent offering, echoing Christmases Past in South Armagh. His pictures came from Crossmaglen , a strange choice of venue given the PSNI barracks in Crossmaglen has transformed from the days of conflict and is only open a few hours a week. Tuesday and Thursday from am-pm and on a Saturday from pm-pm. Not Wednesdays, not Christmas Day . But it was not the out-of-hours visit that caused people to stop in their tracks. It was the picture of Mr Byrne with four of his colleagues, two of them posing with heavy-duty rles. It was reminiscent of the heavy, dark days of conflict when the RUC would stand posing in their militarised version of disgraced policing. And all of the resulting echoes of the RUC, militarisation, shoot-to-kill and disgrace evoked by those photographs were heard loud and clear on Christmas Day as we read the tweet in disbelief. The response was unanimous from the population of Crossmaglen and the politicians that represent it: that it was ill-judged at best, and in no way reflected the contextual reality for modern policing. The wider response from commentators, journalists and others on social media was equally swt. This was an unwarranted, unhelpful and bizarre tweet and another misstep from a tone-deaf Chief Constable. This was in further evidence on St Stephen’s Day when he refused to withdraw the tweet and issued a statement justying the display of heavy weaponry as reflecting the terrorist threat his officers operate with. Presumably on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and Saturday evenings. It insulted the intelligence of anyone with half a genuine concern. His response displays the signs of a a weak man trying to act hard and when called out refuses to accept responsibility and blames the “bad boys”. The six counties have never had acceptable policing. Policing has always operated at dferent stages of history to reinforce British occupation: the Protestant State for a Protestant People since partition British military policy during the conflict and extremely sinister policies of shoot to kill and collusion. The PSNI is meant to be the new beginning we deserve and need. Human rights-compliant, accountable, community-based, responsive and supported policing that meets our needs as a community in its entirety. Many of us have tried to make that potential a reality. This Chief Constable doesn’t get it and, most worryingly of all, he appears to be too arrogant in his approach to learn. If policing was in crisis under George Hamilton for its defence of the RUC, which it was, then things have worsened under the clueless Mr Byrne."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland parties brexit amendment defeated in commons","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There are powers in the protocol for the Government to do that.\"Last month, MPs voted overwhelming in favour of Boris Johnsons Brexit deal, however it has been strongly opposed by the DUP, who feel it will result in Northern Ireland being treated dferently than the rest of the UK.The DUPs Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson called for the Government to maintain unfettered access after Brexit for Northern Ireland to the British market by putting it on the face of the Bill. Reading a section of the Conservative Partys manesto relating to the partys commitment to Northern Ireland, Mr Wilson told MPs: \"The amendments which we have put forward are designed to be positive, theyre designed to ensure that promises which the Government has made are honoured and also the manesto commitment which the Government has made in relation to Northern Ireland, in which it states it will guarantee the full economic benefits of Brexit. DUP MP Sammy Wilson\"All of the amendments that we intend to move forward intend to ensure that that promise is delivered on.\" Mr Wilson added that his amendments will ensure the \"minister must bring forward regulations\", that these regulations \"ensure that there is unfettered access to the GB market\" and \"that unfettered access is defined in the Bill\". Criticising the fact that Mr Wilson is the only member of Northern Ireland allowed to speak in this section of the debate, new SDLP MP Claire Hanna said: \"This will contribute to the very real feeling that this Brexit, and this form of Brexit, is being enforced on Northern Ireland, who have never given their consent.\" She added: \"If the Government mean anything they say about protecting Northern Ireland and about unfettered access and about non-tarf barriers, then at a minimum they should accept new clause .\""},{"url":null,"title":"forget bridge tunnel best way to link northern ireland and great britain say experts","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Instead, they favour the construction of a tunnel under the Irish Sea. In fact, the plan is for two tunnels - one from England to the Isle of Man, and a second from the Isle of Man to Co Down.They say their proposal would be better than a bridge, as a rail tunnel would not be at the mercy of bad weather, and would avoid the problems in spanning Beaufort Dyke, a deep sea trench in the North Channel containing a million tonnes of dumped wartime munitions.The plan is part of a broader list of tunnel projects put forward by the society. They include a tunnel from Hampshire to the Isle of Wight, another under the Bristol Channel between the West Country and Wales, and a new tunnel under the Thames.Bill Grose, lead author of the ICE report, told the Sunday Times: \"A tunnel starting north of Liverpool that surfaced in the Isle of Man and then went back under to reach Belfast would solve all the problems\" he said.\"Tunnels are less prone to bad weather, and construction is getting faster and cheaper every year.\"The distance from England to the Isle of Man is around  miles, and from the Isle of Man to Northern Ireland is just over  miles.Mr Grose, a former chairman of the British Tunnelling Society, added: \"As prices continue to fall, tunnels will become increasingly attractive as a way of connecting the United Kingdom.\"It cost about £m per kilometre for a twin rail tunnel, but costs are falling. When we reduce them by another %, tunnelling will become popular and very long tunnels become feasible.\"Tunnels and bridges cost much the same - but tunnels are not prone to bad weather.\"The ambitious proposals are surfacing as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is known to be interested in major construction projects to unite the UK in the post-Brexit era.In September last year it was learned that Mr Johnson had asked Government officials for advice on the costs and risks of building a bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland.Initial estimates put the cost at around £bn.

institutions.It is understood the DUP and Sinn Fein were orally briefed on the text of the document late on Wednesday afternoon, with the three smaller parties – the SDLP, Ulster Unionists and Alliance – then invited in for their own inidual briefings.Read MoreHealth boss calls for resurrection of Stormont to solve impasseThe developments took place amid a strike by nurses in Northern

because we do not know what  to doNurse Anne WatermanSecretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Affairs minister Simon Coveney, who were in talks to finalise the text until am overnight, are urging the parties to sign up to suggested proposals to address the vexed issues at the heart of the three-year impasse.The briefings followed two roundtable meetings of all five parties convened by Mr Smith and Mr Coveney earlier in the day.The events at Stormont came as Prime Minister Boris Johnson, addressing the Commons, urged the region’s politicians to “take responsibility” and get the institutions up and running again.Ongoing industrial action by health workers has heaped pressure on the political leaders to get back into a devolved Assembly.Thousands of nurses are on picket lines at hospitals across the country amid a dispute over pay and staffing shortages.Anne Waterman, , a staff nurse striking outside the Ulster Hospital, less than a mile from the gates of Stormont, delivered a stark message to the rowing politicians.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith has been working with Irish Foreign Affairs minister Simon Coveney on the proposals “If I was to stop working for three years I would not be getting paid, I think politicians here really have to step up to the mark, speak up for us and support us because we do not know what  to do,” she said.The last DUP Sinn Fein-led coalition government collapsed in January  over a row about a botched green energy scheme.That dispute subsequently widened to take in more traditional wrangles on matters such as the Irish language and the thorny legacy of the Troubles.Proposed legislative protections for Irish language speakers and reform of a contentious Stormont voting mechanism – called the petition of concern – have been the crucial sticking points in the most recent talks process, which got under way following the UK general election.Sinn Fein has previously demanded a stand-alone Irish Language Act as a prerequisite of any deal to restore devolution.The DUP has expressed a willingness to legislate to protect the language, but only as part of broader culture laws which also include the Ulster Scots tradition.The long-running dispute has boiled down to whether new laws are contained in a stand-alone Bill or as part of a wider piece of legislation."},{"url":null,"title":"alliance leader naomi long to return to stormont","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

Incredible. And unforgivable.”Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan wrote on Twitter: “People say I’m too critical of Meghan Markle – but she ditched her family, ditched her Dad, ditched most of her old friends, split Harry from William and has now split him from the Royal Family. I rest my case.”"},{"url":null,"title":"harry and meghan to step down as senior royals","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We need people who know what it takes to deliver jobs and investment in this city - this is a signal of our intent to deliver for Derry. googletag.cmd.push Sinead McLaughlin said: “It has been an honour and an immense privilege to represent people on Derry and Strabane Council over the last year. I am deeply grateful for all those who I’ve worked with and I look forward to building on those relationships as I take on this new challenge. “This is a critical time for Derry. The extraordinary potential of this city and our people has been left undeveloped for far too long. My priority is delivering new jobs, investment and infrastructure that will provide everyone living here with the opportunity to fulfil their ambitions. It starts with the expansion of our university to give young people the chance to study, work and build a le for themselves here.

Here is how the Slaughtneil players performed. Oisin ODoherty – Could do little about either of Colin Fennellys goals or the two that he missed. His handling was assured. Two of his puck-outs to Rogers on the wing ended in important Slaughtneil scores. Cormac McKenna – Picked up Eoin Reid and held him to a point. Got caught in possession when trying to clear his lines late on. It was his instinctive pass that placed Seaacuten Oacute Caiside for a point. Sean Cassidy – Had a testing hour on Colin Fennelly. Got drawn to TJ Reid on the first goal but did well to stop him on the run for a second goal in the first-half but couldnt stop his incessant drives forward. googletag.cmd.push Seaacuten Oacute Caiside – Conceded two points to Eoin Cody in the first-half and cleared a ball for Ronan Corcoran for a point before being switched onto Brian Cody at the break. Lofted over a terric score from range, cleared plenty of ball and unlucky to be replaced. Meehaul McGrath – Lost his man Brian Cody for a point and lost possession for another before being assigned to Adrian Mullen who he held scoreless in the second-half. Put himself about under the breaking ball and his point started their comeback from five down. Shane McGuigan – Given the task of curbing TJ Reid. Held him to a point from play but Reid was central to the move for Fennellys first goal. Overall a strong performance at the heart of Slaughtneils defence. googletag.cmd.push Karl McKaigue – Began on Eoin Cody from the throw-in but sent straight onto Adrian Mullen who he limited to two touches of the ball in the first-half. Switched inside to the dangerous Eoin Cody at the interval who he also held scoreless. Gerald Bradley – Put in a terric sht. Played the sweeper role when Ballyhale were in possession but pushed up on Ronan Corcoran for puck-outs. Swept up a mountain of ball but a short clearance led to a score for Patrick Mullen in the second-half. Chrissy McKaigue – Buzzed forward to land the games opening score and added a neat second in the first-half. His man, Conor Walsh, was replaced at half-time. Once again showed his class It was an energetic hour overall from the skipper who led the comeback. Brian Cassidy – Went through a mountain of work in the first-half between midfield and wing-forward, putting the highly rated Richie Reid on the defensive who failed to get on the scoreboard. His sideline cut let to Slaughtneils first goal. Won every ball played to him and chipped in with three points. Cormac ODoherty – Was picked up initially by Michael Fennelly and later Darragh Corcoran. Missed a long range free and crucial one but fired over some breath-taking efforts and worked tirelessly throughout. His turnover setup a point for Brendan Rogers, his vision made one for Seacute McGuigan and a pass put Cassidy in on goal. Mark McGuigan – Conceded - to his direct wing-back Evan Shefflin but had the unselfish sht of having to double up on Ronan Corcoran when Gerald Bradley was dropping back and Brian Cassidy was on the front foot. Went through a lot of unseen work and passed to Cassidy for Slaughtneils last score. Brendan Rogers – He started off inside but it wasnt too long before Michael Fennelly was moved onto him. He pulled wide for puck-outs. One led to him burning Richie Reid and Adrian Mullen for a point. Another led to his cracking goal. He was brilliant. Seacute McGuigan – Passed to Chrissy McKaigue for the opening scores, got a flick to Brian Cassidys sideline to setup Jerome McGuigans goal. Had a great battle with Darren Mullen. Got on the scoreboard in the second-half and was fouled for a free during Slaughtneils comeback. Jerome McGuigan – Got free from former Kilkenny defender Joey Holden to unceremoniously hammer home a sixth minute goal to ignite Slaughtneils challenge. Won a free during Slaughtneils purple patch. Shot a wide in the second-half and didnt get close to hurt Ballyhales defence. SUBConor McAllister – Came into Slaughtneils defence for the last  minutes as a replacement for Seaacuten Oacute Caiside.

His kick-outs were ied and accurate.  – Karl McKaigue Adrian Mullen scored - in Ballyhales campaign but McKaigue kept him to just two touches in the first-half before also holding Eoin Cody scoreless after the break.  – Shane McGuigan Tasked with picking up TJ Reid, McGuigan held him to a point from play and followed him when he went to full-back after half-time. An imposing performance. googletag.cmd.push  - Pearse Dallas Dallas held Conaghys Bill Murphy scoreless in Saturdays All-Ireland semi-final. As his side gathered early second-half momentum, he got involved in their plans.  – Enda Downey More renowned as a forward, Downey basked in the freedom of a role at wing-back where his relentless workrate helped Lavey build from defence.  – Gerald Bradley – Swept up a series of Ballyhale attacks in the first-half of Sundays epic All-Ireland semi-final clash. Pushed up on Ronan Corcoran for Dean Masons puck-outs.   – Conleth McShane McShane was the dynamo in the middle third for Derry Us draw against Donegal. He saw a goal chance come off the post and passed to Tiarnaacuten McHugh for his goal. googletag.cmd.push  – Chrissy McKaigue If anyone wanted to know the pitch of Slaughtneils challenge, they needed to look no further than the skippers opening point and he led by example throughout. He was dominant on Conor Walsh before the Ballyhale man was replaced at the break.  – Jamie Duggan For the second game in a row, he blotted out the oppositions star man but his time he weighed in with two points to put Lavey on track for Ulster glory.  - SL McGoldrick Landed - in the Eoghan Rua cause and played deep to counteract the Conahy midfield influence but was still able to contribute to their attacking game.  – Finatan Bradley Bradley was an effective link in Derrys half-forward line. He handled more than his fair share of possession. Was moved to centre-back late on and the Oakleafers missed him when he was black-carded.  – Kealan Friel The Bellaghy man thumped over a brilliant score but wasnt afraid to muck in and work. His long kicking bypassed Donegals sweeper and he used his strength to stop the runner in the first-half.  - Calum Downey For the third game of Laveys run to Ulster glory, Downey was the fulcrum of their attack. Every ball played in stuck to him and he scored two vital points of his own.  – Brendan Rogers Rogers started inside but still was able to peel wide and win puck-outs. He scored a point off his left side, before hitting a wonder score off this right at the end of a lung-busting run and his inidual goal gave Slaughtneil a chance of victory late on.  - Brian Cassidy Cassidy kept his best performance of the season for the biggest challenge that came knocking on the Slaughtneil door. Pinged three points and put Richie Reid on the back foot throughout. Worked hard to cover midfield when Gerald Bradley dropped back.

The event will take place in the Guildhall on Monday,  January, from .pm-.pm and all interested groups are invited to attend.In a recent conference over  representatives from PEACE IV Council funded programmes on both sides of the border met in the Waterfoot Hotel. The event offered the opportunity to share learnings from the current PEACE IV programmes delivered through Derry City and Strabane and Donegal County Councils. The current PEACE IV EU funded programme runs until December this year and is managed by the Special EU Programmes Bodywith match-funding from the Executive Office NI. “In the current programme we’ve pound. million of projects stretching geographically across the Derg, the Sperrins, Strabane, Faughan, Cityside and Waterside,” said Sue Divin, PEACE IV programme manager with Derry and Strabane Council. She added: ”Conversations around PEACE PLUS are just beginning.“The upcoming SEUPB led information events are a key opportunity for our local groups to speak up and help shape the new programme.”The local cross-border conference also featured insightful guest speaker input from Dr. Martin McMullan and Paddy Boydand Claire Heaney-McKee, The Playhouse Theatre of Witness. “These were really useful perspectives which prompted interesting conver- sations,” said one participant. “Resources provided were useful in considering the best methods to start conversations about peace and the Troubles with young people who do not have signicant information or education around it,’ said another.” The networking event showed a clear consensus that the EU PEACE IV funding in both Council areasis making a signicant dference to local community projects working to promote respect, shared space, understanding and reconciliation. Projects at the event discussed what combined messages they may have for the forthcoming PEACE PLUS consultation from both sides of the border and from across urban and rural perspectives. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

These are the type of creative activities registered childminders do on a daily basis with the children in their care.“It is important that parents think about their choice of childminder. We know that parents ultimately want to keep their children safe, and some parents will feel that they have a choice to make between using a registered childminder or an unregistered childminder. However, quite simply there is no choice. “The law is very clear, anybody looking after children for more than two hours a day, for reward, must register with the Health and Social Care Trust. “Registered childminders will have completed Access NI Checks on all iniduals in the household over the age of  and will have Public Liability insurance cover. “A registered childminder will also be required to update mandatory training every three years. They will be registered by the Trust and inspected on an annual basis by early years social workers. These checks help to keep your child safe, so you really should carefully consider who is looking after your child. In addition, NICMA provide advice and work in partnership with other organisations such as Family Support NI and the Western Childcare Partnership , who detail local services and information to support you and your family.” Patricia adds: “We hope that this campaign will also prompt unregistered childminders to become registered. By completing the relevant mandatory training, Access NI checks and getting public liability insurance in place, they will be helping to not only keep the children in their care safe, but to protect themselves.”During -, the Childcare Partnerships commissioned several regional organisations to undertake a review of the issues impacting on their specic areas of the childcare sector. NICMA reviewed the Childminding sector and identied the need to increase awareness amongst parents of the benefits of engaging a registered childminder to look after their children. The Western Childcare Partnership was approached for funding to implement a campaign within the Western Trust area for this purpose, which they were happy to support.Over a four year period the Western Health and Social Care Trustarea has seen a decline in registered childminders from  in March  to  in March last year.  This represents a decrease of % and a reduction of  day care places in the WHSCT area.For further information please contact Grainne Scullion, childminding development and engagement officer for NICMA in the Western Trust, on    or email grainne.scullion@ nicma.org. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He said: The concentration of new inward investment in areas outside the Greater Belfast Area is essentialwe are to stem the flow of emigration and get new highly paid jobs into Coleraine, Limavady and Ballykelly where the potential is unlimited.This requires clever and imaginative use of Growth Deal Funding and other financial packages which generate new investment. We cannot sit back and curse the darkness. Invest Northern Ireland have, to their credit been organising events at the Coleraine Campus of Ulster University and carrying out visits to a number of companies and that is most welcome.However, the small number of bespoke visits over the last three years does indicate that more must be done and any new assembly needs to address regional disparities in new investment, identy the reasons why and change their sales pitch because I believe that East Derry has amazing potential for any inward investor who needs reliable employees, well-educated with good work ethics and supported by excellent schools, colleges and the university. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The question of hard work and talent never really comes into it. It kind of explains why bands are hyped up and then disappear. I could give you a list of never-weres, but we all forget them. The same goes for management and record labels. Luckily, there are exceptions to every rule. Unfortunately, though, here, following their farewell show on the th of January  at the Empire Music Hall, Belfast-based indie label Quiet Arch will begin a period of indefinite hiatus.Quiet Arch is the youngling of Lyndon Stephens, a record label that adapted to the st century music climate, stood on its own two feet, walked and then ran. With a roster of the best that the six counties has to offer the night of celebration will host a line-up of the label’s artists and associates Elma Orkestra and Ryan Vail, Joshua Burnside, Ciaran Lavery, Malojian and newcomers, Laytha. Tickets are available at eventbrite and cost a strange pound. and the show kicks off at seven. The label is the current and former home for many of Northern Irelands most successful artists - Joshua Burnside, Ryan Vail, Ciaran Lavery, Beauty Sleep and many others - the music enterprise will take a step back from label operations and, as yet, no formal plans for the future have been confirmed. I should say that there is also a managerial arm called Championship Sound management which I’d like you not to get confused with the record label. They’re two separate things and I’ll be getting to that part some other time.In recognition of their achievements, Quiet Arch will organise a showcase from their catalogue of artists. Headlined by NI Music Prize “Best Album” winners Elma Orkestra and Ryan Vail, as well as former winners Joshua Burnside and Ciaran Lavery, the night will be serve as a celebration of the impact that Quiet Arch has had on the music industry and landscape of its native Northern Ireland. In lieu of label services, management and curation of several Quiet Arch artist will be transferred to New Champion, the management arm of the label spearheaded by Francesca O’Connor and Ben Magee.Eoin O’Callaghan said: “Quite Arch was the label for our BORDERS release. It was BORDERS’ home. Any creative ideas we had were always ran through Quiet Arch because we cared for their opinion and quite often, they would inspire us to keep raising the bar with the content we created. Quiet Arch to me was three people... Lyndon, Francesca and Ben.”Record labels come and go, they always have and always will. Probably more so in today’s musical environment it can be tough for these operations to survive but the most impressive thing about Quiet Arch to me is that they grew and went from strength to strength when others just faded away or desperately try to work out what relevance is. Lyndon and co have nurtured a thing of beauty that has been a place for the likes of Ciaran Lavery and Joshua Burnside to develop and realise a vision worthy of all the accolades. The kind of integrity and determination to stick to your guns is probably the reason they have succeeded where so many others have failed.I have had many a conversation with Lyndon about the general condition of Northern Ireland music and always found him to be supportive of every angle. He has been supportive in some of my Facebook rants and has been the voice of reason when necessary on some of my others. In sum, there are those who do in this place and there are those who do a wile lot of talking about doing stuff and that has always been what sets Quiet Arch apart from the others. They just do stuff. It’s not like I’m into all of it, but that isn’t the point is it  In case you don’t believe me, I’ll let Ryan Vail have the final word: “Quiet Arch has been the home for my music for the last five years. “It’s taken my music across the world. It’s been a success story for most of the acts in its roster. “To see it go is a devastating blow to the NI music scene. What it leaves behind is proof that an independent record label can work here  should inspire more.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His close friends and running colleagues tried every trick in the book to ascertain the route for the annual Castlewellan Christmas Cracker, but uncharacteristically lsquoThe Prophetrsquo remained tight-lipped and taciturn. The usual platitudes and prosaicisms were thrown out by way of appeasement, but they threw no light on the course that has been in the planning since January .Phrases like, lsquothere is something for everyonersquo, lsquothere will be a few good climbsrsquo, lsquowe will go through a field or tworsquo and lsquoI still have a few ditches to clearrsquo served only to add intrigue and mystique to the potential route.From am, parking spaces were snaffled up as the growing crowds made their way to collect their numbers, totally unaware of what lay ahead, another unique characteristic of this now iconic event.When we go to races we usually know what lies ahead as it will be the same as the previous year mdash not so with this one.This led to great speculation at registration and the passing of spurious rumours, lsquoIrsquove heard it is Foxes green firstrsquo, lsquoBunkerrsquos Hill is the first climbrsquo, lsquothe gates at Niall Kingrsquos place are open and that can only mean one thing!rsquoThose unwise enough to listen were tormented, while the more sanguine took it all in their stride realising that what would be would be.The atmosphere in the GAA club was electric and filled with excitement as every little corner became a changing space and in the middle of all of this Stevie Rice had set up a stall and had created a monopoly on udderrmint ndash an essential for the discerning runner.With space at a premium, one team had pre-booked the VIP changing facilities in Ned McCartanrsquos front room. Here the gracious, ebullient and effervescent host provided valet parking, bespoke carb-rich pre-race food, handed out warm fluffy towels and proffered words of wisdom and encouragement. The * package was completed with optional dog therapy ndash petting Socks.The  entries were snapped up in a few weeks, such is the popularity of this event among the NI running fraternity.Running in pairs is far from commonplace in what is largely an inidual sport and this certainly brings a welcome new dimension in that you are only as good as your partner and an ill-conceived or sentimental choice could see you standing waiting at the top of a hill, the bottom of a hill or at the finish.The secret lies in getting the right partner, one you know you can work with and whose running skills complement your own ndash a lesson that has still to be learned by a number of this yearrsquos participants.While the event is a great opportunity to dress up, socialise and enjoy the wonderful scenery that Castlewellan has to offer, the racing at the sharp end of the field is seriously fierce.From the moment they were set on their way at the bottom of the Circular Road, the cream rose to the top as the leading teams thundered their way through the town at breakneck speed.Getting good road position at the front is essential for the leading men and women.In , Newcastlersquos Lynch and Hanna were clear winners with a minute and a half to spare over Johnston and Scott of Mourne Runners, with McMullan and Stephens, from the host club, a further  seconds back in third.These three teams were paired once again, but had to settle for second, third and fth respectively. With Hanna in the form of his le and regularly representing Ireland in the hills and Lynch coming off a superb  minute k at the Seeley, they were the in-form team and pre-race favourites.However, favourites do not always win and on this occasion it was Aaron McGrady from East Down and his partner Andrew Barrington, originally from Oban in Scotlandwho emerged victorious.The pair, who run and race together for Victoria Park Harriers in London, were among a group of leaders along the Crow Road.As the course rose steeply after the Moorish Tower, the pair was second behind Lynch and Hanna as they hurtled through the fields towards the Bannanstown Road.As was the case in , the climb over the Playrock Hill would prove decisive and the eventual winners managed to pull away and open a winning lead.However, McGrady admits that once they hit the front, they had to work very hard over the last three miles as they knew the quality of the team chasing them.When asked about the course, the winner said that it was very dferent to previous years, was far less muddy than anticipated and despite the steep hills offered great opportunities for hard fast running.Overall, he considered it to be a well-planned and carefully balanced route. McKinstry was always in contention, but his partner suffered terribly and put paid to their chances of the win ndash they would finish fourth overall.Beechmount Harriers claimed the ladiesrsquo team prize with Sarah Laverty and Catherine Diver finishing in an excellent th place overall ndash all that training up the hill in Falls Park paid off.They were joined on the podium by Hannah Somani and Georgina Wileyand Amanda Perry and Denise Logue .In the mixed category there was a great win for Shalene McMurray and David McNeilly who were th overall and comfortably clear of their nearest challengers and club mates Mari Troeng and Frank Cunningham. Karen Wilton and Andrew Wills of Jog Lisburn completed the mixed team podium.There were male, female and mixed category winners dotted throughout the field and these are highlighted in the results file available on the Newcastle AC website . Well done to everyone who won a prize.Some of the fancy dress was simply amazing and added greatly to the sense of fun that is central to this race. Special mention to the Power family who once again dressed to impress and the three sheep bleated their way around the course under the ever-watchful eye of Bo Peep, the Newry AC crew who were came as the cast of lsquoIrsquom a Celebrityrsquo, but regrettably failed to get out of there and had to complete all nine miles and the Grant family and their friends who looked lsquoCrackingrsquo for the Cracker.Costumes came in all shapes and sizes with superheroes galore and even the odd beach ball shoved up a T-shirt for maximum effect.Before we draw the curtain on this event there are some necessary closing remarks.Firstly, we have to mention some of those who were lsquopale facedrsquo as they crossed the finish line.Among this number were Connaire McVeigh, his brother Brian McVeigh, Noel lsquoWonderwallrsquo Gallagher , Dee Murrayand Patrick Higgins who it would seem invented a new shade of grey.While all of these are notable and honourable mentions, there can only be on winner of such a prestigious accolade.The worthy recipient is none other than Dominic lsquoMad Dogrsquo McGreevy, who by his own admission was lsquoclean burstedrsquo by evergreen Jim Brown before they even left the show field.Whilst cogitating the next day with McVeigh, he noted that there was a distinct lack of climbing in the opening mile which considerably reduced his chances of the overall win.Of course, all of this is pure conjecture, passed on to me by others who were better placed to judge. As these pale faced warriors finished, I was probably getting a drink at Stephen McMullanrsquos pop-up tavern in Leitrim.The day was a great success due to the hard work and planning that took place. Course designer McCrickard would like to thank his incredible team that spent the best park of two days marking ndash Francie McAlinden, Audey McVeigh , Aidan Brownand Donal Ward.Thanks also to the entry management and registration team who did so much work in creating and continually updating and modying the team ndash no small task, the marshals from our own club and neighbouring clubs, the lead cyclists from Shimna Wheelers and Kilmegan CC, the motorbike riders, Robert and Paddy, the finish team and the presentation party ndash too many to name inidually, but you all know who you are.In conclusion, the feedback from the , that completed the course was amazingly positive and a great time was had by all. Rumour has it that lsquoThe Prophetrsquo was observed entering the park this morning with a bill hook and a bow saw ndash preparations must be underway for ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Boyle.jpg","title":"Boyle family celebrates as Tom marks milestone 100th birthday  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK man celebrated his th birthday before Christmas.Tom Boyle, the townrsquos former postmaster, became a centenarian on December .He was congratulated by a steady stream of relatives and well-wishers who called to the home he shares with we Maria in a low-key celebration.He is third local man to celebrate his centenary during .Felix Burns, from Rossglass, turned the big  in May, and was followed in August by Roddy Maguire from Downpatrick.All three received congratulatory card from the Queen.

However, all that will count for nothing when they walk out at Seaview this afternoon.Sloan knows more than most that cup finals are all about what happens on the day and no amount of preparation or game planning can change that.With Olympic what you see is what you get.There are no prima donnas in the squad and they have all bought into the team ethos ndash one in, all in.The Olympic boss has made a few shrewd signings since last season and the new faces have gelled well with the group.Olympic may have lost top scorer Niall Murray to Crumlin Star, but Stefan Mason has proved more than a capable replacement.Stefan, now in his second spell at the club, joined from Drumaness Mills at the start of the season and his insatiable appetite in a main strikerrsquos role has endeared him to all.He is a nightmare for all defenders as he never stays still and is continually looking for space. He is not afraid to shoot and is also as brave as they come, adding a bit of physicality to his game in recent times.He has formed a perfect partnership with the under-rated Chris McNamara and the potentially explosive Nathan Jones mdash and all three are reliable matchwinners.Paul Dickson, another new signing, first came to prominence a few years ago when he starred for Noel lsquoDixiersquo Deanrsquos emerging Temple Rangers side that famously reached the semi-finals of the Clarence Cup.Since then he has played for Ballynahinch United and Saintfield United, but his adventurous style of play from the back has given Olympic an added dimension to their play.He has been joined in the squad by Anton McGrattan, a stylish midfielder, who gets up and down the park with ease and who is not an easy player to dispossess or put off his game.Basically, the rest of the Olympic remains the same and therein lies the secret of their success. Goalkeeper Ryan Walsh, a member of the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team, has enhanced his growing reputation this season and he rarely makes mistakes.Manager Sloan has the luxury of being able to play a number of formations at the back. Jason Noade is a colossus in the centre of defence with either Stevie McGoran, Connor Reid, Dickson or the highly-rated Dalton Tate flanking him.Midfield enforcer Ryan Noade,he is fit, can also play in the back four, but he, brother Stevie, Shane Murray and workaholic Ryan Molloy make up a formidable midfield unit with McGrattan able to cover any position in the engine room.Olympic have serious strength in depth and James McClean, Aaron McLean, Adam McClean, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Darren Lyons and Reece McConnell are all ready to step up to the markthey are required.However, standing in Olympicrsquos way is one of their own, now making Rathfriland tick.Andy Kilmartin started out at Olympic as a raw teenager with immense talent.He signed for Glasgow Celtic before moving to Glentoran, Portdown and Glenavon where he won an Irish Cup medal.The martinette is now pulling Rathfrilandrsquos strings alongside Newcastlersquos Jonathan Scannell and Downpatrickrsquos Peter Telford and Ruairi Fitzpatrick.Olympic know these players inside out and given a fair wind, they hope to blow Rathfriland away in what promises to be an intriguing final.Coincidentally, this will be Telfordrsquos fth Border Cup final appearance, but he has yet to appear on a winning side.He has lost three finals with Downpatrick FC and one with Kilmore Rec and is hoping that it will be a case of fth time lucky this afternoon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Out.jpg","title":"Out of Africa book looks at richness of sharing humanity together  ","story":"THE latest book by Downpatrick author Dr Stan Papenfus has just been published.Out of Africa has a title that he plagiarised from Pliny, the ancient Roman writer, who wrote: ldquoOut of Africa always something new.The subtitle of this book, lsquoSharing our livesrsquorsquo, derives from an African proverb mdash lsquoA person is a person through peoplersquo. It an also be translated as lsquoA person becomes a person through peoplersquo.The signicance of this proverb becomes ever more clear in the being and becoming of the three story tellers who share their lives with Dr Papenfus.Each one of them expresses and explores the truth of their own experiences and each one has their personal reality confirmed by the events and situations that unfold. In this telling, they also create how they who are and who they can be.Gabriel Makamanzi, from Zimbabwe, specically sees his own problems and dficulties belonging not merely to himself, but to the whole community in which he lives.This community is brought alive for us as he describes it and he expects us to relate it to our own problems and dficulties. In this way, he says, we all work together to discover our own creative freedom and realise our potential.Gabriel notes that le is for love. And yet, without honesty, our personal and shared reality is not reality at all.Instead, it is a pretense and those of us who pretend he sees us ldquoliving meaningless livesrsquorsquo.Dr Papenfus says: ldquoGabrielrsquos story challenges us, as it challenged him, to recognise our own poverty and despair, only to realise the spiritual power and richness of sharing our humanity with each other.The next exploration of time experiences is by Zakele Makaluza, from South Africa. He talks about his arrogance and his refusal to heed the warnings given to him by his ancestors, as they appear to him in his dreams.Zakelersquos experiences also refer to his relationship with bees, but not ordinary bees, rather with those ldquogentlemen of the honeyrsquorsquo sent by his ancestors to remind him of his duties to others, especially to members of his own clan.Dr Stan said: ldquoZakele, in his exploration of his experiences, brings us to an awareness of our own integrity or lack or integrity, in ourselves and in our relationship with others. He realises his potential only after he is persuaded of a certain truth, which he has been denying nearly all his le.ldquoIt is his cousin who opens up his awareness and tells him also that this was an experience that were lsquodestinedrsquo to share.The last person giving his testimony in the book is David Maganda, from Uganda. He came from a very big family and when his father died he was left to fend for himself, especially with regard to earning enough money to pay for his education.Even as a young boy, he secretly took a train from Uganda to Kenya, hoping to make enough money to sponsor his schooling. But, instead, he found himself on a ldquomission impossible as he calls it.He and his friend found themselves stranded and virtually penniless in the city of Nairobi. They had no place to stay, no work and no friends.How are they toto Uganda  They found themselves walking for mile after mile, along long and dusty roads, depending for their very survival on the kindness and pity of strangers. After living through a fierce storm and other hardships, they eventually arrived at the Kenya-Uganda border. Here, in their completely squalid state, they were interrogated by the police, who eventually let them cross the border.Arriving back in Uganda, they miraculously met Davidrsquos friendrsquos sister, who was working at a trading station. And so, at last, they find themselves able tohome.Each of their families get them to promise never again to engage in such a mad exploit. And yet within ten years he finds himself stranded once again, this time in the Sudan.Here, however, he is able to make do by earning money and pursuing some schooling and eventually being presented with a graduation certicate. Because of the particular school he attended, he was also able to become a confirmed Christian. However, he discovers, through his interaction with others, that his Christianity is only lukewarm.Through many strange encounters he eventually learns how to accept Christ into his very heart of hearts.As a result of this, he preaches the good news of salvation and in Northern Sudan he is even beaten and imprisoned.As time goes by he meets his we, Gillian, at a theological college in England. Today, David lives in Belfast and is only a lay preacher, but also someone who teaches others how to explore and discover the meaning of their lives and with others, how to realise their potential.Out of Africa is available on loan from Downpatrick Library and can also be bought from amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Seals.jpg","title":"Seals prosper in Strangford Lough  ","story":"STRANGFORD Lough is proving to be a popular nursery for grey seals.The largest sea inlet in Ireland can boast having  pups born in its waters during last autumn, the most since records began almost  years ago.The National Trust, which records the number of wildle visiting the area, revealed there were  adults in the lough at the peak of the breeding season last year ndash something of a turnaround for the protected species.In the early s records show that only around six or seven grey seals were born in the area each year.Lead ranger at Strangford Lough Hugh Thurgate say several factors have contributed to the growth in numbers.He said: ldquoThe boom reflects the burgeoning population in Scottish waters which is pushing the population down the North Channel and into the Irish Sea and seals are being forced to seek out new places to breed.ldquoThe shelter of Strangford is a strong draw for seals on the look-out for alternative spots to relax on shore during the breeding and moulting seasons.Mr Thurgate agrees that Strangford Lough is just the place for them.He added: ldquoThe seals are looking for a safe and protected place to raise their young ndash somewhere that provides protection from the elements and is relatively free from disturbance ndash which Strangford Lough offers.ldquoPups are quite vulnerable.

They’re continually digging up unexploded bombs throughout Germany. “Through in-laws of my brother, who married in Germany, I spoke to someone who was on the Russian front. I got a lot of information close to the wire plus a lot of research.“People have reviewed the book, went through it with a fine-tooth comb and commended its accuracy.”Explaining how the book led to him crossing paths with Angela Merkel he said: “Writing a period historical novel requires a lot of research for the product to be authentic enough for the reader to believe in it and to buy into the plot. “The story begins north of Berlin, at a hotel situated on the shores of Großdöllner See, in the district of New Brandenburg. It was during this time that I discovered the chancellor had grown up in the area with her family.“I sent her a letter of appreciation for her service as a politician, along with a copy of my book for her and her husband to read on her retirement.“Just before Christmas, I received a letter of thanks from her office.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He met two men at a hotel and then took a bullet train to Osaka before boarding a private jet hidden inside a case for musical equipment. He flew to Istanbul and was then transferred on to another plane bound for Beirut, where he arrived on December .Ghosn portrayed his arrest as a plot linked to a decline in the financial performance of Nissan. He had been in favour of merging Nissan with industry ally Renault, of which he was also chairman. --Grab of a photo made available by IHA of packing crates, one of which IHA claims Carlos Ghosn used to hide to escape from Japan  --ldquoUnfortunately there was no trust. And some of our Japanese friends thought that the only way to get rid of Renault in Nissan is to get rid of me, he said.ldquoI should never have been arrested in the first place, he said.ldquoIrsquom not above the law and I welcome the opportunity for the truth to come out and have my name cleared, he told a packed room of journalists.Ghosn said he would be ready to stand trial ldquoanywhere where I think I can have a fair trial. He declined to say what country that might be.Lebanon last week received an Interpol-issued wanted notice ndash a non-binding request to law enforcement agencies worldwide that they locate and provisionally arrest a fugitive.Lebanon and Japan do not have an extradition treaty, and the Interpol notice does not require Lebanon to arrest him. Lebanese authorities have said Ghosn entered the country on a legal passport, casting doubt on the possibility they would hand him over to Japan. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Carlos Ghosn faces the media  --At the request of the Japanese government, Interpol published the notice on its website on Wednesday as Ghosn was giving his news conference. The notice was previously only sent to Interpolrsquos member governments but not shared with the public.Ghosn, who is Lebanese and also holds French and Brazilian passports, was expected to go on trial in Tokyo in April. In earlier statements, he has said he fled to avoid ldquopolitical persecution by a ldquorigged Japanese justice system. He also said that he alone organised his departure from Japan and that his we Carole played no role.On Tuesday, Tokyo prosecutors obtained an arrest warrant for Mrs Ghosn on suspicion of perjury. That charge is not related to his escape. Lebanonrsquos justice minister said Lebanon has not received any request related to that warrant. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Journalists outside the house of Carlos Ghosn in Beirut  --Japanese justice officials acknowledge that it is unclear whether the Ghosns can be brought back to Japan to face charges.Ghosnrsquos former employer, Nissan Motor Co, said it was still pursuing legal action against him despite his escape, adding that Ghosn engaged in serious misconduct while leading the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance. Ghosn denies all the charges.In France, meanwhile, prosecutors are investigating a ,-eurogt from the chateau of Versailles to Ghosn, linked to a lavish party there. Renault alerted French authorities after a company investigation found that Ghosn personally benefited from ldquoan exchange worth , euros in the framework of a philanthropic accord signed with the Chateau of Versailles.Renault said in June that an internal audit with partner Nissan found  million eurosin questionable expenses at their Dutch-based holding linked to Ghosn. The two carmakers recommended legal action in the Netherlands, where the alliance is based, and ordering Ghosn himself to reimburse the company for some of the expenses.Earlier in the day, Tokyo prosecutors raided a Japanese lawyerrsquos office where Ghosn had visited regularly before he fled.  -- vw,vw,px, px\"Carlos Ghosn and his we Carole  --Japanese media reports said prosecutors were likely to have seized a computer to track down how Ghosn escaped and who might have helped him.An hour before the scheduled press conference, a Lebanese prosecutor said Ghosn will be summoned ldquoin the coming hours over a visit to Israel more than  years ago, according to the state-run National News Agency.Two Lebanese lawyers had submitted a report to the Public Prosecutorrsquos Office against Ghosn last week, saying he violated Lebanese law by visiting Israel. The two neighbouring countries are technically in a state of war. Prosecutor Ghassan Khoury met with the two lawyers who filed the case on Wednesday and asked them to bring additional evidence, adding he would summon Ghosn in the coming hours.Ghosn visited Israel in  and met officials including the prime minister and the president.

The study also notes that the UKrsquos young people are ldquomiles behind their European peers in foreign languages, with just a third able to speak more than just their mother tongue.And it warns that post-Brexit, language skills cannot be ignored, and the UK cannot rely on the assumption that the rest of the world speaks English.The study says there has been a huge drop in demand for language learning in recent years.ldquoIn England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the scrapping of the compulsory foreign language GCSE in  has had a detrimental effect on national uptake levels, the paper says.ldquoThis measure failed to anticipate the vast drop in uptake. ldquoGiven fewer than half of pupils now take a GCSE foreign language, compared to % in , we are far behind the rest of Europe, and changes in governmental attitudes and policy are pressing. The author calculates that at GCSE, entries for French have dropped by % since , while German entries have fallen %.There has been a rise in the numbers taking Spanish over this period, overtaking German in , and last year there was an overall rise in the numbers taking modern foreign languages.The report also says that entries for French and German A-level have been falling since the mid-s, and there has been a fall in recent years in the numbers applying to study certain languages at university.The falls are having an impact on the languages ldquopipeline, the report suggests, affecting the numbers of language graduates and trained teachers. This, along with reductions in EU school staff, will threaten languages in schools, it says.The study concludes: ldquoThe assumption that lsquothe rest of the world speaks Englishrsquo hinders new international collaborations and overlooks cultural and cognitive enhancement developed by learning.ldquoPolitical developments mean change is more pressing. If the UK is to thrive outside the EU, language skills cannot be ignored ndash the UK must address educational declines and capitalise on lsquountapped reservoirs of linguistic capacityrsquo.ldquoIt is crucial that ancient and modern languages receive support in schools and higher education. The report puts forward a series of recommendations, including calling for foreign language study to be compulsory at GCSE level, with youngsters encouraged, but not obliged to take an accredited GCSE or alternative qualication.Report author Megan Bowler, a third-year Classics undergraduate at the University of Oxford, said: ldquoIt was a big mistake to scrap compulsory foreign languages at GCSE.ldquoRather than continuing to present languages as not suitable for everyone, we need to include a broader range of pupils learning through a iety of qualications geared to dferent needs.Nick Hillman, HEPI director said: ldquoThe decision to limit language learning in schools by making GCSE languages voluntary is probably the single most damaging education policy implemented in England so far this century.ldquoThe UK is bottom of the pile for the number of young people familiar with another language, and miles behind every EU country.A Department for Education spokesman said: ldquoWe are committed to ensuring more pupils are studying languages, which is why it is compulsory for all children between years three and nine.ldquoThe introduction of the EBacc halted the decline in languages and since  the proportion of pupils studying a language at GCSE has risen from % to % in . ldquoWe are also taking a range of steps to make sure that the uptake of languages continues to increase, such as creating a new network of schools and funding programmes like our Mandarin Excellence Programme..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: UK youngsters  umiles behind u European peers in foreign language learning article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sam, the third child of Norman and Jean Hewitt,was raised on a farm at Moneypennys and it was there thathis love for the outdoor le was nurtured. He would often recall his early days there, telling stories of sailing to Portadown along the canal on his canoe and spending hours in the fields observing the wildle along the river banks. It was there too that his spirit of adventure developed which ultimately led to a career in the Royal Air Force and a posting to Germany where he served for three years, developing a love for that country. That career was relived when the family gave him a trip in a Spitfire for his th birthday and Sam was delighted when the trip was featured on Anne Marie McAleese’s Radio Ulster programme Your Place and Mine. Having obtained a pilot’s licence earlier in le he enjoyed lots of flying time from Aldergrove and there were frequent trips to the Isle of Man with his we, Margaret, and daughter Claire.As a child and teenager Sam developed a close relationship with local horse dealers, the Hamill family, and this gave him the opportunity to ride horses, which became a le-long passion, passed on to daughter Claire and grandchildren Olivia and Rocco.Family was the most important aspect of Sam’s le and he and Margaret had three children, Claire, born in , Reuben in i and Samuel in . He was totally devoted to them, opening up opportunities for each ofthem to pursue a range of activities ranging from horse-riding to fishing and motor bikes and all sorts of watersports. And although Samuel was based in England there was nothing he enjoyed more than to arrive at Annahugh House and see his children play with the model trains Sam had so lovingly built.Because of his love for horses Sam was involved in the founding of the Armagh Horse and Pony Club and instigated pony camps for children in the Mourne Mountains. Until recently he wasa constant supporter of grandchildren Robin, Alex and Jude at rugby and cricket. Sam’s career was as colourful as his le. On leaving the Air Force he worked at Quintin Castle in Portaferry as the land steward where he continued his horse riding and began to sail and fish in Strangford Lough. Then he was a car salesman with Allens Automart, where he formed a lasting friendship with the owner, George Allen, and John Ford he dabbled for a while as a carpet salesman with Cyril Lord’s Carpets, then there was a spell as a paint salesman in Bridge Street before he went into business on his own with the Superglaze business in Meadow Lane. And all the while Sam’s infectious enthusiasm for whatever he did warmed him to everyone with whom he came in contact, forming a close relationship with the late Victor Locke who had emigrated to Hong Kong. Debonair Sam was an immaculate dresser and had a wardrobe to fit every occasion, whether it was a wedding, a funeral, a formal invitation or a sporting occasion and he stood out from a crowd with his sleek, silver hair.He was also a car enthusiast, his interest having been fostered at Allen’s Automart and he cut a dash as he enjoyed top-range sports cars over the years. Travel was another of his passions and he had been to Vietnam, Africa, America, where he toured the Grand Canyon, Thailand, Hong Kong andChina  But Sam will be best remembered for his friendship and there have been many tributes to him. He enjoyed his weeklylunch date with a group of friends, a get-together that been going on for some  years and one of that gathering, Ron Mullen, said, “Sam was a one-off. He was a wonderful friend and he always had the ability to brighten any gathering, no matter the circumstances. He will be sadly missed.”Retired school headmaster Jim Smart’s friendship with Sam goes back over  years and Jim said, “Sam was a frequent visitor to our house in Mandeville Street where my father ran a potato business. My mother always had the teapot on and we enjoyed seeing Sam arrive and giving us a bit of the fun that was part of his character.”Sam brought fun no matter where he went but he had his serious side too and his RAF training in discipline and decorum could come into play when the occasion demanded. He was comfortable in any gathering and was equally at home discussing world affairs or more mundane matters at home.People like George Allen, Ralph Loney and Mervyn Gilpin, all known for their Christian views, were among Sam’s best friends, even though he didn’t share all their views, but there was mutual respect on all sides and their friendship grew over the years.“Sam was a deep thinker and liked to argue his case,” said Mervyn. “I don’t think we ever saw eye to eye but we had a friendship that could never be broken and we all held him in the highest regard.” Sam is survived by his we, Margaret, daughter Claire, sons Reuben and Samuel, son-in-law Mark, daughters-in-law Zara and Lucy grandchildren Robin, Olivia, Alex, Rocco, Jude, Charlie and William, sister, Jeanette and brother Trevor.The funeral is to Roselawn Crematorium on Friday at pm and donations in lieu of flowers are to Help the Heroes, c oJoseph Poots funeral directors, , Bridge Street, Portadown. BT RAThe family wishes to place on record their sincere thanks to the doctors and nurses at Craigavon Hospital for all their care and attention to Sam during his short stay there.\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"weve been charging our phones wrong all these years best way ","story":"You can now buy Percy Pig dessert sauce from MSDream tie ‘special’ honour for Hanover captain Gary Topley after double cruciate nightmareNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsWeve been charging our phones wrong all these years - this is the best wayBy Group ReporterMonday, th January , : am\"Charging our phones should be one of the easiest and most simplest tasks in the world.Its the end of the day and youre just doing the last bit of browsing on your phone before falling asleep.The battery is slowly draining to empty and you know youll need it on full power tomorrow.So, you plug it into your charger, leave it by your bedside table and wait until the following morning to see a satisfying  per cent battery.However, according to Cadex, this is not the best way to charge your phone.The company, that offers devices that test smartphone batteries, runs its own Battery University website which gives some useful tips on how to keep your smartphones battery healthy.First spotted by Business Insider, Battery University warns that charging your phone to  per cent or overnight is not the best course of action.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

John Mulgrew met him at Terry’s Killaney Estate to discuss the grand whiskey and gin producing plans There’s nothing about Terry Cross and Derek Hardy’s plans for the Hinch Distillery and visitor centre in Co Down that feels like any corners are being cut.Former Delta Print and Packaging boss Terry has turned his attention to whiskey and gin with his new venture – a £m development based literally beside his grand home, outside Carryduff.Looking at a host of detailed artist’s impressions – on show inside Terry’s home – it’s clear there’s both signicant time and money being put in to the venture. It will end up as a , sq ft facility and visitor experience with a bar, restaurant andspaces.Derek is the man who will run the business. He’s been involved in the drinks trade for years, turning his hand to a range of roles, from wine to fizzy water.“It’s a single malt distillery, and the other important part of it is the visitor centre. It’s really our brand home,” Derek told Ulster Business.“It’s about showing off Hinch and showing off Co Down. It allows us to hold events. There is a , sq ft internal courtyard, so we would be able to host - people for an event… our imagination is boundless.“In terms of test distilling, we will start our test around February March and be in production by April or May.”The current Hinch whiskey on the market is coming from a range of sources – already aged. The grain element in the whiskey coming from Great Northern Distillery.“We have tried to look for our niche. In our Time collection, it’s about aged blends. We have our three, five and -year-old sherry finish, a -year-old Amarone which is in the cask already, then finishing up with a -year-old in that range.“Because of the close relationships with the distilleries which have sourced this from, with the grain element we will continue to buy the same grain that was used in those whiskies. We reckon we can pretty much duplicate what we currently have, in the future.“We also have ambitions to launch our signature, single malt range, coming out of the distillery.”As far as output goes, it should be able to produce , litres of pure alcohol, single malt, but that number could soar to two million with extra mash tuns.Derek’s own career has taken him to global food giants such as Unilever, working specically for Batchelors foods, before moving to the then SmithKline Beecham as an account manager.His first move into the alcohol and beverage sector was with wine company Ernest and Julio Gallo where he spent four years. A stint at Ballygowan spring water followed.It’s also due to launch the first of its ‘craft beer’ range. That will see it ageing whiskey in barrels from Irish breweries including Heaney, Kinnegar and Whitewater.And as whiskey takes at least three years to develop, Hinch is also producing a gin – Ninth Wave. According to Derek, they spent around four or five months developing a series of recipes, before deciding on what will now be their own premium gin.It’s also Derek’s penchant for ancient history, dating back to Celtic times, that inspired the gin’s name. It comes from the Celtic form of heaven, ‘the other world’.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
