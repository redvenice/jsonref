The Falcon was their second most expensive jet.But a customer service agent at Clay Lacy told DailyMail.com that they had no charter flights on record for the Falcon on Saturday – meaning Harry and Meghan\u0027s flight was provided by the airplane\u0027s owner Guthy-Renker, not the charter service.The firm\u0027s two founders, Bill Guthy and Greg Renker, both have properties in Carpinteria near the Sussexes\u0027 mansion in Santa Barbara, and are worth over $500million each.     Cindy Crawford and the Meaningful Beauty Infomercial (FULL) - YouTube"},{"url":null,"title":"Mother left motorcyclist lying middle road handed 12 month driving ban","story":"Share this article The Middlesbrough court heard how the motorcyclist was \u0027left lying on the floor\u0027 and was \u0027very worried about lorries coming towards him\u0027 as he was wearing dark clothing.Ms Butt told how the victim felt that he was \u0027lucky a car or lorry didn\u0027t drive over him\u0027.He was taken to James Cook University Hospital by the ambulance service by \u0027sheer luck\u0027 after a car, with two nurses, stopped at the scene.The victim remained in hospital for two weeks after suffering major injuries including a dislocated hip, multiple fractures in his wrist as well as a number of small injuries.He required surgery to repair his hip and wrist - and is now waiting to find out if he needs a hip replacement.The prosecutor said he is still \u0027suffering a lot of pain\u0027 and has restricted mobility since the smash.The victim is also having \u0027flashbacks\u0027 and \u0027recalls flying through the air\u0027 and was lucky he wasn\u0027t \u0027struck by a lorry and killed\u0027.Ms Butt added that Ms Soakell, previously from Easington lane, Houghton-le-Spring, has no previous convictions and stated the Crown Prosecution Service would not be applying for compensation as it is being dealt with by insurance companies.Paul McAlindon, mitigating, told how Ms Soakell had a witness to \u0027support her account\u0027 but they were awaiting covid-19 test results on the day of trial and the trial went ahead in their absence.He described the expecting mother as a \u0027young lady who has never been in trouble before\u0027 and has \u0027lost her good character\u0027.Mr McAlindon told the district judge how the defendant is a full-time community carer, covering the whole of the Durham area, and has worked throughout the pandemic.The \u0027busy young woman\u0027 is also due to give birth in January.The defence solicitor stated that Ms Soakell\u0027s driving licence is \u0027essential\u0027 for her job and asked for her licence to be endorsed with points, rather than a disqualification, so she can continue to work.Mr McAlindon said it is a \u0027horrendous offence\u0027 but stated that Ms Soakell is at \u0027low risk of reoffending\u0027.District Judge Marie Mallon said the motorcyclist was \u0027exceedingly lucky\u0027 and \u0027far worse could have arisen\u0027.She handed Ms Soakell a 20 week jail sentence, suspended for 18 months. "},{"url":null,"title":"When ministers met road groups fix shortage tanker drivers leak sparked panic Mail reveals","story":"Share this article I’m told that suspicions were heightened by the fact Duncan Buchanan, the RHA executive who was on the fateful Zoom call, made almost identical remarks during that discussion as the ‘lines’ that were briefed to ITV. Both he and Mr McKenzie, a former BBC journalist, have therefore found themselves thrown into the firing line.Grant Shapps, in an interview with Sky News last weekend, made the allegation in person: ‘There was a meeting which took place about ten days ago, a private meeting in which one of the haulage associations decided to leak the details to media,’ he said.In response to the claims, the RHA has issued a vigorous denial that McKenzie was responsible. Insiders there believe they are being scapegoated in order to shift public blame away from incompetent ministers and civil servants.‘Firstly, Rod McKenzie was not in the meeting where the BP issue was discussed,’ the RHA says. ‘Secondly, he is not the source of the leak. The first he heard of the comments was when journalists rang him asking for comment after the ITV News story had been broadcast.‘He was not, as the government source claimed, “aware of the comments” and certainly did not “weaponise” them in subsequent TV interviews. Indeed, he repeatedly stressed the need not to panic-buy and that there were adequate fuel stocks.‘It is also completely untrue to say that the “RHA leaks every meeting we have with them”. The RHA believes this disgraceful attack on a member of its staff is an attempt to ert attention away from their recent handling of the driver shortage crisis.’Buchanan has also denied responsibility for the leak.‘We have a huge degree of confidence that the RHA is to blame,’ says a senior government source. ‘Because the investigation is for now a Cabinet Office thing rather than a full public inquiry, we can’t at this stage compel them to come and give evidence, and we also can’t get the suspects to hand over their phones. But we aren’t ruling that out, so we assume they will co-operate fully.’Doubtless, they will.

Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

Photograph: Hulton ArchiveThe portrayal of Michael Collins in popular culture is “doing him a great disservice,” the Taoiseach Micheál Martin has suggested. Mr Martin, a historian before he became a politician, said the “enormous charisma and impact of Michael Collins remains undeniable”, but he was a more complex man than often portrayed. He would have rejected a presentation that put his personality before the ideas and movements he participated in. Speaking at a conference in University College Cork (UCC) on Saturday, marking the centenary of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Mr Martin said when he looked up from his desk to find portraits of both Michael Collins and Éamon de Valera staring back at him. “I can’t but reflect on the fact that neither would be comfortable with the popular view which has often neglected to tell us how long and how successfully they worked together before the final Treaty negotiations,” he said. “Neither would support the idea that the enormous contribution of the other to the success of the War of Independence was overrated. They would have understand that they both operated in the year after the Truce with forces they could not fully control.” The Civil War was not inevitable, Mr Martin suggested, and “the sheer number of times that stopped the drift to conflict was remarkable”. Mr Martin described Arthur Griffith, the leader of the Irish delegation that negotiated and signed the Anglo-Irish Treaty, as a man who was often overlooked. “He was not just a major personality at the time, he was a relentless propagandist of the cause of Irish self-determination. His contribution was vital.” Mr Martin told the conference Ireland has developed an approach to commemorating the past which shown a “shared pride and a challenging reflection on our past”. Mr Martin said he took pride in the fact that, while other countries are “reverting to an inward looking and exclusionary nationalism, we have shown respect for the complexity of the past. “In marking the centenary of the Treaty I feel there is a lot of wisdom to be found in the guidance of the expert advisory group on commemorations where the State’s task is to encourage a reflective and reconciliatory tone that recognises that neither side had a monopoly of either atrocity or virtue.” Bringing the British to the negotiating table in 1921 was a “dramatic achievement” given the disparity of strength between the biggest empire in the world at the time and the IRA which lacked the military means that other independence movements had developed, he stated. However, the independence movement had the “broad support of the majority of the people” which the British side did not have. Mr Martin said the failure to expand the franchise in the June 1922 general election to include all women was a “shameful episode that set women back many decades”. The 1922 Irish constitution envisaged that women should be able to vote on an equal basis with men, but the Provisional Government at the time pleaded that there was not time to update the electoral register. “There is simply no doubt that the Treaty debates and its aftermath saw rampant misogyny in the service of belittling and marginalising the voices of women,” Mr Martin added. “Because of their predominance on the anti-Treaty side, women were often portrayed as hysterical and unthinking with no attempt to reflect their central role in the success and legitimacy of the Irish revolution.” The Taoiseach suggested that the centrist nature of Irish politics meant that the extremes of politics in Europe in the 20th century did not happen in Ireland.

Photograph: Getty ImagesTense negotiations over the level of investment in roads projects saw talks on the National Development Plan (NDP) go down to the wire, it is understood.Government sources said significant investment in roads had been approved as part of the NDP process, which sources said had now been signed off.The €165 billion plan, to be published on Monday, will include a swathe of heavy-spending schemes which will see more than 50 projects with a price tag of more than €100 million included.Lengthy talks took place on Thursday evening between Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan over the balance between roads investment versus public transport, it is understood, before the deal was signed off.Government sources said extra road projects would be named in the NDP, and agreement had been reached during the week on infrastructure investment in both public transport and roads projects.A number of TDs and Senators made their positions clear on roads and other infrastructural investments they feel are vital – and expect Mr McGrath to deliver on next week.Clare TD Cathal Crowe, who raised the issue at the party’s parliamentary party meeting on Wednesday, said the second phase of the northern distributor road between Clare and Limerick must be funded – even in the face of Green Party concerns about building infrastructure for fossil-fuel burning vehicles.“We shouldn’t have a Green Party ideology preventing this from seeing the light of day,” he said.Mr Crowe said he told Mr McGrath “this road is positive and its non-progression leaves the region in limbo”.Mayo TD Dara Calleary, who has asked that the Western Rail Corridor as well as the second phase of the N26 and investment in broadband be included, said that investment in regional infrastructure was needed to help the regions capitalise on remote working trends. “We have to be sensible, realistic and fair, and we still do not have a proper road network in many parts of the regions, especially below national road level.”Only show in townSenator Lisa Chambers, who is also arguing for investment in the Western Rail Corridor, said investment in roads should go ahead, with technologies decarbonising the vehicles on them.“Roads are the only show in town for this particular part of the country. I think it’s premature to say we’re going to stop building roads. If the mode of transport is clean, roads aren’t the problem. The Greens’ roads argument needs to be reconsidered in the light of infrastructure deficiencies in the rest of Ireland.”Tipperary TD Jackie Cahill said it was vital that Fianna Fáil be seen to deliver projects. “It’s critical we’re seen to justify our reason for going into government and that’s to deliver for our constituencies.”"},{"url":null,"title":"philippines president duterte announces retirement from politics","story":"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte says he is backing out of an announced plan to run for vice president in next year’s elections and will retire from politics after his term ends. Photograph: Lisa Marie DavidAPPhilippine President Rodrigo Duterte has announced he is retiring from politics and dropping plans to run for vice president in next year’s elections when his term ends, avoiding a legal battle with opponents who questioned the move.He told reporters many Filipinos have expressed their opposition to his vice-presidential bid in surveys and public forums.“The overwhelming sentiment of the Filipino is that I’m not qualified, and it would be a violation of the constitution,” Mr Duterte said.“In obedience to the will of the people... I will follow what you wish and today I announce my retirement from politics.”The 76-year-old, known for his deadly anti-drugs crackdown, brash rhetoric and unorthodox political style, earlier accepted the ruling party’s nomination for him to seek the vice presidency in the May 9th elections.The decision outraged many of his opponents, who have described him as a human rights calamity in an Asian bastion of democracy.Mr Duterte announced his surprise withdrawal from the election after accompanying his former long-time aide, senator Bong Go, to register his own vice presidential candidacy with the ruling party at a Commission on Elections centre.Philippine presidents are limited by the constitution to a single six-year term and opponents had said they would question the legality of Mr Duterte’s vice presidential run before the Supreme Court if he pursued his bid.While two recent presidents ran for lower elected positions after their terms ended, Mr Duterte was the first to consider running for the vice presidency.If he had pursued the candidacy and won, that could have elevated him back to the presidency if the elected leader died or was incapacitated for any reason.Mr Duterte’s withdrawal could also pave the way for a possible presidential run by his daughter.Sara Duterte, mayor of Davao city, has been encouraged by many supporters to make a bid to succeed her father. She has topped independent public opinion surveys on who should lead the country next.But after her father declared he would seek the vice presidency, she announced she would not run for president, saying she and her father had agreed that only one Duterte would run for a national office next year.There was no immediate reaction on Saturday from Ms Duterte, who has gone on a week-long medical leave.Drugs crackdownMr Duterte took office in 2016 and immediately launched a crackdown on illegal drugs that has left more than 6,000 mostly petty suspects dead and alarmed Western governments and human rights groups.The International Criminal Court has launched an investigation into the killings but he has vowed not to co-operate with the inquiry and allow investigators to enter the country.Mr Duterte was a former long-time Davao city mayor, government prosecutor and legislator in a colourful political career that ned more than two decades.He will be remembered by many for his extra-tough approach to criminality that earned him nicknames such as “Duterte Harry”, after Clint Eastwood’s police character who had little regard for the law.When he exits from politics, he is likely to be hounded by lawsuits arising from his violent anti-criminality campaign. He cited that concern in July as one of the reasons why he accepted the ruling PDP-Laban party’s nomination for him to be its vice-presidential candidate.A top human rights group said Mr Duterte will do everything in his power to support a friendly successor and will use his lingering influence in retirement to shield himself from an array of potential criminal charges.Carlos Conde of Human Rights Watch said: “Eluding accountability for human rights abuses is Duterte’s primary concern as his presidency winds down.”–PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Inside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"case against cressida dick devastating","story":"The case for Dame Cressida Dick’s resignation was already open and shut. We really didn’t need another example of the politan Police Commissioner presiding over a culture of incompetence and cover up to know that she was in over her head, but still she provided it this week with her characteristic recalcitrance over Sarah Everard’s murder. On she ploughs, seemingly oblivious to suggestions that after arguably the most disastrous tenure Scotland Yard has ever witnessed, she should probably call it a day.Yet in refusing to step down over her force’s criminally inadequate vetting of Wayne Couzens, nicknamed “the rapist” by his police officer colleagues, Dame Cressida has not only failed his poor victim and her grieving family – but women everywhere. It pains me to say it because the significant moment in the Met’s 188-year history when Dame Cressida became its first female commissioner should have been cause for continued celebration by the sisterhood.Yet four years on from her appointment, we now find ourselves in the position of having to fight for the right to feel safe on the streets of Britain – with the woman at the helm seemingly refusing to take her fair share of the blame. So much for “leaning in”. Following revelations that Couzens sent grotesquely sexist, racist and homophobic WhatsApp messages to colleagues – and with female officers saying they were too afraid to report male officers for misconduct – we can now add “institutionalised misogyny” to the Met’s growing list of failings on Dame Cressida’s watch.The typically cloth-eared nature of her response was plain to see on Thursday, after Couzens was given a whole life tariff for his unfathomably brutal rape and murder of Miss Everard, when she once again pledged to “learn lessons” from the Met’s mistakes.What happened to the lessons that were supposed to have been learned after Dame Cressida led the team that mistakenly shot dead Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes? Or the lessons that were meant to have been learned two years ago, following the bloodiest year for homicides in London in a decade?What happened to the lessons that were supposed to be learned over Operation Midland, the Met’s bungled investigation into false allegations of historic child abuse made by the fantasist Carl Beech?Or the lessons that were meant to have been learned after the Independent Panel investigating the murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan found Dame Cressida had obstructed their inquiry into police corruption? The Oxford-educated police chief even managed to bungle the policing of Miss Everard’s vigil, while officers have rightly stood accused of pandering to the Extinction Rebellion and, more recently, Insulate Britain eco-mob.If there is any lesson to be learned here, it is that Dame Cressida has never been fit for the top job – and yet, incredibly, her contract was extended for two years in September, proving once again that failure is the best route to reward in public office.Outside the Old Bailey, again with trademark understatement, Dame Cressida declared: “I recognise that in some people a precious bond of trust has been damaged.” Sorry, “some” people? While I think the public is wise enough to appreciate that the police have a very difficult job to do, in this case they simply didn’t do it well enough. It wasn’t only Couzens who “brought shame on the Met”, as Dame Cressida put it – seemingly determined to make this about just one man. The Met has also brought shame on itself.It was an open secret that Couzens was a drug user with a taste for extreme pornography. And yet no one thought to question why he was still in possession of the warrant card he used to coax Miss Everard into his unmarked car on March 3.If it wasn’t bad enough that Couzens passed the Met vetting programme despite being investigated for indecent exposure by Kent Police in 2015, we now learn that just 72 hours before his attack on Miss Everard, he was reported for indecent exposure at a McDonald’s drive-through restaurant. Staff reported the incident to police, who identified his car from CCTV footage, but he was not arrested, leaving him free to kidnap, rape and murder.Let us be in no doubt of the facts here, amid a flurry of buck passing about “bad apples”. The police knew Couzens was rotten to his core. They had plenty of chances to stop him. Yet thanks to failures in vetting, whistle-blowing and straightforward policing, Miss Everard was killed in the most appalling way imaginable.While I appreciate that there is only one murderer here, someone has to take responsibility for the catastrophic errors that led to Couzens being able to abuse his position of authority with such utterly devastating consequences. Yet instead of assuming liability, as she should, Dame Cressida and her force are once again trying to shift the policing burden onto the public. In the vein of telling victims of theft to track down their own stolen cars, we are now being told that if we do find ourselves “in an interaction with a sole police officer”, we should “seek further reassurance of that officer’s identity and intentions.”As well as asking for “independent verification” such as hearing the voice of an operator on a radio, the latest guidance from the Met is that people who get stopped should ask “where are your colleagues, where have you come from, why are you here and exactly why are you stopping or talking to me?”I’m not sure that’s quite what London Mayor Sadiq Khan meant when he said “serious questions needed to be answered”. Surely the only question the public really needs an answer to is: are there any more rapists and murderers in the police? Funnily enough, women placed under arrest would rather be able to trust the officer in charge, than have to feel the need to “wave down a bus”, “run into a house” or “shout out to a passer-by” to check that he isn’t actually a psychopath. Moreover, rather than publishing yet another “strategy for tackling violence against women and girls”, mightn’t it be an idea for the Met to get its own house in order?Such was the culture of silence around Couzens’s vile behaviour that despite giving female officers “the creeps”, none of the women made a formal complaint against him because of the male-dominated nature of the force. In general, female officers said they were afraid to report their male colleagues for misconduct due to fears they would be abandoned on calls or have their “heads kicked in”. Meanwhile, nothing was made of the fact that Couzens – then a serving officer with the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, having transferred from Kent Police – had repeatedly exposed himself while driving. Even when he was spotted driving to Dover naked from the waist down in 2015, for reasons that remain unclear, the CNC was not informed while Kent Police marked the investigation as “no further action”. And people wonder why the victims of sexual crimes don’t think they are going to be taken seriously by the police? In this case, the police didn’t even take seriously the nefarious behaviour of one of their own.Dame Cressida has rightly said that the Met is “full of people who are good, who work all their lives to protect others”. I know the vast majority of decent, committed police officers are as appalled by what Couzens has done as the rest of us. They deserve better – and so does the public.When the trust has gone, the leadership must go with it.More from NewsApple\u0026#39s encrypted browsing will make it harder for police to investigate dangerous criminalsRoyal Navy recruitment drive in 1960s targeted \u0026#39public and grammar school sixth-formers\u0026#39Queen recalls \u0026#39happy memories\u0026#39 with Prince Philip in Scotland in first remarks since his deathSplit in major cocaine trafficking ring triggers string of beheadingsDrivers risk being \u0026#39fleeced\u0026#39 by 5p per litre petrol price increase amid fuel crisisBicycle theft soared in one of London\u0026#39s experimental green road zonesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"voters can smell starmers insincerity james bond mile","story":"Asked by a reporter who his favourite James Bond was, Labour leader Keir Starmer refused to answer. “I don\u0027t have a favourite Bond, but I do think it\u0027s time for a female Bond.”This is not a column about the fashionable idiocy of demanding that female actors be cast in established male roles in order that, in some mysterious and unspecified way, sex equality is more quickly achieved. Rather, it is a lesson in that most valuable and rarest of political qualities: authenticity.Most people in this country have a favourite Bond. It is reasonable to expect our politicians to have an opinion on the matter just it would be reasonable to ask them about their favourite football team (a topic on which Starmer himself is far more forthcoming). Since football is at least as trivial a topic as that of James Bond, is it really credible to believe that this man of the people doesn’t have a view as to whether Roger Moore was a better choice to play 007 than Timothy Dalton or Sean Connery?Even that doesn’t matter. Starmer may well be one of the dozen or so people in the country who’s never seen a Bond film and genuinely has no opinion on it. Fair enough. Weird, but fair enough. So why would someone with so little interest in a movie franchise feel so strongly about the need to change the main, iconic character’s sex? Either you don’t care about the character or you care so much about it that you want to demolish nearly 60 years of established character building. Starmer, perhaps unsurprisingly for a modern politician, wants it both ways. This is unwise.When John Smith was leader of the Labour Party, he (perhaps ill advisedly) agreed to appear on BBC Radio 1 to be interviewed, during which event he was asked – and failed to answer – a question about who was at number 1 that week. No one cared because no one thought it was particularly important that a future prime minister (as he was generally considered to be at the time) kept up to speed with the music played by popular beat combos on the wireless and their success in the Hit Parade.But Starmer cannot now claim to have weightier subjects on his mind than the best actor to have played Bond because he followed up his first answer (“I don’t have a favourite”) with a plea for someone of unspecified name but specific sex to play the role in future.This clumsy, cynical attempt to virtue signal what for most people would be an interesting pub conversation (and let it now be observed that Keir Starmer is incapable of carrying on a light-hearted conversation over a pint) is perhaps more relevant than you might at first think. Did Starmer expect the question? I suspect not, given how rubbish his answer was. If it was prepared in advance, that would be even worse.Did he and his advisers reckon the question was a trap? If he answered “Sean Connery”, would he then find himself in a Twitter row about the late Scottish actor’s deplorable record of violence against women? Would Sir Roger or Pierce Brosnan be safer responses? Where the hell is that briefing on George Lazenby?The sheer awfulness of his answer, the utter lack of authenticity that led him to turn a jolly, interesting question into a political point with which vanishingly few people would agree, is informative. Worse, it threatens to remind voters of that epitome of the inauthentic politician, Ed Miliband.Remember when Miliband sacked Emily Thornberry from his front bench after she had Tweeted a snobby photo of a house bedecked with England flags and a white van in the driveway? Remember how the then Labour leader responded when asked in a TV interview what he thought when he saw a white van? And remember the extent to which the nation’s toes curled like the wicked witch’s after Dorothy’s house landed on her?“I think, respect,” said Ed, to the muffled and perplexed howls of embarrassed laughter of the nation.Respect? Why on earth would you see any particular vehicle on the road and think, “Respect”? It was an answer a million miles away from the reality of every other citizen’s life. I would hazard a guess that the rest of us, when we see a white van, think, “Oh, a white van. I’d better get out of its path before it flattens me.”Voters can tell when a politician is seeking to suck up to them, especially when they try to do so by using blatantly cynical language that’s been shaped by the last focus group results. They can tell when someone says something authentic, and when it falls short of that standard – as both Miliband and Starmer’s comments did – they make their own judgment.Starmer’s answer sounded calculated and insincere. If he was worried that giving any answer would alienate the fans of the other five actors who have played Bond, maybe he needs to get a bit of perspective on the subjects that actually shift people’s votes, because movie casting decisions isn’t one of them.And so what if some people disagreed with him? Here we have a politician who said this week that he prioritises winning a general election over his own party’s unity and yet he’s worried about a backlash from Daniel Craig fans? Really?Keir Starmer needs to start behaving and sounding like one of the ordinary voters whose support he desperately needs. Those voters will be going in their droves to watch “No Time To Die” in the next few weeks. Many – perhaps even most of them – will have a view on who the best Bond was and they won’t worry about who is offended by their opinion because no one will be.And in case you’re wondering, the correct answer would have been Connery.More from NewsApple\u0026#39s encrypted browsing will make it harder for police to investigate dangerous criminalsRoyal Navy recruitment drive in 1960s targeted \u0026#39public and grammar school sixth-formers\u0026#39Queen recalls \u0026#39happy memories\u0026#39 with Prince Philip in Scotland in first remarks since his deathSplit in major cocaine trafficking ring triggers string of beheadingsDrivers risk being \u0026#39fleeced\u0026#39 by 5p per litre petrol price increase amid fuel crisisBicycle theft soared in one of London\u0026#39s experimental green road zonesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lefts becoming cult losing followers","story":"A timely study has found that on the Left, authoritarianism is as much a problem as on the Right. The researchers themselves were surprised - since the 1950s the far Right were inextricably linked to such phenomena. But something since has changed: the traits the researchers identified on the Left will make you wince in recognition: “social uniformity”, “cognitive rigidity” “moral absolutism”, and “willingness to wield group authority to coerce behaviour”. The Labour conference was evidence of this as much as anything else. Take the personality cult remaining around Corbyn, who somehow still dominates the fringes after his demise à la Lenin (Dianne Abbott said it best earlier this week: “Jeremy is always right”). Or indeed, the repudiation of anyone who doesn’t align with Labour’s enlightened knowledge of what is best for The People: 45 per cent of voters at the last estimate voted for a party that is, according to Angela Rayner “homophobic, racist, misogynistic” (and “vile”, in case you were wondering). Those “never f*** a Tory” insignia the young so proudly bear reek of Lebensborn - procreate only with your own. Most awkwardly, in my early twenties I used to think along these lines: I just assumed that if you voted Tory, you had deep-down dishonourable instincts. It sounds risible but is perhaps unsurprising - I didn’t know anyone right-wing, and everyone I did know suggested the Conservative desire to pull yourself up by your bootstraps was a smokescreen for an aversion to the poor and ethnic minorities (a few friends still seem to think as such). I recently came to the troubling realisation my fundamental thinking was redolent of the cultish interpretation of Hinduism I witnessed during parts of my childhood: The unquestioning comfort in a single source of truth, the judgement on others and their materialistic, earthly pleasures as sinful, dirty - as Rayner said Tories are “scum” (and as Trotsky said: “We can only be right with and by the party”): There is no room for nuance away from the dogma handed from on high. Indeed, it is telling that many women who have experienced real, boot-quaking authoritarianism - are fleeing the Left: Katy Morgan-Davies, famously held captive by her abusive father’s Maoist cult for the first thirty years of her life, has quit the Labour party because: “I hear things that remind me very much of the cult, some of the language, the hating on white people or on men. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, once a member of the Muslim Brotherhood said the censoriousness of the Left reminded her of extreme Islamists: “because if you disagree with them, you’re cancelled, you’re out, you’re punished”.How strange that this belief system which prides itself on standing up for the marginalised is dismissive of women who voice unease, makes Rosie Duffield fear for her life - just like every other misogynistic, authoritarian regime we’ve ever been presented with.It is counterproductive because, in my experience, it’s only by giving your beliefs a shake-out, and seeing what still sticks, that you find out what you truly believe in. So many of the Left are defeating themselves: when questioned they reply with the kind of circular justifications I’ve seen only among the ultra-religious and 1984. So-called “liberals” once understood that flexing, moulding and interrogating the way we do things is what has helped society to stamp out isms from sexism to racism - now many are the same inflexible they accused the Right of being. The adage the Left seeks traitors while the Right seeks converts” has never been truer - who wants to enter the fray, only to be excommunicated at the next purge?Perhaps the most headache-worthy aspect of the study is that it took the authors by surprise - the psychologists themselves admitted there was “scant” evidence for the existence of left-wing authoritarianism. But is this surprising, given the way the likes of Nigel Biggar have left professorships, how scientists clubbed together in Lancet op-eds and the like to silence anyone such as Angus Dagleish, who suggested that Covid-19 might have originated in a lab? Left-wing beliefs are ubiquitous among universities and sociologists the research establishment. And it indicates the exact irony of the situation authoritarianism among much of the Left creates complacency about authoritarianism on the Left: One of the things about echo chambers is you can’t see where the walls end.More from NewsApple\u0026#39s encrypted browsing will make it harder for police to investigate dangerous criminalsRoyal Navy recruitment drive in 1960s targeted \u0026#39public and grammar school sixth-formers\u0026#39Queen recalls \u0026#39happy memories\u0026#39 with Prince Philip in Scotland in first remarks since his deathSplit in major cocaine trafficking ring triggers string of beheadingsDrivers risk being \u0026#39fleeced\u0026#39 by 5p per litre petrol price increase amid fuel crisisBicycle theft soared in one of London\u0026#39s experimental green road zonesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"prime minister must remember conservative principles","story":"Taxes are at their highest level for decades, so Oliver Dowden’s words to this newspaper are welcome: the Tories have always kept taxes low and sought to cut them, he says, and that’s where the Prime Minister and Chancellor’s hearts lie, too.Readers will be wondering: if the present Conservative Government is keen on low taxes, when might we expect them to start coming down? We are picking up the tab for lockdown at some point, there needs to be a strategy for creating more wealth. The Tories have traditionally backed lower taxes for moral reasons but also because they pay for themselves.

From Tunbridge Wells to Hartlepool, voters seek reassurance that crime is being tackled, the borders brought under control, the woke will have their wings clipped and the direction of economic policy will be towards greater freedom, not state control.There is a misunderstanding among some Tories that holding on to the Red Wall necessitates embracing the nanny state and that the Government’s popularity under lockdown is an endorsement of greater bureaucracy.

We’re at a point where we have to restore the liberties and freedoms that were lost for almost two years now. This is a more suitable technology for that.”The way the test works is by identifying whether or not the virus is active, in a similar way to how a flower bud can appear opened or closed. If the spike in the virus is active, the bud would be open as it would use this to enter human cells. If it is closed, then this would mean the virus is inactive, and the person would not be infectious.People would need to just swab the test in their mouth, rather than needing to take a sample from their throat or nose, and would receive a result in 15 minutes.Vatic’s tests have, so far, produced no false positives in its clinical trials involving around 1,000 people.The company has this week partnered with Abingdon Health, the London-listed test-maker, which previously built fertility tracking tests and developed Covid antibody tests. Abingdon will be making the tests for Vatic under a deal which initially will see it making as many as two million tests a month, but could increase to 100 million tests every year.The tests are not yet on sale to the public, although Vatic has registered the tests with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for professional use. It is attempting to get approval for the tests to be used at home, and is also in talks with the Government over how they could form part of UK testing efforts going into the winter.Sheppard said as the virus mutates and tries to become more infectious, it is becoming easier for the test to be able to tell whether people are infectious or not. He said the tests had been built to be future-proof to mutations.“All of the other antigen tests which are out there, it’s not a question of if but when they’ll stop working. Eventually the tests will need to be redesigned because the virus will have mutated. “Our test will always be able to detect the virus insofar as it will enter human cells through the same mechanism, and that wouldn’t change because if it did, it would be a new virus altogether.”Ministers have said they are keen for Britain to start making its own Covid-19 tests, rather than importing them from China.In February, the Government announced it was striking a deal worth up to £374m with Scottish company Omega to start making lateral flow tests in Britain.However, it has yet to decide which Covid-19 tests it wants to be produced.More from NewsApple\u0026#39s encrypted browsing will make it harder for police to investigate dangerous criminalsRoyal Navy recruitment drive in 1960s targeted \u0026#39public and grammar school sixth-formers\u0026#39Queen recalls \u0026#39happy memories\u0026#39 with Prince Philip in Scotland in first remarks since his deathSplit in major cocaine trafficking ring triggers string of beheadingsDrivers risk being \u0026#39fleeced\u0026#39 by 5p per litre petrol price increase amid fuel crisisBicycle theft soared in one of London\u0026#39s experimental green road zonesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"army start delivering fuel monday","story":":root Desperate bid to end petrol crisis with Army delivering fuel from MondayMinisters have triggered Operation Escalin, with  military personnel to fill \"critical vacancies\" and get petrol to the pumpsThe fuel crisis has now been going on for a week, Image: PAByRachel Wearmouth:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsSoldiers will start delivering petrol to forecourts from Monday as ministers scramble to end the fuel crisis gripping Britain.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, said: “Across the weekend over  military personnel will have been mobilised as part of Operation Escalin. “While the situation is stabilising, our Armed Forces are there to fill in any critical vacancies and help keep the country on the move by supporting the industry to deliver fuel to forecourts.”  Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey, said Labour would backed calling in the military as he blamed the Government for the crisis. We know the Army will step up and deliver when asked, but this is a sticking plaster, he said. We need a proper plan to recruit and train more drivers, including improvements to terms and conditions for those working in the sector. The Mirror also revealed earlier today that thousands of firefighters have been sent letters from the Government urging them to take up HGV driving. The Government already faced fury for sending letters to ambulance paramedics, offering fantastic opportunities, attractive pay rates and flexible hours to help solve the shortages. The visa scheme announced last week by Government allows for , drivers and bends immigration rules in recognition of the extraordinary set of circumstances affecting the stability of the UK supply chain.

He said: “The Prime Minister should be taking emergency action today but yet again he’s failed to grasp the seriousness of the crisis. If it needs legislation, then let’s recall Parliament to get these emergency measures through urgently. “The Prime Minister promised to save Christmas last year and we all know that went disastrously wrong. Now he’s making the same empty promises again. Boris Johnson was warned about this crisis and he did nothing about it. He had the chance to make a plan but ignored it. The Prime Minister needs to get a grip.” The Petrol Retailers Associationsaid that independent stations, which total % of the network were not receiving enough deliveries of fuel. More than a quarter of the PRAaposs membersapos filling stations were still empty on Friday and less than half had both petrol and diesel in stock, said Executive Director Gordon Balmer.  Whilst the situation is similar to recent days, there are signs that it is improving, but far too slowly, he said. Until independents start getting frequent supplies, we will continue to see long queues at forecourts. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng insisted that the fuel crisis was subsiding, however. He said: Thanks to the immense efforts of industry over the past week, we are seeing continued signs that the situation at the pumps is slowly improving. UK forecourt stock levels are trending up, deliveries of fuel to forecourts are above normal levels, and fuel demand is stabilising. “It’s important to stress there is no national shortage of fuel in the UK, and people should continue to buy fuel as normal.

The regulator said it was “in relation to potential unregistered consultant lobbying”, and the paper said an inquiry began around August .It comes after claims earlier earlier this year that the ex-Conseravtive leader, who quit Downing Street in July  following the Brexit referendum, lobbied the then Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi and the then Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, on behalf of US biotech firm Illumina.Mr Cameron has worked as a paid adviser for Illumnia since . Open Democracy reported in July that the ex-PM met Mr Zahawi less than two months before Illumina won £, of contracts over genome sequencing from Public Health England.  In August, the Times reported that in April  Mr Cameron lobbied Mr Hancock regarding a multimillion pound contract with a company owned by the Department of Health. Under rules drawn-up in , when Mr Cameron was in No, people and organisations that lobby ministers or permanent secretaries on behalf of clients are required to register with the regulator.

In the aftermath of the scandal, he said: “As a former Prime Minister, I accept that communications with government need to be done through only the most formal of channels.”  A Department of Health spokesman told the FT the  contract was a follow-on deal to an  sequencing contract with Illumina. “[It] was awarded in the correct way, through the proper process and any suggestion of undue ministerial involvement in the decision making is completely wrong,” the ministry added.

Qudratullah Rajavi, , and we Rana Yazdanpanah, , had been making videos showing their le as a modern, liberal couple in Afghanistan for years before the terror group took over. Along with their daughter Katayoun, who is just under six months old, the couple were forced to flee for their lives. Qudrat was born in Iran as a refugee of the Afghan civil war in the s, with his family moving back to Afghanistan when he was a teenager. He found work as a translator with Afghan and international NGOs as well as freelance filmmaking work.  Rana had also been a refugee in Iran before coming to Afghanistan at around . She’d recently been working as an administration manager with the presidential office, but had also done modelling and acting work. As recently as last year, Rana had made national news for unashamedly cycling despite constant threats and harassment that female cyclists face. Qudrat says: “We rode bikes together in the streets of Kabul in an attempt to promote respect for women. It’s not common at all for women to bike in Afghanistan.” But it was their YouTube channel, setup in , that would create the most danger when Kabul fell in August. The couple’s sweet videos could have been made by any young couple in Britain – hiking together, baking bread, playing pranks. Qudrat says: “We wanted to show the world that a couple in Afghanistan can also live a happy le like many other couples around the world. “When we saw some popular YouTube couples, we were inspired by their actions and thought we could also do this and show another aspect of Afghanistan. “We showed that people here are also human beings and they have a normal le.” While their videos racked up thousands of views and lots of encouraging comments, not everyone supported what they were doing. Some Afghans from particularly conservative provinces especially objected to Rana’s involvement. Qudrat explains: “It’s not culturally appropriate for women to show themselves in videos and smile and laugh doing fun stuff. “To them, it was somehow weird and abnormal.” Qudrat says the majority of feedback they received on their first video were disapproving. Some took their disapproval even further than comments. “A fake Facebook page was created in our name publishing inappropriate stuff with swearing and offensive words,” Qudrat says.“It humiliated us and said very bad things in an attempt to discourage us from continuing what we do. “It bothered us a lot – but we didn’t give up.” The risk they were taking with their channel was clear even in the content of their videos. In one vlog last summer, in which they take a road trip from Kabul to Daykundi, Qudrat’s cheerily delivered voiceover says: “We are getting closer and closer to Jalrez district, an unsafe area in which Taliban have their own checkpoints – we will not film this area so we can survive.” That video ends teasing a future video which would be a lighthearted look at what traditional village le is like in Afghanistan. But that upload never arrived – instead, after a year of no new content, the first new footage on the channel came in August of this year. It shows Rana alone, in tears, in a clip titled: “My heart aches on the last day before the fall of Kabul”.  Qudrat says: “Rana, in that video, she cries and is frightened because that night, the Taliban captured Kabul. “We were in our homes and didn’t go anywhere because of the danger. “She said: ‘I want to share my feelings in a YouTube video.’” But it was these appearances in publicly available media that put them both at risk. Within days of the fall of Kabul, Qudrat and Rana realised they had to flee. “Sooner or later, the Taliban would start their revenge,” Qudrat says. Reports soon began of Taliban fighters going door to door and executing people they considered enemies. As Hazaras – an ethnic group persecuted by the Taliban – who had publicly lived at odds with the terror group’s warped morality, Qudrat and Rana were in grave danger. “We heard from our relatives that some Taliban members came to our neighbourhoods asking for people who have worked in the military, in the government,” Qudrat says. “Fortunately, the neighbours didn’t know about us – and also we were not there, and that helped us to be safe.” Deciding to leave was necessary for their safety, but it was a heartbreaking decision to take.  Qudrat says: “We lived a happy le and we wanted to stay in Afghanistan. “We were hopeful that we could make progress there because it was our own country, and we were our own boss. “But after the Taliban’s capture of major provinces and Kabul, my we and I saw no future for ourselves or Afghanistan.” Deciding to leave was one thing, but actually getting out was another altogether. Qudrat worked day and night filling in forms and emailing dferent authorities in a bid to get onto an evacuation list. Within days of  August, when US troops were withdrawn from the country, Qudrat, Rana and their baby managed to get onto a list. But the airport was in chaos when they arrived and they couldn’t get in. The family decided to go home – about  minutes before an IS-K suicide bomber detonated a bomb killing at least  people.  Qudrat says: “We were at the Abbey Gate where the suicide attack happened. “We showed our documents to the soldiers but they didn’t pay attention – they only allowed foreign passport holders in. “The explosion was exactly at the sewer where we stood.” They decided it was too dangerous toto the airport after the massacre, and the evacuation deadline passed. They’d lost all hope – when a few days later, they were instructed to travel to another province where there was hope they could be put on a flight after the deadline. Brit journalist Nadene Ghouri, who has been working with an international coalition of volunteers to help at-risk Afghans get to safety, saw the YouTube couple publicly calling for help, and decided she needed to support them. “Rana and Qudrat were the young modern generation of Afghanistan,” Nadene says. “All they were trying to do was show the world the nice side of their country. “Itaposs hard to believe that something as normal as a man kissing his we publicly or baking bread in the pandemic with her is seen as shameful or punishable by the Taliban. “But itaposs the Taliban not Rana and Qudrat who need to be ashamed.” Qudrat and Rana had to move constantly out of safety concerns for nearly three weeks. Sometimes they even had to sleep outside while waiting for news that they would actually be evacuated. Qudrat says: “It was cold and windy at night and everyone got sick, and our baby also got sick and cold. “It was very dficult.” When the news finally came that they would be on a flight, the family were so desperate not to miss their chance that they slept outside by the buses that would take them to the airport in the morning. The night air was still, which allowed mosquitoes to bother the children as they slept. Qudrat says: “The children were all bitten by mosquitoes, their faces were red. “There were lots of rashes.” In the morning they were flown to Qatar and taken to As Sayliyah, a former US Army Base, where the family remain as refugees. Thankfully baby Katayoun is doing well and “smiles a lot”, with the family being comfortable. Although they’re now safe themselves, Qudrat and Rana are still fearful for their loved ones still in Afghanistan. Some have studied or worked in places that put them at risk of reprisal from the Taliban. But Qudrat also fears about them being caught up in a brewing “humanitarian crisis” engulfing the country. “People are unemployed and banks don’t have money,” he says. A tragedy is going to happen there.” For now, Qudrat and Rana face an uncertain future of their own, but they are hopeful they will be moved to the US to begin a new le there. They’d ideally like to go to Los Angeles. Qudrat says: “I want to start a career there in multimedia productions,it’s possible.“Rana wants to become an actress – she wants to be featured in movies with Angelina Jolie because she loves her a lot, especially in Maleficent.”Although they had to close their YouTube channel down when they were hiding from the Taliban, it’s now back online. And they hope to continue making videos when they can.“I have heard that le in the US is pretty dficult,” Qudrat says.“You have to be tough, you have to work hard, becauseyou don’t work hard you’re going to be hungry or homeless.“So we will do our jobs there, but in our leisure time and at the weekends we will for sure produce videos on YouTube.”Do you have a story to share  Email webfeatures@trinitymirror.Comment MORE ON YouTubeTalibanSoldiersCivil warIran\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Paul Ashmore, a Liverpool local, died on September  after suffering from complications relating to his cancer treatment. The -year-old was suffering from Central Nervous System lymphoma, a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma at the time of his death. He had a long medical history and had previously been diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma but later went into remission.Justine told theLiverpool Echothat the pair had been together for  years, having met when she had just started university.He was the le and soul of the party. As soon as he walked into the room you knew he was there,” she said. I remember when I first met him I was like aposwho is this guy apos - he was just so bubbly and chatty. He was so warm and friendly with everyone he met. Everyone said he was the nicest guy who always wanted to do the best for people. He was literally my soulmate and I canapost believe heaposs gone. In early , Paul had been diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma but after a course of chemotherapy was back to full health. Justine, who found out she was pregnant with her second daughter Naomi during the start of the pandemic last year, said in some way the last -months turned out to be a blessing. She said: We had a lovely year really as we were both working from home. We got to spend quality time together and Claudia was at home. Lockdown had its blessings because we just got to spend so much time together as a family and Iaposll always cherish that. A headache that was so bad it forced him out of a meeting at work in July, this year, turned out to be a brain tumour, with Paul being diagnosed with cancer for the second time in his le. In August, Paul started an intensive course of chemotherapy to treat his central nervous system lymphoma. Justine said the diagnosis was “devastating”. “But again, because he had been through so much we thought okay, this is terrible but thereaposs a treatment plan and weaposll get through this,” she said.  It had gone well but then he developed neutropenic sepsis, which is one of the complications of the treatment as it was such an extreme chemotherapy.Paul was rushed to hospital on September  and died on Sunday, September . A fundraising page has been set up by friends in memory of Paul to help his family at this devastating time. Speaking of his passing, Justine said she “never dreamed” he wouldn’t make it through. “I think also he used to hide how bad he was feeling, he was always so brave and strong. We didnapost think anything would ever get him,” she said. I donapost feel like Iaposve fully processed it yet. I canapost really cope with whataposs happened. Iaposve got so much support around me - my family and friends have been amazing. Claudia is very upset but she seems to be coping well. She talks about him all the time. When she finds a feather on the floor she says, aposThataposs from Daddyapos. Her youngest, Naomi, also recognised her ‘da da’ when the family were looking at photos, Justine said. “I donapost want her to forget him,” she said. He was to me the greatest husband I could have wished for.

It was all decided around me. She was upset that the timing didn’t work for the baby’s schedule and so he was unsettled during the ceremony. Compared to the huge ceremonies we expect of royal weddings, funerals and coronations, christenings might seem rather simple affairs. But they can end up being just as tense as great affairs of state.There has been mounting speculation about the christening of Lilibet, second child of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who born in July. We have been given ious accounts from sources: that the event might be held at Windsor, that it might not that the Queen might or might not come that other royals might be offended or they might not.We don’t knowthere are any firm plans – the christening of Eugenie’s son, August, had to be postponed due to a Covid case, as so many ceremonies have been delayed over the last  months. No spokesperson has made a statement. But still the speculation continues. The last royal christening was for Archie, the Duke and Duchess of Sussexaposs first child, in  by the Archbishop of Canterbury in Windsor. The christening generated a blizzard of criticism, that ‘we’ the public deserved to see pictures of the royals entering the chapel and know the identity of the godparents – and much of this said to be because the public had paid £. million for the renovation of Frogmore Cottage.  It was, for me, the peak of the Sussexes being attacked for what all other royals did without attracting any comment - in this case living in a house owned by the Crown, renovated with Crown money. Less than six months later, the Sussexes stepped down from the Royal Family. As they later pointed out,Archie was not to have a royal title, then why should they reveal as many details about his christening as those with titles Archie wore the traditional christening robe of honiton lace. Queen Victoria made the original for her own first-born, Princess Victoria, after the style and material of her own wedding dress. Victoria’s gown had been considered surprising, even shocking - white was seen as unfitting, more like a nightgown.The formal robe was worn by another  royal babies at christenings, including William and Harry, before a replica was made for the next generation. Presumably Victoria wished for a calmer christening for her daughter than her own had been. At hers, in , her father - convinced she would come to the throne despite him being fourth in line - wished her to have a traditional royal name. But his brother, the future George IV, was angry at his brother’s ambition and refused to give the child a regal moniker. Her first name was agreed to be Alexandrina, after the Russian Tsar, but that couldn’t be her given name. No one knew what the child would be called until the very last minute – when the Prince Regent shrugged and decreed that she would be named Victoria, after her mother Victoire – a name that to the English seemed preposterous.  The Queen later said: I was the first person ever to be called Victoria. Six generations later, Diana felt sidelined by the ritual of a day in which everything was out of control. Hopefully, as we move forward, christenings can be less fraught - and Harry and Meghan can choose what they would like for their child.

Theyaposre also calling for clarity about why there are so many more deaths in northern regions. Among them was Hannah Brady, daughter of Shaun, a factory worker from Wigan, Greater Manchester, and granddaughter of Margaret Brady, who died in a care home while her son was in intensive care. “I said to the prime minister, ‘I believe you were  when you caught Covid and were in intensive care – my dad Shaun was  when he caught Covid and died’,” said Hannah. “I told him how dad passed away, and the things I think contributed to that, and the mistakes still happening today. I told him: ‘This is how badly you messed up’. It could take another year before the Covid- pandemic is completely finished, according to the head of vaccine producer Moderna. The company’s chief executive, Stéphane Bancel, said a boost in vaccine production should mean enough jabs for “everyone on this Earth” by the middle of next year. He said booster shots would be available soon, as would jabs for infants. With the vaccine industry as a whole expanding production, “enough doses should be available by the middle of next year so that everyone on this Earth can be vaccinated”, he said. Mr Bancel added: “Those who do not get vaccinated will immunise themselves naturally, because the Delta iant is so contagious.

Andrew Price shot through Haydock at nearly mph in mph and mph zones while reportedly swigging alcohol at the wheel. The -year-old lost control of his black Lexus IS and careered into four parked vehicles, before smashing into two front gardens at around mph. Backseat passenger Adam Edwards, , died from a cardiac arrest brought on by catastrophic internal injuries in an ambulance on the way to hospital, while front seat passenger, Anthony Finch, , was left in a coma and suffered brain damage. Members of the victimsapos families gasped when this clip of Priceaposs driving in the moments before the crash was played at Liverpool Crown Court.  Merseyside Police has now released the footage with the permission of Adamaposs family, who slammed Price for the selfish choices he made that proved fatal. Price, of Southworth Road, Newton-le-Willows, had already run a red light on the wrong side of Crow Lane, forcing an oncoming car to swerve to avoid a collision, as rain lashed down at around .pm, on Wednesday, December , . Judge Stuart Driver, QC, told Price: You then drove down Vista Road at shocking, deadly speeds for almost a mile. Price overtook two cars by driving in the wrong lane and on the wrong side of keep left bollards, as he averaged speeds of between mph to mph in mph and mph areas. Geoffrey Lowe, prosecuting, said Price then had to move back into the correct lane to avoid a parked single decker bus and an oncoming car on the residential street. The CCTV clips shows Price passing the bus at breathtaking speed, before Mr Lowe said the Lexus very quickly goes out of view, having produced a lot of spray from the wet road.  Mr Lowe said witness Adam Naggy later observed he has never seen any vehicle travel as fast along Vista Road in his le. Having passed the bus, and with no other cars present in the road, Price lost control, moved to the right side of the road, mounted the pavement and hit four vehicles, then ended up in two front gardens. Mr Edwards was conscious after the crash, but had sustained internal injuries including a broken pelvis and left leg, with extensive bleeding. Rear seat passenger Matthew Williamson got out of the car, only to collapse with injuries to his knee and pelvis, which required surgery. Local resident Jessica Bailey, who had first aid training, helped the victims and dragged Price out when he fell unconscious. She spoke to Mr Edwards and tended to Mr Finch before giving CPR to Price, who had suffered a cardiac arrest.  The court heard Price aposdiedapos for  minutes at the scene, but was brought back to le with CPR and defibrillation shocks. He was taken to hospital and put in a coma, having suffered a bleed on the brain, before he was discharged on December , . Mr Finch, who was unconscious and trapped, was rescued by firefighters before he was taken to hospital and put in a coma. He had suffered a brain injury and spent three months in hospital, before he was discharged in February . Mr Lowe said he had a long list of injuries including broken ribs, a broken pelvis, punctured lungs and a ruptured pancreas. The prosecutor said the worst of these was the bleed on his brain, leading to brain damage, and his face is scarred from where it hit the windscreen. Mr Lowe said: He said that the injuries have changed his le forever. The court heard Mr Finch cannot work, has memory loss and believes his le has been ruined by this.  Priceaposs blood was taken three hours after the crash and found to show alcohol, cannabis and cocaine, below the legal limits. However, a back calculation showed at the time of the crash he most likely had around mg of alcohol in ml of blood. The legal limit is mg. Police analysed CCTV to calculate the speed of the Lexus and an airbag control module on the car revealed he only braked a second before impact.Price, whose lawyer said he had absolute remorse for his actions and would eternally feel regretful, admitted causing death and serious injury by dangerous driving.The court heard he had previously been convicted of drug driving and banned from the road for  months in .Judge Driver said: You chose deliberately to drive very dangerously for no reason other than your own pleasure. Price was jailed for nine years and disqualied from driving for nine and a half years. Speaking after the case, Inspector Stuart McIver, of Merseyside Police Roads Policing Unit, said: This was a devastating crash, caused by Priceaposs recklessness and disregard for the safety of himself and others in the car that night. That a young man lost his le is the absolutely tragic but avoidable consequence of the decisions Price made in driving at high speed in a residential area. “We continue to support Adamaposs family and pass on our sincere condolences for their loss. Perhaps todayaposs sentencing will provide some comfort after almost two years has passed. I also hope that the effect it has had on Adamaposs family and friends and the wider community shows what can and does happen when vehicles are driven dangerously on our roads. Adamaposs family have shown dignity and courage throughout this process and their words below should make others think twice about taking to our roads in the manner Price did that night.

This means that she will happily eat strawberries during the summer, but would refuse them in winter in case they are not organic. He shared that the Queen does not want to eat genetically modied foods, much like her son, Prince Charles, who is also an organic foods enthusiast. Mr McGrady had said: “You can send strawberries every day to the Queen during summer at Balmoral and she’ll never say a word. “Try including strawberries on the menu in January and she’ll scrub out the line and say don’t dare send me genetically modied strawberries.”  The Queen does not tell anyone what her favourite food is The Queen has a favourite food, but she prefers to keep it a secret for a very good reason. A royal insider has explained how the Queen does not share her favourite dish in order to avoid being served the same thing at every Royal visit. Gordon Rayner, a former royal correspondent for Thehas previously shared that he found out this fact from a royal member of staff. He said: As one of her staff told me, ‘If she said she had a favourite meal she would never get served anything .’  The Queen always has afternoon tea, regardless of where she is McGrady has previously told Hello! Magazine that no matter which where in the world she is, Her Majesty is always served afternoon in accordance with her strict diet plan. The time that she has afternoon tea may change however depending on time zones. McGrady said: “She’d always have afternoon tea wherever she was in the world. “We’d flown out to Australia and were on the Royal Yacht. “It was five o’clock in the morning but for the Queen it was five in the afternoon so my first job was making scones.” The Queen enjoys scones with cream and jam with an Earl Grey tea and an assortment of dferent types of cake.  The Royal Family are more relaxed than you might think McGrady has previously said that during summer holidays in Balmoral, the Royals like to take a more laid back approach to dining. They would often have barbecues with the late Prince Phillip cooking food on the grill for them to enjoy, according to the Express. On holidays, they would also spend time fishing and picking berries that they would later enjoy at dinner. McGrady even claimed that the Queen has washed up after a barbecue, and that she eats fruit out of tupperware.

Kate Middleton will have an important role in the future of the monarchy and her ability to connect with the public has been noted. Since she has produced three future heirs to the throne the Duchess has already fulfilled her most important role, in royal eyes, since she married second in line Prince William. Royal expert Katie Nicholl has emphasised the important role Kate will have going forward. During the ITV documentary, Kate: The Making of a Modern Queen, Ms Nicholl said Kate was taking steps to become Queen.  Ms Nicholl added the palace machine was aware of Kateaposs ability to move the monarchy forward with Prince William as Queen consort. Ms Nicholl said: There are two roles to a future Queen. One is to produce heirs, which she has done and one is to learn to one day become Queen.  That is very much what we are seeing, we are seeing a Queen in waiting. We are seeing the Duchess take on more duties, more royal engagements, more of a public profile than ever before. She is taking on patronages from the Queen and from the Duke of Edinburgh. The Royal expert said there seemed to be an overall plan for Kate and her status within the family.  She said: This is all very deliberate and a part of the palace machine bringing her from the shadows of Anmer into the spotlight. This is because they are very clever and realise the power of Kate. They realise the potential of Prince William and Kate as this young, glamorous, dynamic duo. A duo who actually have the ability to reshape and project the monarchy into the future.  Prince William and Kate married at Westminster Abbey on April ,  and the pair have gradually taken on more responsibilities to support the Queen. Just this week Kate oozed glamour as she joined William and in-laws Prince Charles and Camilla at the James Bond premier in London.In a rare joint engagement, the senior royals stepped out onto the red carpet and met  star Daniel Craig.  Kate looked stunning in a custom sparkling gold sequinned Jenny Packham cape gown and wore her hair up to show off her beautul gold earrings by Onitaa. And when she greeted Bond actor Craig, he told her: You look jolly lovely.

With last winter disrupted by lockdown, and young people missing so much school, college, time with friends and seeing grandparents, getting the vaccine will help make sure this year is a whole lot better. Not only does the vaccine protect young people against serious illness – almost  per cent of Covid patients admitted to hospital are unvaccinated – it also means they’re less likely to spread the virus to elderly family members. No more FOMO We’ve come a long way with the vaccination programme since those dark days of last winter. The Covid- vaccine has already saved more than , lives and prevented  million infections.Jabs are now being rolled out for the - age group, and more than  per cent of --year-olds have already had theirs. And getting the jab couldn’t be easier: schools and colleges are offering it through their immunisation programmes, while older teenagers can make an appointment through the online booking service at nhs.uk covidvaccination.If you’re a parent orof a --year-old, schools will ask for your consent before they receive the vaccine, and you can help --year-olds book their dose online. Then it’s one less thing for you to worry about – and they won’t need to worry about missing out on all those good times with family and friends.Fashion and lestyle influencer Arabella Daho , , is keen to book her vaccine appointment. “I think the vaccine is a great thing for everyone to have – it’s helping to keep us safe, she says. We have loads of events coming up such as Halloween and Christmas, and we don’t want to miss them. “On my digital s I’ve interviewed a few of the doctors who worked on the vaccine, talking about how safe it is, and why it’s important for everyone to get it. It was good to talk to them – I learned a lot, soanyone wants to see those videos or do research to help them feel better about getting the vaccine, I think they should. “Young people think they’re immune to everything, but we can actually be spreading Covid, especially to older people, who are more vulnerable. So getting jabbed helps communities and families get back to normal.” ‘All my kids have had their vaccines’ We asked GP and mum-of-three Dr Dawn Harper about what the vaccine means for young people… How do you feel about your kids being offered the vaccine  All my kids are in their s and they’ve all had their vaccines. I was very keen for them to get vaccinated as soon as they were eligible. If I had a -to--year-old I’d be putting them forward for the vaccine. We’ve been able to draw on global data several countries have already been offering the vaccine to --year-olds, and we have a lot of evidence to show that it’s safe for that age group. And while young people are less likely to become seriously ill with Covid, I am in total agreement with the chief medical officers concerning the impact on their mental health and their education, and also the possibility of long Covid. And, of course, we are only enjoying the relative freedoms we have today in the UK because of the vaccine programme. Without it, we’d still be in a lockdown. We need the vaccine to protect ourselves from Covid and long Covid, and also to protect our loved ones and our community. So I’m very keen for young people to come forward and have the vaccine. Did you have to persuade your children to have the jab  They were up for it. For me, lockdown was easier: I’m  and don’t mind walking my dog on my own, but I think young people really struggled missing out on their social lives.  What are the side effects of the vaccine in young people  The main one is perhaps a bit of soreness in the arm. I had a sore arm after my first vaccine but nothing at all after my second. It’s incredibly safe. I’m still amazed at how the researchers worked to get this to market as quickly as they did, running trials simultaneously without cutting safety corners. Long Covid is a worry for many parents. Will the vaccine protect young people against it  I have patients with long Covid. It is a horrible condition and there is evidence that the vaccine protects against this. We’re still on a very steep learning curve with long Covid. It’s unpredictable. We have fit young people who have been knocked sideways by it. The things that people talk to me about is the fatigue, the brain fog – I’ve got patients who are very intelligent academics who just can’tat work. Is the vaccine suitable for vegans and people with food allergies  It’s totally vegan-friendly and not a problem for those with allergies. What about those who are scared of needles  For the -to- age group, school nurses are well experienced in managing this. If you’re nervous you can ask to lie down. You can also buy over-the-counter cream to rub into your arm  minutes beforehand. I don’t even think I felt my second vaccine going in it’s such a tiny needle. For a moment of a sharp scratch, to know that you’re protected against Covid it’s well worth the trade-off. Has the vaccine been rigorously tested on the younger age group  Yes, I feel very confident about the science behind it. There’s been a lot of debate on risk vs benefit in dferent age groups. Young people are less likely to get seriously ill, but we need to weigh that against missed education, protection from long Covid and letting kids get out and about again so that we can help them with any mental health issues. If you come from a middle-class background where you’ve all got your own computers, home schooling was much easier thanyou’re all trying to share one screen, so it’s really important that we try to even out those dferences and get people back into the classroom.Last winter’s lockdown was so tough on young people’s mental health. Does the vaccine mean that things will be better this year  That wouldbe my hope. We’ll see messages coming out about meeting outside and ventilation I still wear a mask in the supermarket we have hand sanitiser in our bags and our cars, and I think that makes sense. But expanding the vaccine programme to include these younger people will mean that hopefully they can start to get back to some kind of normality. AGED  OR  If you have a teenager who hasn’t booked their vaccine yet, you can give them a helping hand so that they don’t get left behind – and protect the rest of the family from serious illness. Jabs can now be booked online at nhs.uk covidvaccination, or you can ask your GP or go to your nearest walk-in centre. PARENT OR CARER OF A --YEAR-OLD Offering young people the vaccine is essential to prevent them missing school and help make sure they can carry on doing the things they love with their friends and family. Everyone in this age group will be offered a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine through their school’s immunisation programme, which already administers the HPV and MMR vaccines. Parents and s will be asked for their consent via a form – andyou have any questions you can discuss them with the School Age Immunisation Service."},{"url":null,"title":"i wear niqab most islamophobic","story":":root Exclusive: I wear a niqab in the most Islamophobic place in Britain and its terryingMum-of-three Souad Mohammed, from Westminster says she is verbally abused every day and was almost set on fire when youths ignited her niqab with a lighterSouad Mohammed holding her veil which was allegedly set on fire by youths on a bus Image: Daily MirrorByMatthew DreschReporter:,  Oct | commentsA Muslim woman living in the most Islamophobic place in Britain says she is scared to go outside wearing her niqab. Souad Mohammed, , claims she is verbally abused on a daily basis and was almost set on fire when youths burned her veil last year. She lives in the London borough of Westminster, which has the highest number of Islamophobic hate crimes in the capital. The mum-of-three has been called an aposISIS brideapos and aposOsama Bin Ladenaposs weapos while out in public. Souad, who was born in Westminster, told The Mirror: “It’s very unsafe to live here. I get anxiety every time I go out. “In all the years I’ve worn the niqab as of late it’s been the worst it’s ever been. “I can’t go to Mayfair alone, I have to be accompanied because of fear of attack.  “Last year I was on the top deck of a bus in Harrow Road and some guys behind me tried to light my niqab with a lighter. “I heard the clicking of the lighter and realised what was happening. They burnt a bit of it. “I turned around and said ‘what do you think you are doing ’ They were shocked when I had an English accent. “They got aggressive and I had to get off the bus.” Souad said the constant abuse has made her feel like a ‘reject of societyapos. Thugs have even branded her an ‘ISIS bride’ in public because of her niqab, she said. In one particularly terrying episode, she claims a bus passenger called her ‘Osama Bin Laden’s we’ and accused her of being a suicide bomber. She said: “When I got on the bus I received a text message. Someone called out from behind and said to the bus driver ‘stop the bus she’s going to detonate’. “He was saying ‘you are going to get blown up any time now’ and told people I was Osama Bin Laden’s we. I had to get off the bus, the driver didn’t do anything.” Souad said the shocking incident took place on the  bus in Bayswater, Westminster, earlier this year.  She suffered another upsetting incident as she tried to board a bus in Edgware Road, Westminster, in January . Souad said: “I was going to ask her something about my journey and she didn’t want to speak to me. “She said ‘I don’t want to talk to you with that dirty thing on your face’. I said can you repeat that again. She repeated it, I said that’s racist and she said ‘I don’t give a s**t’.” The mum claims the driver then told her to get off the bus and closed the doors on her as she left. Souad reported the incident to police and although it was logged, no further action was taken. In another shocking episode the community worker claims a man drew a kne on her and a friend, who was also wearing a niqab, when they were shopping in Mayfair last year.  “He said he would stab us in our c***s and called us b****es. He told us we ‘better take that s**t off your faces’,” she said. “My friend saw a police car and they chased him up the road. He went to court and was prosecuted. The police rang and told us.” Souad said she has stopped reporting incidents to the police as they happen so often. “If I was to keep on reporting I would have files and files of paperwork,” she added. Souad started wearing the niqab after coming across passages in the Quran as a teenager in the late s.  She was the first in her family to wear the religious garment, which gave her spiritual fulfilment and made her feel less vulnerable to sexual harassment. However, she detected a backlash against the veil, in particular after the   bombings in Edgware Road, Westminster, and other parts of London.The mum said Boris Johnson ’s description of women who wear burqas as ‘letterboxes’ had also led to people shouting the insult at her from across the street.She added: “If politicians are calling us letterboxes, what do you think members of the public will do ” Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Mr Johnson previously apologised for his aposletterboxapos remarks, which he made in a Dailycolumn in . Former London Assembly member Murad Qureshi previously confronted Mr Johnson over ‘visible Muslim women’ being abused in the capital. Mr Qureshi said the Prime Minister’s comments had not helped women ‘at the sharp end’ of abuse. He added that the Met Police only pursue the most severe Islamophobic hate crimes – and the rate of cases that are actually solved is low. The former Assembly member believes this is due to limited police resources and the dficult nature of proving a hate crime. He said: “If I get brushed off in a pub is it because I’m a rival football fan or because of the colour of my skin, it’s hard to tell.” Muslim Engagement  Development , an organisation campaigning against Islamophobia, said official data shows London has the highest rate of religious hate crimes in the UK. Faiza Mukith, head of legal at MENDaposs Islamophobia response unit, said: “When cases are reported to us, a crucial question asked of clients is ‘what were you wearing at the time of the incident’. We find that many of our clients, particularly the women who wear the face veil and headscarf, are specically targeted by their attackers because our clients are visibly Muslim.  Their attackers y from strangers on the street to iniduals providing a service. Our clients almost always stress how they never expected to be denied a bus ride, or goods they have already paid for because of what they’re wearing – leaving them traumatised and afraid to go out. Some , offences were recorded by the politan Police in  . The Met told The Mirror that  Islamophobic crimes took place in Westminster between September ,  and August  this year. Over this period, Westminster had the highest number of Islamophobic offences in the capital, with Tower Hamlets coming second after recording  crimes. A Met spokesman said: We dedicate signicant resource to investigating hate crime cases brought to our attention and encourage those who may have been a victim or witness to come forward.  From September  to August  there were  more sanction detectionsfor hate crime offences than the year before – an increase of % . The Met said it took all hate crime reports seriously it has a aposvery low thresholdapos for recording and investigating offences compared to other cities around the world. The spokesman added: London is a very erse city and the vast majority of residents and visitors treat one another with respect. Sadly, certain sections of our communities are subjected to deplorable abuse and harassment. Siwan Hayward, director of compliance, policing operations and security at TFL, said he was appalled to hear about Souadaposs experiences on London buses. He told The Mirror: “We are absolutely appalled to hear of these incidents. All forms of hate crime are completely unacceptable and we are deeply sorry that Ms Mohammed has experienced this on our network.  To help keep passengers safe each bus has CCTV and there are more than , unormed police officers on the network, as well as our own enforcement officers. “We expect the highest standards of London bus drivers and ensured the incident in  was investigated.Based on the information and evidence available to us and the police at the time the incident was reported and action was taken.He urged anyone who experiences or witnesses hate crime to report it to the police immediately.

Then they started to leave the cinema - we were all in shock and my friend asked the staff member aposarenapost you going to stop them apos She then got on to radio to security, and they stopped them outside of the cinema. In my head I was thinking I was ready to watch James Bond - but I then got told my head was hurt and basically that I needed to get first aid. They took me to the Costa in the cinema who gave me some ice for the injuries on my head, but we were told there was no one on site to deal with it as they could only deal with cuts, bruises and burns. My details were taken and I was told to go to hospital.  The -year-old man waited nine hours at AE for an X-ray and to be examined before being able to leave at am on Thursday - but has still not been able to see the James Bond movie.He says cinema staff at the time refunded the groupaposs tickets and food purchases, and gave them tickets toto a showing at another time.But the James Bond superfan says he remains upset over how he says the situation was handled. He said: We entered the cinema with our QR codes which were checked with our seat number and rows at the time and at no point did they say we needed to move until the lights went down in the cinema. Film is a massive interest of mine, itaposs massive escapism, but theyaposve basically now ruined that for me because of their bad system and mismanagement. Nobody should be assaulted full stop but one of the last places you expect it to happen is in a cinema. Weaposd gone out of our way to see that showing, the . showing was the very first one after its release. Iaposm a massive Bond fan and I also didnapost want any spoilers, you wait two years to see a film because of a pandemic, it was the most highly anticipated film of the last few years. The Odeon Cinema declined to comment when contacted by the MEN. The Mirror has reached out to the group for comment. The man says the police have still not been back in touch with him about the incident, as they attended the cinema after heaposd already been taken to hospital. When the MEN asked GMP for a comment they said: We were called at around .am on Thursday  September to a report of an assault in a cinema room at the Trafford Centre.

Sarah, , left a friend’s house in Clapham Common on Wednesday, March  and disappeared as she walked home towards Brixton. Detectives attempted to retrace her steps and cell site analysis placed her at Poynders Court on the the South Circular road just before .pm. DCI Goodwin told The Times that small stretch of road became the focus of the investigation and investigators were trying to figure out whether she had gotten into a taxi, caught a bus or gone into a nearby house.They methodically pieced together CCTV footage and bus camera video to establish a timeline and at pm on Tuesday, March  there was a breakthrough.CCTV from a bus showed Ms Everard standing next to a white car, with flashing hazard lights, that had been rented out by PC Couzens.DCI Goodwin said: “I will never forget the moment one of my team came running into my office, closed the door and told me the renter of the car was a police officer. I was in absolute shock.”  Officers were sent to the -year-old suspectaposs house in Kent while detectives used CCTV and automatic number-plate recognition cameras to figure out that he had driven his victim to rural Kent on March . “Whilst we were open to all possibilities, including the worst, I and the team were massively hoping that there was another explanation — Sarah had got into a cab, had got on to a bus and her card hadn’t registered the journey,” said DCI Goodwin. We wanted so much for her to be alive and well.  Couzens burned Sarahaposs body in a refrigerator in an area of woodland he owned in Hoads Wood, near Ashford, before dumping her remains in a nearby pond. Police dogs location the remains on March .

The judge said the married father-of-two had been been “hunting” for a victim, used his warrant card and handcuffs to snatch Ms Everard off the street using Covid lockdown rules to make a  arrest.

The pair of politan Police officers are understood to be in the chat group in which three serving officers exchanged aposvileapos WhatsApp messages with the -year-old in the months before he kidnapped and killed Sarah Everard.The Met officers have not been suspended from duty altogether, despite being under criminal investigation by the Independent Office into Police Conduct , thereports.Instead the force has placed them on restricted duties, the force admitted. In total, two constables and a former officer with the Met are under criminal investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct in relation to the message group.  A Norfolk Police officer who is being investigated for related potential disciplinary and gross misconduct offences has been suspended from duty, the force said. Another Met officer is under investigation for potential disciplinary and gross misconduct offences, as is one officer with the Civil Nuclear constabulary, which Couzens served with until he transferred to the Met in . The decision not to suspend the Met officers has been criticised by Sue Fish, a former chief constable of Nottinghamshire. She said: “That beggars belief. It sends the most appalling message. That clearly demonstrates the Met does not get it … does not get the seriousness.” Couzens is believed to have used his policing knowledge of lockdown rules to snatch Ms Everard, , from London and lure her into being handcuffed and getting into his hire car. He raped and killed her then dumped her burnt remains in woodland in Kent. It emerged earlier today that the IOPC is investigating after sick messages of a aposdiscriminatory and or inappropriate natureapos were uncovered during the Investigation into Ms Everardaposs death. The police watchdog has opened the probe into five serving and former police officers, it revealed yesterday following the killer copaposs sentencing.  An IPOC statement said the watchdog had opened an investigation into the conduct of five officers from three forces and one former officer who allegedly sent discriminatory messages as part of a WhatsApp group between March and October . The IOPC confirmed the mobile phone messages were discovered during the police investigation into Ms Everard’s murder. It has not yet revealed the exact nature of the messages, but they reportedly contained sexist, homophobic and racist content. The watchdogaposs statement said: They are being investigated for gross misconduct for allegedly sending messages of a discriminatory and or inappropriate nature, and for allegedly failing to challenge the messages sent by the others. Two of the MPS officers and the former MPS officer have also been notied that they are being criminally investigated for improper use of the public electronic communications network under Section  of the Communications Act. Criminal or gross misconduct investigations do not necessarily mean that charges or disciplinary proceedings will follow.  The investigation into the WhatsApp group is one of a series of watchdog probes linked to the Sarah Everard case. The IOPC is also continuing to investigate allegations that a probationary MPS police constable shared an inappropriate graphic, depicting violence against women, with colleagues via Whatsapp, referencing Ms Everardaposs kidnap and murder. The investigation has found that the officer, who was off-duty at the time, had at one point stood guard at a cordon as part of the search for Ms Everard. The officer was investigated for gross misconduct for potentially breaching police standards of professional behaviour for authority, respect, courtesy and conduct, the IOPC stated. Two other probationary constables were investigated for gross misconduct on the basis that they had allegedly shared the graphic and failed to challenge it.  A report on the incident was provided to the Met in August, and it is now determining what action will be taken. The watchdog has a third running investigation into serving officers, exploring allegations that officers from several forces breached standards of professional behaviour when they used a messaging app to share information connected to the prosecution of Couzens. One officer was investigated for gross misconduct as there was an indication they had shared details presented in court from an interview given by Couzens under caution, when there was no policing purpose to do so, the IOPC said. A further six officers were served with misconduct notices as there was an indication that they failed to challenge the sharing of the information, and that two of them also joined in the conversation, the watchdog added. The IOPCaposs conclusions were shared with affected forces in August, and the organisation said it would publish itaposs findings when it had made final decisions on potential disciplinary action for all officers concerned. In the wake of yesterdayaposs sentencing, politan Police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick described Couzens crimes as one of the most dreadful events in the -year history of the Met. This man has brought shame on the Met, she said. Speaking frankly, as an organisation we have been rocked, she said. I absolutely know that there are those who feel that trust in us is shaken. I recognise that for some people, a precious bond of trust has been damaged. Many senior public figures, including Labour MP Harriet Harman, have called on Dame Cressida to resign. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britainaposs most senior police officer still had his support on Friday.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON WhatsAppNorfolk Policepolitan PoliceCrimeSarah Everard\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It came five years after a toddler had been given an overdose of prescription medication at the facility. Bosses wrote to inform parents about the incident on Thursday last week that the totaposs death occurred due to a sudden and very unexpected medical need.

Nursery manager Debbie Alcock wrote in an email to parents: You will be aware that last week on Thursday we needed to ask for emergency services to attend the nursery due to a sudden and very unexpected medical need.

Aktar Islam, who appears on Saturday Kitchen, said he forked out £, of his own money defending himself against the utterly disgusting and disgraceful lie.The -year-old won an employment tribunal last month following the claim by former assistant general manager, Sara Cowie, Birmingham Mail reported. The tribunal dismissed her claims the she was let go at the end of her-three month probation because she was expecting a child.  Following the tribunal Mr Islam said: The past three years have been a living hell trying to fight this utterly disgraceful lie. I have spent £, from my own pocket defending myself. It has caused me tremendous financial, mental and emotional strain. I just feel sheer relief that it is over, but I am so angry that this person chose to use her womanhood as a weapon to extort money from me. My businesses have been built on my name, and this woman was trying not only to take money from me but, more damagingly, take away my reputation too. To be accused of something as disgusting as discrimination against a pregnant inidual is hurtful as I am a parent myself and employ many parents that I have supported throughout maternity and paternity. I have also promoted a female employee who was pregnant, so to claim that I would want to sack someone just on this basis is horrying to me. What adds to my pain is that I employed Ms Cowie because I was friends with her partner. I really canapost understand why this lie continued for so long.Mr Islam, who closed Legna restaurant in December  due to location issues, has two acclaimed restaurants in the city - Michelin starred Opheem and steak restaurant Pulperia.  He first employed Ms Cowie to work at Legna in October . It was very clear to me and other managers that Ms Cowieaposs job performance was poor, but because of my friendship with Mr Ternent, I decided not to let her go immediately and keep her on over Christmas so she wouldnapost need to worry about a job, he continued. Instead, I verbally explained to her in December that I would keep her on until the end of her probation period at the end of January. Mr Islam said he placed advertisements for her role on job sites including Caterer before Ms Cowie came to him, and revealed she was aposone to two weeks late on her periodapos. A few days before the probation meeting and formal dismissal, she confirmed her pregnancy in writing. However, the job adverts proved irrefutable tribunal evidence that Ms Cowie had not been unfairly dismissed due to her pregnancy. The chef-owner added: I started advertising for her role in late - before even she knew she was pregnant, so when she came to me with her news, we both already the job was ending. I have never had any staff member come to me so early in their pregnancy.He said she was offered three alternative roles within the company but chose not to find out more about these other work opportunities. Instead, Ms Cowie contacted the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Serviceand appointed a solicitor, and drafted a statement within  hours of her end of probation meeting ending.  Mr Islam said: I had verbally told her before she revealed she was pregnant that it was not working out, but thankfully I had the evidence to back that up - as I had started advertising for her job - weeks before she was pregnant.Mr Islam told us: When I got the ACAS letter, I felt I had been punched in the face. I was totally shell shocked.Ms Cowieaposs initial claim demanded £, for unfair dismissal and discrimination. He said: I was getting numerous emails askingI would settle out of courts and pay the £k. They saw me as a cash cow - because I would be worried about my reputation, and the legal bills in defending yourself in court is always more than settling out of court. But for me, it was the principle of the matter - that this person thought it was okay to do this. The mental impact on myself and my team has been immense - particularly as many of my staff were friendly with Ms Cowie and Mr Ternent. Birminghamaposs hospitality scene is a very tight-knit and supportive community so this fracture has been hellish. My friends and family were supportive, but it was embarrassing to know people might be questioning my behaviour - whether I was capable of doing what I had been accused of.Mr Islam a Michelin star for Indian restaurant Opheem in . He said he could not fully enjoy what should have been a happy time celebrating his success due to the dark cloud hanging over him. Throughout this, Iaposve had to clear my name, he said. Itaposs just heart-breaking that the money Iaposve spent on my defence would have been of great help considering what the hospitality sector has had to endure over the last eighteen months. The money is the equivalent of one yearaposs rent for one of the restaurants or a yearaposs salary for two trainee chefs. The findings of the Employment Tribunal Decision, which is now available online, states: The claimantaposs claim against the first respondent that she was unfairly dismissed under s  Employment Rights Act  is not well-founded and is dismissed. The claimantaposs claim against the first and second respondents that she was discriminated against in relation to her pregnancy under s  Equality Act is unsuccessful and is dismissed.

The decision would have come shortly after the Dukeaposs disastrous Newsnight interview, in which he denied having sex with Ms Giuffre, claiming he was in Pizza Express at the time of the alleged encounter. Last week Andrew added Melissa Lerner to his legal team, the latest Lavley Singer lawyer to come on board after Andrew Brettler. The Los-Angeles law firm is known for representing celebrities. Brettler is reportedly charging ,an hour as Andrewaposs lead counsel. The funds will be sourced from her annual income from the Duchy of Lancaster estate, Thereports. This recently increased by £.million to £million. The case could take months or years to resolve, and any settlement could well stretch into the millions of pounds.  Ms Giuffre has accused the Duke of sexually assaulting her on three separate occasions when she was . He vehemently denies the allegations. She claims she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with Andrew when she was aged  and a minor under US law. One such alleged occasion was at the London home of Epsteinaposs longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell. She also said Andrew abused her at around the same time at Epsteinaposs mansion in Manhattan and on Epsteinaposs private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Epstein was found dead in his cell at a Manhattan federal jail in August  while he awaited a sex trafficking trial. The death was ruled to be suicide. It is not clearthe Queenaposs financial intervention was necessary or an act of kindness. However, Prince Andrewaposs personal finances remain something of a mystery as he has no discernible income. He is said to be selling a Swiss ski chalet he bought for £million with his ex-we the Duchess of York to settle debts with the previous owner.

But police officers from Stone County Sherfaposs Department in Missouri soon spotted the illicit items, obtained a search warrant and arrested the -year-old at his home in Reeds Spring on Wednesday. They also seized almost  grams of methamphetamine and the Taurus revolver. Stone County Sherf Doug Rader believes the bumbling salesman must have been under the influence when he took the photograph because he left his large bag of meth and syringe on the coffee table. When he was being questioned by officers, he said he did not realised the illicit items were in the photograph. “Take note,you are selling items on social media, make sure your drugs are not in the background!” he posted on Facebook.Today we arrived at this gentleman’s house with a search warrant. You can imagine his surprise!! “He still had  grams of meth and a pistol that he is forbidden to own!”  “We have now provided him a new place to stay.” Kertz remains in custody at Stone County Jail without bond and faces charges of possessing a controlled substance and parole violation. Anyone wanting to purchase the catalytic converter will have to wait. The item is currently not for sale. Kertz has previous convictions for resisting arrest, third-degree domestic assault, possession of a controlled substance, and endangering the welfare of a child, according to KY. Police records show he served time at Algoa Correctional Center Missouri after he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for drug offences. Sherf Rader told the news station: During the execution of the search warrant, there was  grams of methamphetamine found in the residence and a handgun. Not only did I get the original tip, I had numerous people send us Facebook messages about the same post so I appreciate our Stone County residents for looking out for this kind of thing.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON FacebookLe sentenceCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Now one way to seethe device is a camera is to shine a bright light at it. If you hit a camera lens it’s going to get a blue-ish reflection, he says as he flashes his torch at it and reveals a camera. He then moved to the digital alarm clock beside the bed, where he showed how a USB charger could even be home to a pinhole camera. These cameras are really small as you can see here, so they can be hidden in anything, even a hole in the wall, he said. You’re going to want to check any suspicious devices or holes that are facing the shower, dressing area or the bed. He then demonstrated how to spot infrared LEDs to help detect night vision cameras. The front-facing camera is the only one that tends to work as the back-facing one has an IR filter, he explained. Although Hutchins explained that the video didnapost take place in a real Airbnb and was staged for the purpose of the video, he added that the threat was still real. Since being posted, the video has received . million likes and , comments, with many people saying they have a new reason not to leave home. One person said: New fear unlocked. Another wrote: Fantastic, another thing to be paranoid about. A third commented: I would stare at the camera the whole time and scare them.

Korey, who operates as a service dog for his diabetic owner, monitors her blood sugar levels and lets his owner know when they are too high, as shown in this cute video.The clip, which was posted by TikTok user @koreythekanine, was a massive hit on the app, with over , views and over , likes.The video shows how Korey reacts when he realises that his owner’s blood sugar levels are high, something he has been trained to do.  Diabetic alert dogs are trained to recognise the dference between certain scents and use their heightened sense of smell in order to detect whether a person’s blood sugar is high or low. Korey shows these skills in practice in the clip, by detecting his owner’s high blood sugar levels and alerting her by getting her attention by spinning in a circle and staring at her. Viewers were clearly impressed by Korey’s training, with one user commenting: “Such a good baby! Love him!”Fetch. Chase. Eat. Sleep.

The man explains through captions the lawnmower is still tucked away and that he had planned on mowing the clover this year. However, he simply couldn’t bring himself to get rid of the field of clover, thanks to his Chihuahua’s love of the greenery.  The closing shot of the clip shows his Chihuahua enjoying the soft, natural bed, with her head peeking out above the clovers.

But one man was very freaked out to discover some bones in the wall of his property.TikTok user @franceschuckieraven has gone viral on the video-sharing  after sharing a clip of his creepy find.He shared a look at the bones, saying: Waiting for cops to come, found some bones in my wall - are they human  I donapost f***ing know. I hope not though.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here. More than two million people watched the TikTok video, with many sharing their thoughts on the bones in the comments below.A number of people agreed the bones definitely werenapost human, with some saying they might have belonged to a cow. But even still, it was bizarre that they ended up in the wall of a house. One person wrote: Looks like cattle bones, but normally not found in walls. Another said: Archaeologist here, not human. But very scary to seeyou donapost know what to look for. Iaposve seen people think more random stuff was human. A third added: Depending on how old your house is, it used to be common to put dead pets in the wall as a way for them to protect you and the house in the afterle. In a series of follow-up videos, Frances explained how he bagged up the bones and took them to the police to investigate. He shows off where in his house he discovered them, believing they fell through a loft space and becoming concerned someone could be living in the creepy space and he could be killed. However, the mystery is later solved and his le is confirmed to be safe as police inform him that the bones are actually from lamb chops. He adds: Just got a call back from the cops and the lady said, aposthe results are in, theyaposre lamb chop bonesapos. So that was a complete waste of their time, but what am I meant to do  Why are they in my wall  I canapost leave my wall bones there.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Theories for the disappearance have ranged from something as benign as technical failure to as sinister as mass murder-suicide by Zaharie Ahmad Shah, , the Malaysian captain. The last search was carried out in  by marine robotics company Ocean Infinity with unmanned underwater vehicles covering nearly , square miles but nothing was ever recovered. However, according to a report in The Times newspaper, trials of a new technology capable of tracking historical data on radio signals bumping off aircraft fuselages could hold the key to finally locating the missing airliner.  The technology has proven to be so successful that its pioneers believe it may even be possible to chart MH’s last minutes with a signicantly increased precision, narrowing down the search area for investigators. The British aerospace engineer Richard Godfrey ran tests using a little-known online database set up in , known as the Weak Signal Propagation Reporter , which records every interaction between aircraft in the sky and signals sent by ground-based radio transmitters. He told The Times: Imagine crossing a prairie with invisible tripwires crossing the whole area and going back and forth across theand breadth. Each step you make you tread on particular tripwires and we can locate you at the intersection of the disturbed tripwires. We can track your path as you move across the prairie.  He used the method to track the flight path of a New Zealand Air Force Orion aircraft that photographed debris on the surface of the ocean soon after MH disappeared. While the debris was never recovered, it included a large  resembling a Boeing  wing component, which many experts now suspect was part of MH. Ocean Infinity said it was aware of the trials and said: “We are always interested in resuming the search whether as a result of new information or new technology.” Comment MORE ON Malaysia Airlines crashFlight MH\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Academics agree that a sustainable level of material use, which would still allow for a high quality of le, is about eight tonnes per person per year.Zero Waste Scotland is advocating for mindful shopping, encouraging Scots to buy smarter and adopt reuse, repair and renting behaviours as well as embracing second-hand shopping.When finished with an item, it is calling on people to dispose of items responsibly by donating, reselling or recycling.With global climate change discussions at an all-time high and COP coming to Glasgow this November, the topic of responsible consumption in relation to the climate crisis has never been more timely.Everything we buy has a carbon cost and we are urging Scots to think dferently about what we buy and how we consume.Changing our own consumption habits is the single biggest thing we can all do to play our part in tackling climate change.Now is the time for action and we want people to bin less and buy better, seeking out items which will last longer.Responsible consumption isn’t on the COP agenda so we wanted to ensure it is top of the consumer agenda.To learn more about the campaign, please visit www.howtowasteless for further details.Iain Gulland, chief executive, Zero Waste Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

The P  team drew six tries-all and the P- team won by six tries to four.Next they played Kintyre with the P s losing by five tries to two and the P s winning again four tries to three.The last game for both teams came against Oban and this time the P  team won by three tries to one and the superb P  team won by five tries to three to complete a clean sweep on the day.Lee Buckley of Mid Argyll RFC said: #The coaches at Mid Argyll would like to thank two under- players, Donald Self and William Wilson, who came along on the day and refereed all the games.#I think the boys were surprised by the quality of the rugby and the speed of some of the mini players, as they tried to keep up with them.#During the day Argyll and Bute rugby development officer Andrew Johnston took all the girl players aside to record a good luck message for the Scotland women#s national team who took on Spain the following day in a crucial world cup qualying match.The message must have done the trick as Scotland ran out  #  victors to keep their world cup dream alive.If any young people would like to play rugby either as a ing player or a complete novice, training sessions for all primary age children and S- high school girls is at pm on Tuesdays on the rugby pitch at the joint campus in Lochgilphead.High School training for S- boys and girls is held on Thursdays at pm at the joint campus.For any ing ex-players or novice adults, men and women who want to give rugby a try for the first time, have a look on Mid Argyll Rugby Club#s Facebook page for details of when the #old-timers# touch rugby sessions are being held.This week#s Dalriada festival on September  is being hosted by Oban Lorne RFC.Players should arrive at Oban Rugby Club no later than .am for a noon start.PICS:Mid Argyll P  team. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllMid Argyll P  team. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllDonald and William refereed the games. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllThe girls had a great day # and even recorded a good luck message for the Scotland women#s national team. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllAction from the P  match between Mid Argyll and Etive Vikings, which Mid Argyll won by six tries to four.

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another. It is not about me, my job, my reputation, my status.

We were delighted to welcome them to Argyll for their first performance as a quartet and for three of the four performers this was the first time they had performed in more than a year.The quartet # Andrew, Dean, Jack and Richard # introduced each piece, giving background to both the role of the saxophone and the composer, with many of the pieces arranged by the group themselves.Purcell’s #Festival Rondeau# was the dramatic opening, a work well-known across all age groups, so a perfect start to the concert.Following this was a work composed specically for a saxophone quartet in  by Jean-Baptiste Singelée, a friend of Adolph Sax who invented the saxophone. We were treated to the traditional Andante before moving onto the exciting Allegro.The third selection of pieces were all by Debussy. This was a surprising choice as the saxophone is not really associated with the Impressionist period, however, it showed the versatility of both the saxophones and performers. #Arabesque No.# was followed by #The Little Shepherd# which was delightful, calm and serene with only the sound of the river flowing through the trees and birds singing along. The jaunty #Cakewalk# completed this ied section.#Air on a G String# by Bach and known to many as a TV advert was the next offering. The opening descending bass line showed the depth and quality of the baritone saxophone in much more than just a supporting role. This music predates the invention of the saxophone by more than  years.Gershwin and a selection of show tunes from the swing era were just what we needed after the relaxing #Air#. The four musical songs, all showcasing dferent styles, certainly had the audience smiling, toe-tapping and singing along. In the final piece #I Got Rhythm# we were all moving to the music, including the quartet. Closing your eyes, you could imagine you were relaxing in a jazz club anywhere in the world.The next piece, #L’Arlesienne Exhibition#, is a collection of highlights for the saxophone in an orchestral situation. The music was composed by Hiroki Takahashi, with many familiar themes from film and TV # including The Apprentice # all thoroughly enjoyable.Gershwin’s #An American in Paris# portrays the many sights and sounds that Gershwin experienced there in the s. While it was composed for an orchestra which included saxophones and car horns, the music played by the quartet didn’t include any car horns # just skilled and imaginative saxophonists.A change of pace to enjoy some relaxed, laid-back music from West Africa followed with Will Gregory’s #High Le#. The repeated rhythms with the peace of Kilmory, the cooling air and the gentle river flowing was almost hypnotic and brought the concert to a finish.The audience cheered, clapped and blew their cars horns to ensure the quartet provided an encore. #Witch Hunt# by Ulrich Schultheiss was the encore # a dramatic and fiery work challenging all the performers and bringing a fantastic concert to a close.The quartet members themselves didn#t feel the cars were a barrier and said they #had a blast at a unique and special event#.MAAA thank the th Argyll Scoutsfor helping with the car parking. Traffic cones and hi-vis waistcoats were loaned by MacLeods and the wagon we used as a stage was from Ferguson#s Butchers. Picnic boxes were pre-ordered from Lucy’s Ardfern.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

Try and get evergreens planted by the end of the month.Dormant roses are now available at local nurseries and garden centres and are very good value for money.You can easily create a rose garden for the coming year that will provide beautul flowers and fragrance from early summer through to autumn. Before planting, mix in some good quality compost and make sure the plants are watered well once planted.It#s an excellent time to plant coners as well. Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces, and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is Heuchera.Native to north America, Heuchera were originally grown for their flowers # dainty spikes of red, pink and white bells.They carry their plume like flowers high above their crowns of leaves, but gardeners are now mainly interested in their foliage which comes in a iety of colours.Heucheras grow in full or partial sun, in well composted soil and are fairly pest resistant.They can be established as ground cover in many garden situations like under trees where grass could struggle.October is often a time spent clearing up after the summer and preparing for the winter and wpring ahead so here are some top tips for jobs this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"gardens of argyll in new tv series","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowTwo Argyll gardens will appear in a new BBC ALBA series which started last week.Gàrraidhean Mòra na h-Alba, or Gardens of Scotland is presented by Murdo Macdonald, and the programme will feature Ardkinglas and Benmore gardens.In a programme screened on Thursday September  and available on BBC iPlayer, it was the turn of Ardkinglas Garden at the head of Loch Fyne.There, Murdo finds out about the model railway that used to run along the lochside, and wanders around the azaleas bursting with colour in the Ladies# Garden.He walks up to the old mill by the river, then explores the champion trees and renowned rhododendron collection in the Woodland Garden.He also finds out more about the fairy garden for children which is made up of lots of little houses next to the bottom of tree trunks, laid out in trail.#The fairy garden attracts thousands of families each year so it#s become a destination in itself,# said Murdo. #The Ladies# Garden with azaleas is also well worth seeing in summer it’s stunning because it#s ablaze with colour.#On October , Gàrraidhean Mòra na h-Alba will showcase Benmore Garden at the end of Loch Eck, a regional garden of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.Murdo visits the Victorian fernery, the Tasmanian Ridge and the Chilean Rainforest Glade, where he plants a monkey puzzle tree.Murdo said: #Benmore is a dramatic garden in its terrain with amazing views and you could easily spend days walking around, just taking in what’s there.#There’s a wildness to the garden that isn’t as apparent at some of the other more formal gardens which can almost make you feel as though you’re in a dferent country.#"},{"url":null,"title":"glendaruel hosts tighnabruaich open","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowGlendaruel and Colintraive Gun Club hosted the Tighnabruaich Open on September , the first club competition to be held since March .The High Gun of the day, after a three-way shoot off, was Ted Blakeway.In second was Alan Brown third, Paul Chalmers and fourth equal were Martin Young,  Gordon Grfiths and Eric McAllister.The ladies prize went to Jessica Young.

Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is heuchera.Native to North America, heucheras were originally grown for their flowers – dainty spikes of red, pink and white bells.They carry their plume like flowers high above their crowns of leaves, but gardeners are now mainly interested in their foliage which comes in a iety of colours.Heucheras grow in full or partial sun, in well composted soil and are fairly pest resistant.They can be established as ground cover in many garden situations like under trees where grass could struggle.October is often a time spent clearing up after the summer and preparing for the winter and spring ahead so here are some top tips for jobs next month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"blue bin recycling service to start in kintyre and gigha","story":"It comes after a controversial decision by Argyll and Bute councillors in February not to extend Kintyre Recycling Limited#skerbside collection contract which it had fulfilled since .The council says the new service is designed to make it more convenient for people in Kintyre to recycle and will be sustainable in the long-term as new government legislation for waste disposal and recycling comes into place.The new dates for scheduled uplts are on the council website at www.argyll-bute.gov.uk kintyre-new-recycling-serviceThey can also be downloaded and printed out as calendars.Those who previously received a printed copy of the calendar will be sent a new one, and those who receive an assisted uplt for their green household waste bin, will automatically receive an assisted uplt for their new blue bin.The materials picked up for recycling in Kintyre go to the Lingerton waste and recycling facility, in Lochgilphead, which is operated by Renewi on behalf of the council.Once there, it is bulked up with the rest of the blue bin recycling from Mid Argyll and sent on to a materials recycling facility in Linwood.Information on how the dferent types of material are sorted and processed can be found on the council#s website at www.argyll-bute.gov.uk what-happens-your-recyclingA very small percentage of properties, mainly tenements, will stay on a bagged service.

This includes Memorandums of Understanding with Orkney Harbour Authority and Scrabster Harbour Trust to enhance port infrastructure and position the area more competitively to support offshore wind projects in the future.The announcement of this bid comes after the completion of the leasing round of Scotwind, a programme which will lease areas of the seabed around Scotland for wind farm developments.The Scottish Government hopes that as much as ten gigawatts of new generating capacity will be built over the next decade.Stephen Kerr, project director of the West of Orkney Windfarm, said: “While ScotWind has created the opportunity for a global industry to tap into Europe’s best wind resource, our consortium believes that success will be driven by targeted proposals built upon strong local relationships.”We have designed our bid specically around this location and brought together a unique combination of stakeholders to maximise the opportunities for the region.“In particular, the upcoming round of offshore wind projects are a terric opportunity for ports in Caithness and Orkney to win signicant long-term contracts in the installation and operational phase of these major infrastructure schemes.“Our agreements with Scrabster Harbour Trust and Orkney Harbour Authority will enable us to work together with a clear focus on long term delivery. Each port has its own specic capabilities and attributes, and on successful site award we have committed to fund collaborative design and supply studies and to invest where appropriate in improving each harbour’s infrastructure.“We will apply a similar collaborative approach across the supply chain, working closely with Scottish and UK suppliers to deliver on climate targets and enhance local economies.”The consortium has undertaken extensive site investigations, including birds, marine mammals and near-shore geophysical surveys, and has finalised a grid connection agreement with National Grid that will enable the project to commence generation in .Jim Buck, harbourmaster for Orkney Harbour Authority, said that Scapa Flow # the second largest natural harbour in the world # offers an environment like no other and said that the £million masterplan to develop ports around Orkney is key in attracting new business to the islands. “Our Masterplan embraces decarbonisation and a transition away from fossil fuels,” said Mr Buck.“It includes a range of infrastructure enhancements across key locations around the Orkney mainland, including a new deep-water facility in Scapa Flow, which will be crucial to us realising our ambition to deliver social and economic benefit from offshore wind energy.“The West of Orkney Windfarm is ideally positioned to make signicant use of these future facilities and this collaboration represents another key step on our journey to position Orkney as a base for innovation and a major contributor in delivering a carbon-free future for the islands.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She has topped independent public opinion surveys on who should lead the country next.But after her father declared he would seek the vice presidency, she announced she would not run for president, saying she and her father had agreed that only one Duterte would run for a national office next year.There was no immediate reaction on Saturday from Ms Duterte, who has gone on a week-long medical leave.Mr Duterte took office in  and immediately launched a crackdown on illegal drugs that has left more than , mostly petty suspects dead and alarmed Western governments and human rights groups.The International Criminal Court has launched an investigation into the killings but he has vowed not to co-operate with the inquiry and allow investigators to enter the country.Mr Duterte was a former long-time Davao city mayor, government prosecutor and legislator in a colourful political career that spanned more than two decades.He will be remembered by many for his extra-tough approach to criminality that earned him nicknames such as ldquoDuterte Harry, after Clint Eastwoodrsquos police character who had little regard for the law.When he exits from politics, he is likely to be hounded by lawsuits arising from his violent anti-criminality campaign. He cited that concern in July as one of the reasons why he accepted the ruling PDP-Laban partyrsquos nomination for him to be its vice-presidential candidate.A top human rights group said Mr Duterte will do everything in his power to support a friendly successor and will use his lingering influence in retirement to shield himself from an array of potential criminal charges.Carlos Conde of Human Rights Watch said: ldquoEluding accountability for human rights abuses is Dutertersquos primary concern as his presidency winds down.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

MacRae raced onto Jordan Fraser#s lofted pass and as MacDonald advanced the Shiel attacker kept a cool head to deftly clip the ball home and make it -.The goal knocked the stuffing out of Lovat, who struggled to create much in the way of clear chances thereafter. And deep into injury-time MacRae completed the fairy tale with another adroit finish for the hat-trick.There were no shortage of contenders for the Albert Smith medal for man of the match # but the award, now in its th year, went to defensive lynchpin Conor Cormack.After the match the -year-old hat-trick-hero, who previously feared he might have to quit the game after a succession of knee injuries, said: #It#s not really sunk it yet # at the final whistle we had people running to us and crying. It will take a while and maybe it will be a few days before it all hits home.#It#s something we all hoped hadn#t passed us by # you need a good run of games, and fortunately it has worked out for us this year. It#s an amazing feeling.#Kinlochshiel manager Johnston Gill, who has now led the club to the Premier League, MacAulay Cup and Camanachd Cup, added: #Lovat gave us a hard time of it, but we had Keith MacRae on fire today # the whole team were brilliant. #It was nip and tuck after they came back to - but I think we shaded the game as a whole.#We knew the threat they carried, but Fraser Heath was well marked by Finlay MacRae and Conor did a great job against Greg Matheson. #We got our tactics right and used our subs well # they were all outstanding.#It#s a fantastic day # most of the community is here with us in Oban # they are great for us, and give us fantastic backing. We will all enjoy it!#Meanwhile, earlier in the day Skye Camanachd also had a victory to savour as their under- team lted the Ken MacMaster Cup.Goals from Seonaidh MacLeod and Alasdair Stewart sealed a - win over Fort William."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SHIEL-FOR-THE-CUP-3-1.jpg","title":"norrie t macdonald crofts have become the the bitcoin of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYes, it’s more of a hobby than a full-time commitment, but it’s ‘in the blood’.. But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4108705.jpg--.jpg?1632478259000\n","title":"craigdun bids fond farewell to wilma","story":"CRAIGDUN Private Nursing Home in Cullybackey has bid a fond farewell to Wilma Swann who retired recently after  years of dedicated employment.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.

A % deposit on a typical first-time buyer home is now around % of gross income – a record high.“Due to the historically low level of interest rates, the cost of servicing the typical mortgage is still well below the levels recorded in the run-up to the financial crisis. However, even on this measure, affordability is becoming more challenging.“For example,we look at typical mortgage payments relative to take-home pay across the country, it is notable that in the majority of UK regionsthis ratio is now above its long-run average. By contrast, pre-pandemic, this was only the case in one region .“Recent price patterns suggest an element of rebalancing is occurring where most of the regions that have seen the strongest price growth are those in which affordability is still close to or below the long-run average.”Mr Gardner said the outlook remains uncertain.He added: “Activity is likely to soften for a period after the stamp duty holiday expires at the end of September, given the incentive for people to bring forward their purchases to avoid the additional tax.“Moreover, underlying demand is likely to soften around the turn of the yearunemployment rises as Government support winds down, as seems likely.“But this is far from assured. The labour market has remained remarkably resilient to date and, evenit does weaken, there is scope for shts in housing preferences as a result of the pandemic – such as wanting more space or to relocate – to continue to support activity for some time yet.”Here are average house prices in the third quarter of this year and the annual increase, according to Nationwide Building Society:– Wales, £,, .%– Northern Ireland, £,, .%– Yorkshire and the Humber, £,, .%– Scotland, £,, .%– North West, £,, .%– North East, £,, .%– East Midlands, £,, .%– West Midlands, £,, .%– South West, £,, .%– Outer South East£,, .%– East Anglia, £,, .%– Outer politan£,, .%– London, £,, .%.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadOrange lodge condemns Parades Commission Belfast centenary parade ruling saying it creates Protestant ‘no go’ areaManaging director who admitted mobile phone repair company sold fake Apple goods fined £kCommunity ‘deeply shocked’ as man dies after single-vehicle crashEx-spook and black propaganda specialist Colin Wallace bids to lt lid on Troubles secrets in legal actionRecently renovated east Belfast property a £k gemLatest Northern IrelandClaire WilliamsonOpinionSnow Patrol concert will be extra special... and it’s something we all needCost of living crisis ‘puts our most vulnerable people at risk’Experience of Fionnuala Ross and Gladys Ganiel boost Belfast Marathon line-upNew boss Stuart King will keep Carrick moving in right direction, says David JeffreyGlenavon can match the top sides, insists manager Gary HamiltonLatestMorrisons takeover auction battle ends with £bn bid from private equity giantCltonville left disappointed we only took one point instead of three, admits boss Paddy McLaughlinPatson Daka says strong show at Selhurst Park can set Foxes on a runNHS doctors use TikTok in ‘powerhouse effort’ to encourage Covid vaccine take-upVolunteers prepare for ‘great day’ as essential part of London Marathon,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Drinking-up time will also be extended for an hour, meaning pubs and clubs can remain open until am. Restrictions on late opening on Sundays have also been removed, as have Easter drinking restrictions.It marks the first changes in licensing laws here for a quarter of a century.Read MoreNew Northern Ireland drinking laws bring industry ‘into ’ – all you need to knowStephen Flanagan, of The Front Page in Ballymena, who has been in business for  years, backed the changes to “outdated” legislation.“It’s been a long time coming, he said.New Easter opening hours will make a signicant dference to all of Northern Ireland, he said.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up He added: “Most other places around the world are open for business at Easter. Northern Ireland will be able to compete at a global level.“People are not obliged to remain open. My biggest challenge would be that the hospitality industry is under massive pressure due to Covid, particularly pubs like myself that are traditional non-food establishments.“A number of pubs have closed because they can’t conform with Covid legislation and we continue to struggle because of the social distancing issue, no dancing, no sitting at the bar and that doesn’t fit with what pubs are all about.”Pedro Donald, owner of Belfast pubs The Sunflower and The American Bar, said he won’t be taking advantage of later opening hours.“One o’clock is late enough for me and my staff and my type of pub,” he said. “We’re not a club and we don’t have dancing or late-night partying. But people might stay in my pub a little bit longer because they’re not rushing off to get into the nightclub or the late bars. They’ll have more time to do so.”He said he would consider taking advantage of later Sunday opening hoursthere was a bank holiday the following day.“Easter opening hours make a big dference. On the one hand, the tourist board was telling people to come and visit Belfast - meanwhile everything was shut. It was absolute madness. Now we’ll be able to trade as normal like any other weekend, he said.However Michael Flanagan, owner of The Glen Bar in Londonderry, said he doesn’t think the move is sensible.“We don’t need to be open  hours a day -  is enough,” he said.“Trade is a bit down at the moment and we can sell people all the drink they want up until  o’clock. It’s impossible to get taxis here at the moment. That’s why people aren’t coming out at night.“You’re going to put up your overheads - wages, electricity, heating - without doing any more business but you’ll do the same trade. A lot of my demographic are over  and they don’t want to come out until one or two o’clock in the morning.Mr Flanagan said he won’t apply for the later opening hours, explaining: “I can’t see me staying open late unless the bar is packed. You can’t justy three or four people sitting in a bar after  o’clock at night. You’re not making any money.”He added: “I agree with the new regime at Easter as that was always archaic. It had a religious slant but it should be each to their own,you want a drink on Sunday, you should be able to get one, but Sunday opening didn’t increase our turnover.”It will be some time before businesses can take advantage of the new laws as applications to the Department for Communities could take three weeks to process.Some of the changes happening from Friday will allow pubs and hotels to open until am up to  nights per year, the removal of restrictions on late opening on Sunday and licensed race tracks will be allowed to sell alcohol on SundaysCommunities Minister Deirdre Hargey said the changes will give more flexibility to pub and hotel licence holders particularly in the lead up to Christmas and the New Year.She added that the increased drinking-up time - the period which customers have to finish their final drinks and leave the pub - will support a more gradual dispersal of people from licensed premises.The chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill, said the new rules will give a much-needed boost to the industry in a signicant step forward.The entire industry has been struggling over the last  months and this will provide a confidence boost, and will bode well for the future of the hospitality offer as we plan ahead, he said.He added: We look forward to seeing the positive impacts of these changes.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsDepartment for CommunitiesDeirdre HargeyMore On Department for Communities PremiumCost of living crisis ‘puts our most vulnerable people at risk’New Northern Ireland drinking laws bring industry ‘into ’ – all you need to know PremiumBenefits overpayments at highest level in years: reportCheers to that!

This got her through to the semi-finals, which she won, despite being the youngest of all the competitors.“She will now take part in the grand final on October  and is feeling pretty confident. I’d say she’s more excited than nervous. She absolutely loves singing and gets such a buzz from it.”Sophie also secured a place in the ‘elite team’ of a London-based musical theatre company Stage Box, which provides her with training in all aspects of stage work. Through the elite team, she managed to bag herself an audition for the West End musical Children of Eden, which celebrates its th anniversary this year and is based on the Book of Genesis. Sophie plays one of the children and has a singing solo piece in the show. Her training and rehearsals take place over holidays and weekends, meaning she can carry on with her school work.

My brother and nephew are musical too.“Sophie is really a great wee all-rounder but she’s also very kind and helps to look after her brother Connor, who is disabled.“We’re all very excited to see what she does next.”Sophie, who attends Fiona Flynn Performing Arts in Newry, added: “I love singing but I really enjoy acting too so I’d love to do both when I’m older.“I really admire the singer Ariana Grande but also my nanny and grandad who were both in a band. I’ve heard them sing and they’re very good. I’m not nervous at all about the Junior Eurovision Ireland final or the Children of Eden. I’m just super-duper excited.

With the furlough scheme set to end this week and a number of Covid- restrictions remaining in place, he argues until businesses can operate without restrictions the scheme should be retained. At the beginning of the pandemic in March , immediate thoughts turned to how businesses could stay afloat and how jobs and incomes could be protected. googletag.cmd.push The UK Government, to its credit, moved rapidly and put in place the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, better since known as the furlough scheme. As of this month, over . million workers across the UK have been furloughed at one time or the other, with the government supporting up to % of their wages in order to protect jobs and avoid widespread destitution. Sixty-six billion pounds has been spent by the Exchequer on the furlough scheme, a testament to the government’s commitment to protecting livelihoods and protecting businesses. However, the decision to wind down the scheme this month and remove the furlough safety net appears premature and may leave businesses and employees in the lurch. With coronavirus restrictions still in place in Northern Ireland, and no date set in stone yet for the removal of all remaining restrictions, businesses here are not operating with full freedom and full flexibility. If pandemic restrictions persist, then pandemic protections should also. Executive Ministers, including the First and Deputy First Ministers, have recently made confusing and contradictory comments about the future of the pandemic and restrictions in Northern Ireland. While the Economy Minister has shown an urgency and willingness to set a date for the lting of all remaining restrictions, the First Minister recently dampened these expectations while the Deputy First Minister refused to rule out future lockdowns or so-called ‘circuit breakers.’     The continued confusion and uncertainty over restrictions is bad for business, bad for employers, bad for workers, and bad for the wider economy. The last thing the business community needs after  long months is the threat and anxiety of another deeply damaging lockdown. Until we get to a stage where we can fully operate and live without restrictions, however, pandemic protections like the furlough scheme must remain in place. Other countries like Germany and the Republic of Ireland are extending their wage subsidy schemes well into . At a time when global finance and borrowing rates are extremely cheap for national governments, this is not the right point to be unwinding supports for businesses or workers.

In circumstances like this, cash is king, but when you continue to stockpile cash long after you’ve reached your emergency fund number, that’s when it begins to hurt you financially.Excess savings sitting in accounts earning negative s mean the purchasing power of those savings are going down in value, and whilst that may not hurt your finances much in the short term, it’s the opportunity lost in not investing in accounts that are producing much better s that will.The opportunity cost for one client of mine who had €, sitting in a deposit account, that had no reason to be there, was €, over just one year.         I had a zoom call with her back in February and she told me she had savings of c. €, sitting in a deposit account earning .%. But when you factor in DIRT tax and inflation, her actualwas -.%.Anyway, she knew she was cash heavy, but was unsure how much of the €, she should ide up and what number should be assigned to her emergency fund and what could be set aside for investment and so on.So, what I suggested to her was very similar to what is primarily used when it comes to pension planning in retirement, and it’s known as The Bucket Strategy. I thought the concept is such a great one, it should be adapted and used when it comes to iding up the amounts people have accumulated in cash.The solution is iding up the amount you have in savings into three dferent accounts, and the amount you deposit into each account is based on:*When you need the money*How long you want it to last for, and*How much you need or can set asideWhen we applied this logic, the strategy for her looked something like this:Bucket Number  – Emergency FundAccount Type: CashRisk: ZeroPurpose: Covers emergency expenses for  monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,We looked at what deficit would existthere was a loss of income, and we focused on the cost of funding those priority expenses that must be covered and paid. And we discovered that monthly cost was €,.We were happy that having  months of those expenses in an account dedicated for this eventuality was enough.So, she set up a separate account, called it her emergency fund and transferred €, into it. Next up was,Bucket Number  – Short Medium Term ExpensesAccount Type: Cash Fixed TermRisk: ZeroPurpose: Known, once off expenses, incurred in the next   monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,This is an account you set funds aside for large once off expenses you know you’re going to incur in the next  months.The women I met was planning on changing her car next year and whilst she didn’t know exactly what car she was going to buy, €, was a good number to ring fence from her savings.But rather than leaving this amount sitting in a deposit account, she moved it to a fixed notice account for  months, earning .%. It’s still a terriblebut at least it was  times better than leaving it where it was.Bucket Number  – InvestmentAccount Type: EquityRisk: MediumPurpose: Make money beat inflationOptimum Balance in Account: €,Now more than ever, you need to be invested in equity-based accounts, you just have to.We set up this type of account up for the woman I met back in February where she deposited €, into it. And theon the account since then, has been +.%. The same account had s of +.% over  year and +.% over  years.Contrast them to the .% she was making by holding excess savings in cash.It meant her €, was going down in value by € every year.But had she set aside €, a year ago in an equity account, it would have gone up by €,.And eventhe equity s dropped in value by c. % from what they made last year, they’d still be % more than what she’d getshe left her money languishing in a deposit account.Whatever way you want to present it, the dference is staggering, and the reason I said from the outset, why holding too much cash is bad for your finances.One of the long-term financial effects, Covid could leave on people, is a fear that something like this could happen again, so people begin to hoard money and whilst there isn’t anything wrong with that, it’s where they leave this money accrue that’s the problem. And that’s in cash accounts that are earning nothing.Let me repeat again, those accounts are fine for your emergency fund, but once you’ve past that amount, you really need to consider other accounts that will yield higher s.And perhaps not everyone will have enough in savings to fill three buckets.They may not have enough to fill even one, and that’s okay as well becauseyou follow this very simple strategy, it will prevent you from using money that’s being invested but should really be assigned to your emergency fund or leaving money in an emergency fund that should be set aside for investment.So, you really need to know your numbers and the dficulty I find with people, is that they have one, maybe two accounts and the amount they’ve accumulated is used for everything i.e. emergency fund, investment and once off expenses.And this is one of the reasons people are not optimising their finances. They may have spare cash that could be used towards investment, but it’s getting lumped in with emergency funds and once off expenses and it stays there and earns nothing.Having a dedicated amount for specic purposes makes things much easier because you know, you have the optimum amount in place for each purpose and you know you’re not affecting other areas, either.And using the Bucket Strategy will help. It’s not time consuming to set up, but I assure you, it will be time well spent.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

A legally binding commitment was made by Ireland to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by % by the end of the decade. According to a new sustainability study conducted by Empathy Research in June this year, % of businesses are doubtful theyll achieve these goals. googletag.cmd.push The study also found that % of companies claim they dont have science-based emissions targets, while a further % dont knowtheir targets are science-based or not. This is despite the fact that % of businesses believe their sustainability efforts have positively impacted their bottom line. Commenting on the studys findings, Head of Sustainability at EY, Stephen Prenille, said, Businesses have a very real responsibility to take charge of the role they can play in addressing the global climate change crisis. He continued: [They]need to proactively consider the cost-saving benefits of sustainable practices from the get-go and build them into financial planning. It doesn’t undermine sustainability efforts to draw a connection to long-term profitability, on the contrary, it supports its adoption and longevity.” Forty percent of respondents to the study said they will seek support in the next six to twelve months to help improve sustainability efforts.

A legally binding commitment was made by Ireland to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by % by the end of the decade. According to a new sustainability study conducted by Empathy Research in June this year, % of businesses are doubtful theyll achieve these goals. googletag.cmd.push The study also found that % of companies claim they dont have science-based emissions targets, while a further % dont knowtheir targets are science-based or not. This is despite the fact that % of businesses believe their sustainability efforts have positively impacted their bottom line. Commenting on the studys findings, Head of Sustainability at EY, Stephen Prenille, said, Businesses have a very real responsibility to take charge of the role they can play in addressing the global climate change crisis. He continued: [They]need to proactively consider the cost-saving benefits of sustainable practices from the get-go and build them into financial planning. It doesn’t undermine sustainability efforts to draw a connection to long-term profitability, on the contrary, it supports its adoption and longevity.” Forty percent of respondents to the study said they will seek support in the next six to twelve months to help improve sustainability efforts.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. googletag.cmd.push NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”      CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

The minke whale carcass has been decomposing since it was stranded at Balls Point, near Bellarena, on September . Correspondence issued by Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, and seen by Derry Now, said it is not feasible to move the carcass and that it will be left to decompose naturally. googletag.cmd.push Officials from my Department visited the site on  September to ascertain details about the animal, which I can confirm was a juvenile Minke whale, approximately .m in , he said. This information will be sent to the UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme which coordinates the investigation of whale, dolphin and propoise strandings around the UK. My officials have reported the incident to the Receiver of Wreck at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency who has responsibility for dealing with stranded cetaceans. However, it is not always feasible to remove animals of this size and when they are not located in areas frequented by the public or other health and safety considerations, they are often left in-situ to decompose naturally. Allowing this to happen will have ecological benefits to many species, he added. A Departmental notication tag has now been added to the carcass, meaning DAERA have deemed no further action is required. During this visit my officials met the landowner and provided advice in relation to stranded cetaceans. The landowner confirmed he intends to leave the carcass to decompose naturally, added Minister Poots.     This week, a local marine scientist told the County Derry Post the carcass would pose a health risk as it continued to decompose.

The motion, which had been tabled by Deputy Mayor Christopher Jackson of Sinn Feacutein, called on both the Council and the Department for Economy to establish working groups to research the proposal further. googletag.cmd.push Iceland successfully trialled a four-day week between  and  with a trial to come in place in the Republic of Ireland next January. The motion read: “This Council recognises that a lack of work le balance contributes to work related stress, low productivity and burnout amongst workers. “ accepts that there is a growing body of International evidence that shows that moving to a four-day working week, without a reduction in income, enhances productivity and happiness amongst workers.  acknowledges that companies such as Unilever and Microsoft have trialled the concept of a four-day working weekend found it had positive impacts both for business and workers “ calls on the Council and Department for Economy to establish working groups and pilot programmes that support employers to trial the concept of a four-day working week amongst their workforce.” Deputy Mayor Jackson in support of his motion said: “There are many countries right across the world that are exploring the adoption of a four-day working week. “A similar trial has been carried out in Iceland and its been described as a resounding success.     “Thats not surprising when you look at the vast swathes of research thats been carried out on the benefits of a four-day working week. Productivity is boosted, the health and well-being of employees is drastically improved as is job satisfaction. “When we look at this, we look at it in the context of that one hundred years ago, a seventy working hour week was the norm and weekends didnt exist. “I knowthats something trade unions had campaigned and worked for. “Today, trade unions are advocating on behalf of workers who are having dficulties in achieving a le-work balance. “Theres workers who are claiming that theyre over-worked and feel under-valued. “We can all acknowledge how the pandemic has almost overnight changed the working environment for most of us. “We believe theres an opportunity in front of us to look at changing our working patterns. “So as we emerge from the pandemic, we can seize that opportunity and try and support workers. “The research on this done in terms of Britain alone says that a four-day working week would bring about the same reduction in carbon emissions as removing .million cars off the road .” “Also, over  per cent of work absences are down to stress. If we can create the right environment for workers across the board, theres a possibility that we can create a more positive environment for people to be working in.” An amendment from Cllr Shaun Harkinwas tabled and passed unanimously. It read: “It has been almost  years since Trades Unions secured workers the right to a weekend. Therefore, Council will facilitate employers in the private, public and community sectors to work with trade unions on shaping four-day working week pilot programmes. Furthermore, Council agrees to work alongside Trades Unions and other relevant bodies, to bring forward a plan within twelve months to implement a trial under review within our own Council workforce, based on best international examples and practices where. “The Council agrees also that progress and implementation reports be presented to the Council on a quarterly basis, to support and inform any policies being progressed within the Department for Economy or other relevant bodies where.” Cllr Sean Mooneybacked Deputy Mayor Jacksons motion saying: “Since the pandemic, a lot of employees are working longer hours, probably finding it more dficult to switch off their laptops at the end of normal working hours. “This has led to complications with stress and burnout and probably a lack of productivity for both workers and employers. “The evidence that Ive seen from a study in New Zealand shows thatit brings a  per cent rise in productivity. Carbon emissions are brought down with one day less of commuting and a better le-work balance. “Employees can now spend more time with their personal le and allows employers to retain better recruitment practices. “A more notable aspect too is that national governments have decided to trial this. “Obviously, the downside is that this can only apply to certain sectors of the economy. Im thinking of the emergency services but with that said, we would certainly be supporting this motion.” There was a note of caution that a four-day week might not reach every worker in the country. Alderman Keith Kerrigansaid: “I dont wish to pour cold water on this but whatever is decided is grand, however, it will not work in the private sector. “Theres a lot of wee, small businesses with less than  employees or a lot of self-employed iniduals out there. “It would be very dficult for them to try and cut out that extra day when theres work there that has to be done. “This motion is grand for the larger firms and for the civil service but it will be very dficult to bring this in for the private sector.” Deputy Mayor Jacksons was voted on and passed unanimously. Of the result he said: “There is a growing body of international evidence showing that moving to a four-day working week, without a reduction in income, enhances productivity and happiness amongst workers. “It has already been trialled by major international companies who found that it had positive impacts both for business and workers. “Therefore I’m delighted that the council has passed my motion calling on the local authority and the Department for Economy to establish working groups and pilot programmes that support employers to trial the concept of a four-day working week amongst their workforce. “The pandemic and the working from home revolution has shown that major changes in the way we work are possible and that will bring massive benefits to workers and their families.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

Photo: Martin McKeown.Reporter: Staff Reporter Oct   addthis, There was great excitement in the Shantallow area as the long-awaited official opening of the new Shantallow Community Centre took place last week. The pound.m state of the art development replaces the former centre which served the community for over four decades on the same site. The project has been delivered by Derry City and Strabane District Council with poundm in funding from the Department for Communities through its Neighbourhood Renewal Investment Fund. googletag.cmd.push Speaking at the event, Alderman Warke acknowledged the signicant effort to deliver the project despite the challenges faced during the pandemic, and after many years of planning. He also praised community partners in the area for helping to shape the plans for the facility to meet the needs of local people. “This is a great day for the Shantallow area and one which has been much anticipated for a long time,” he declared. “Shantallow Community Centre has been at the heart of the community for decades, serving an array of s and serving as a base for many local organisations. “This new facility will become an even more important hub, accommodating a wide range of activities, and providing a modern and welcoming space for people of all ages in the area to enjoy. “Investment in local communities is vitally important, and I want to thank the Minister for continuing to support the provision of fit for purpose facilities, particularly in the most deprived areas. “This centre follows the delivery of a brand new community hub in Top of the Hill, and will soon be followed by a new hub in Galliagh, delivering vital services in community areas.     “I want to acknowledge the work of all involved in the delivery of this important capital project, as well as the support of our community partners throughout the process.” The original Shantallow Community Centre was first built in , with the expectation that it would serve the local community for ten years. It was home to numerous groups over the decades, hosting Irish dancing classes, youth discos, bingo, bowls and a whole host of social events, from dinner dances to luncheon clubs.  years later the pound, building was finally demolished in  to make way for the new state of the art centre which features a new sports hall, a multi-purpose room, staff changing facilities and fitness suite. Welcoming the opening, Councils Director of Health and Community Karen McFarland, said: I am delighted that we have reached this milestone today. This vibrant new facility will signicantly improve the community infrastructure in the Outer North Community Area, serving a wide range of needs and being utilised by people of all ages. “Its just one project within Councils wider Capital Development Programme which prioritises the transformation of local Community areas, as laid out in the City and Districts Local Strategic Growth Plans. “Thanks to Councils Capital Development team, the local community organisations and all who played a part in realising this vision for the Shantallow area.” Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said: “The provision of this funding through my Neighbourhood Renewal Programme, will be of great benefit to those who live in the local area. This poundm investment from the Department for Communities provides fantastic new facilities that will improve community based services and will help to improve the quality of le for local people for years to come. “This is one of several major investments that my department has made in the North West recently, including poundm for the Top of the Hill Community Centre. I thank all partners for their dedication and collaborative approach across the public and community sector. I am delighted to continue to deliver for the local community.” Cathal McCauley, manager of Shantallow Community Residents Association, who hold a Shared Management Agreement for the Centre with DCSDC, said: There has been a fantastic buzz in the community over the last year as local people could see the new building materialise. This new building now provides us with greater opportunities to deliver vital community services in an area which suffers from extreme levels of deprivation. “The local community are delighted with how brilliant it has turned out and would like to thank all those who helped us along the way other local community organisations, the Greater Shantallow Area Partnership  ONNP Growth Partnerships, Northside Dev Trust, Dept. for Communities N.W. Development Office, and Council. “The NWDO and Council officers have all been extremely helpful throughout the process. We also want to thank all our local political representatives who have supported us and this project over the past number of years.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Ciara Ferguson also welcomed the opening of the new Shantallow Community Centre. The Foyle MLA said: “I welcome the opening of the brand-new pound. million community centre in Shantallow. “This is the beginning of an exciting new chapter for Shantallow and the surrounding area as this facility will not only regenerate the area, but it will also deliver first-class services to residents. “I want to congratulate everyone who worked to make this development a reality and I look forward to working with the staff in the time ahead. “This is the latest in several major investments in community facilities in the city to improve the quality of le and improve community services.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication. Being part of the Volkswagen Group means that Cupra has access to cutting-edge mechanicals and technology, and this has enabled the new Formentor compact SUV to hit the ground running, so to speak.  googletag.cmd.push   There is a lot of money and confidence behind the Cupra brand, and that is evident in the bold product plan promised by the company.Engine  Trim OptionsThe Formentor sits on the familiar MQB set of chassis components that also underpins other crossovers such as the Seat Ateca and VW Tiguan. Petrol engine options in the Formentor consist of a .-litre TSI with bhp and a .-litre TSI unit with a choice of ,  or bhp. The . TSI engine is available as a -speed manual or -speed DSG , while the . TSI comes with a DSG transmission as standard, with Cupra’s Drivesystem standard in bhp guise. A . TDIEVO engine is available with bhp and can be mated to a -speed manual or -speed DSG transmission, with the latter coming with Drive as standard.     Additionally, a .-litre e-Hybrid powertrain is available with a choice of bhp or bhp, both of which are mated to a -speed DSG transmission with promised fuel consumption as low as .l km on a combined WLTP driving cycle.There is a choice of two trim levels in CUPRA’s new compact SUV — Formentor and Formentor VZ — with the latter being the Cupra Formentor’s most powerful trim, named in reference to the Spanish word ‘Veloz’, meaning ‘fast’.The Formentor VZ trim offers high-performance powertrain options. Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Oct Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Shamrock Rovers vs. Derry City Kick off pm Derry City are hoping to end a four year wait for a win over Shamrock Rovers when they visit Tallaght this evening. City have not beaten the Hoops since August , when goals from Aaron McEneff and Barry McNamee earned them a - win in Dublin. Since then, results have been miserable against the current champions, with City losing  of  games in that period. googletag.cmd.push That could well change this evening as City head to Tallaght full of confidence and in the middle of a seven-game unbeaten run in the league. Ruaidhri Higgins’ team have come from nowhere to insert themselves into a battle for European football next season, and three points tonight could take them level with Sligo Rovers in third place. The Candystripes are also full of goals at present, having scored eight in their last three games, with the three-prong strike force of Jamie McGonigle, Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe and James Akintunde each having scored in the past two games. It has been a good news week also for everyone involved with Derry City, with the club confirming that Dundalk’s Michael Duffy has signed a pre-contract agreement of four years to come back to the Brandywell. But all eyes are on matters on the pitch, starting with tonight’s game, with Higgins knowing just how important each league point is between now and the end of the season. “It won’t make or break our season that’s for sure, but Rovers are the best team in the land,” he said. “They are the benchmark for everybody to get to. It looks like they will be champions again and we know it’s going to be an extremely dficult task, but confidence is high and we’ll go there and give it a go.”     Higgins has watched his team push Rovers close twice this season a controversial equaliser denying City a win in the - draw at Tallaght in May, before Rovers overturned a - deficit to win - at the Brandywell in July. “Both games against Rovers that I’ve been involved in, there wasn’t an awful lot between the teams,” Higgins reflected. “Rovers’ quality and experience in the second half at the Brandywell was there for all to see and they blew us away in a –-minute period. We have improved from then and it will be a great test for our players. “Obviously we have huge respect for Rovers and the quality they have, but we’ll go there and do our best to win the game, as we do in every game. Our players are in good form as well so it should be a good game for both sets of fans.” Midfielder Joe Thomson sits out the final game of his three-game suspension, while winger Marc Walsh remains sidelined with a long-term injury.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

That winning mentality has seeped into the players ever since Donaghey’s arrival, and after six wins in seven games in all competitions, there is new le about a club which was on the floor just a month ago. googletag.cmd.push They are the form team in the Lough  Championship, with no other team managing four winning four of their last five league games and they are now expected to beat Knockbreda today and move even further up the table. That change in mindset is a challenge in itself according to Donaghey. “I challenged the players last week because for the Queens match, people thought they were favourites, probably for the first time, and I asked ‘How do you cope with this ’,” he admitted. “We started very, very poorly and it took us  minutes to get to grips with it. That will happen in the Championship I don’t think there’s a massive dference between bottom and second bottom, and top and second. Some of the results would prove that because the top teams are getting beaten by the bottom teams.” Donaghey admits he is surprised that results have improved so dramatically in such a short space of time, but puts the upturn in fortunes down to the players themselves. “If you were to say we would win six out of seven, I would have been surprised considering the fact that they lost their previous four and conceded  or  goals,” he said. “It has been a good turn round and it’s been down to the application of the players, giving them a wee bit of belief, and getting them enjoying their football again and giving them a bit of structure and getting them a wee bit more organized. The players take full credit for taking on everything we’ve asked of them.     “Working hard is a given. They are taking on board any information they are given which is good. It’s a thing you get with young players where they want to learn, and they have good learning capabilities, which is brilliant start for any manager or coach. “Getting the results also has given them that wee bit of belief. We’re embracing it, but we’re not getting ahead of ourselves.”  Brilliant Benny Benny McLaughlin was the hero again for ‘Stute last week, scoring yet another winning goal to take his tally for the season to six. He has been a massive factor in ‘Stute’s winning run. “Benny is a threat, and he will tell you in hindsight he should be sitting on double figures because he’s had quite a few chances,” Donaghey continued. “He’s a bit of a talisman at the moment, and even though his girl had a baby last week, he was the first one to say he would be there for the game.

Four defeats and even more injuries have given coach Richard McCarter plenty of headaches, and the club veteran admits he has never quite seen anything like this in his time at Judges Road. googletag.cmd.push “In terms of injuries and bad luck not really, no,” he admitted. “Anything that can go wrong has gone wrong in terms of injuries and we just haven’t really caught a break. There’s no point dwelling on that, we have to continue with what we’ve been given and keep trying our best under the circumstances. We have a bit of positivity on the injury front this week so we’re hoping we can get a stronger back line together and attack the game with more positivity.” It will be hard to shake the Ulster League losses of recent times, particularly the heavy home defeats to Bangor and Omagh. But McCarter believes they have to put that all behind them as they prepare for the bread and butter of the All-Ireland for the first time in  months. “We have probably gone through every emotion in the last four games in the Ulster League but evenwe had won all four all those, it sort of counts for the same because no-one judges you on your Ulster League results, it’s all about the All-Ireland,” he explained. “We just have to see this as a fresh start, draw a line under what’s happened and just be really positive this week. We’re away from home which is always dficult, but it means that we can go down there relatively pressure-free and just have a good crack at it and you just never know what can happenwe stay in the game and get off to a decent start.”     Changed times So much has changed since Derry’s last All-Ireland game, which was coincidentally against Tullamore back in February . That day at Judges Road, the home side came out as - winners, but that seems a dferent world to now, with new management, a new squad and new challenges. “It’s notoriously dficult to win away from home in the All-Ireland,” McCarter added. “That maybe concentrates us a bit better but regardless we have to go down there and see this as a fresh start. If we can get off to a good start and quiet the home crowd, they become jittery and our tails can go up, so it’s important we try to get off to a good start and maintain that. “It’s probably a fairly dferent team which will go out to the one which played them  months ago. We have got to be happy with the squad we’re taking down I have full confidence in those boys and see how we get on.” Given the circumstances, it would be impossible to predict how the season might go for City of Derry, and McCarter hasn’t even thought of setting a target, especially after coming through the last few weeks with plenty of collateral damage. “Genuinely I don’t have any targets,” he said. “We are just going to take every game as it comes I have learned in the last six weeks that anything can happen. I don’t want to put pressure on the players. We’ll focus on Tullamore this week then it’s about Enniscorthy next week.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

We’re away from home which is always dficult, but it means that we can go down there relatively pressure-free and just have a good crack at it and you just never know what can happenwe stay in the game and get off to a decent start.”     Changed times So much has changed since Derry’s last All-Ireland game, which was coincidentally against Tullamore back in February . That day at Judges Road, the home side came out as - winners, but that seems a dferent world to now, with new management, a new squad and new challenges. “It’s notoriously dficult to win away from home in the All-Ireland,” McCarter added. “That maybe concentrates us a bit better but regardless we have to go down there and see this as a fresh start. If we can get off to a good start and quiet the home crowd, they become jittery and our tails can go up, so it’s important we try to get off to a good start and maintain that. “It’s probably a fairly dferent team which will go out to the one which played them  months ago. We have got to be happy with the squad we’re taking down I have full confidence in those boys and see how we get on.” Given the circumstances, it would be impossible to predict how the season might go for City of Derry, and McCarter hasn’t even thought of setting a target, especially after coming through the last few weeks with plenty of collateral damage. “Genuinely I don’t have any targets,” he said. “We are just going to take every game as it comes I have learned in the last six weeks that anything can happen. I don’t want to put pressure on the players. We’ll focus on Tullamore this week then it’s about Enniscorthy next week.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

No Oil Paintings are a rowdy Americana four piece from Belfast. What am I doing writing about a Belfast band when all I do is slag them normally  They do have some good bands and even some great ones and besides most of the funding was gone before anyone  had filled their application. googletag.cmd.push Where was I  Their mix of folk instrumentation, four-part harmonies and high energy live shows serves to create their own brand of genre bending roots music. The band share and switch lead vocals with each member delivering their own style and strength to the songs they bring to the table. Expect to hear everything from swampy blues rock to straight up-country waltzes. What’d you do during the lockdown  “Most importantly we finished recording our debut album, but when we weren’t focused on that we just tried to keep creative. “We recorded live sessions, performed live streams, made ‘zoom videos’ and set each other writing challenges.” Have you got plans for normality, whatever that is, s  “Release the album out into the world. “ We’ve a few more singles to put out before releasing next year, so we’re concentrating on those and trying to book a tour to coincide with that.” Do you like any local musicians andso, who do you like  “We have loads of incredible friends that are part of the music scene here and there really is too much talent to choose from. We’re all fans of The Bonnevilles, Joshua Burnside, Joel Harkin, Laytha, Dani Larkin - The list could go on forever.”     Are there any valuable people, places, organisations to musicians anymore  “There is a huge lack of infrastructure within the music scene in the North, however the people that are here to help do a fantastic job of it. Help Musicians N.I helped fund a lot of the cost of our album through their ‘Do It Dferently’ fund. Places like the Oh Yeah Centre, The Nerve Centre, and how they influence the younger generations as well as nurture the more experienced performers is a credit to all of them. I think a lot of grass roots venues are incredible throughout the country, but we love The Sunflower Bar and The American they’ve always been good to us - and of course Half Bap Recording Studios where we recorded our album.” How was Stendhal, I’ve seen you there a couple of times now  “We’ve slowly made Stendhal a home from home for ourselves, so it’s always a dream to get up to the farm to play again. August  made it our th time performing in the last six years. We’ve made great friends and amazing memories over that time and will always be there for as long as they’ll have us.” Any misconceptions about the band that you’d like to clear up  “I think a lot of people still have us down as quite a bluegrass   folky band, and over the years we’ve had line-up changes and dferent sounds and styles. I think we’ve settled a lot more now into the Americana Alt-folk genre. “We keep very true to our roots and still write folk songs, but they come with a little more decibel now.” Is the oh yeah of any worth  “Absolutely, the work that Charlotte and the team are doing there is really admirable. We’ve been fortunate to play gigs for them on numerous occasions, most recently at last years ‘Sound of Music’ festival. “They have also helped promote us in the past with their ‘Getting To Know’ series and the ‘Native Music Mart’ they host each year. “Aside from ourselves the work they do with Scratch My Progress, Volume Control, Over The Hill and a long list of other”.Well, that’s me proved wrong. I probably owe them an apology So,the Oh Yeah is so good what’s wrong with Irish music scene  “I think the lack of infrastructure is our only downfall. There is an incredible amount of talent on this island, but we don’t have the private investment needed to be able to export it at the right volume. “Small things that people don’t think about such as tour managers, tour buses, right up to major labels and publishers. “We don’t even have representatives for PRS, MU or PPL.” You can find them at www.nooilpaintings and message them atinfo@nooilpaintings,listen to them at open.spoty artist DAlMAJRiFSuRMgdand soundcloud no-oil-paintings,stalk them at instagram no_oil_paintings and twitter nooilpaintingsand watch them atwww.youtube channel UCmxiPBRaPiDbbJiuA-aqA ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

No Oil Paintings are a rowdy Americana four piece from Belfast. What am I doing writing about a Belfast band when all I do is slag them normally  They do have some good bands and even some great ones and besides most of the funding was gone before anyone  had filled their application. googletag.cmd.push Where was I  Their mix of folk instrumentation, four-part harmonies and high energy live shows serves to create their own brand of genre bending roots music. The band share and switch lead vocals with each member delivering their own style and strength to the songs they bring to the table. Expect to hear everything from swampy blues rock to straight up-country waltzes. What’d you do during the lockdown  “Most importantly we finished recording our debut album, but when we weren’t focused on that we just tried to keep creative. “We recorded live sessions, performed live streams, made ‘zoom videos’ and set each other writing challenges.” Have you got plans for normality, whatever that is, s  “Release the album out into the world. “ We’ve a few more singles to put out before releasing next year, so we’re concentrating on those and trying to book a tour to coincide with that.” Do you like any local musicians andso, who do you like  “We have loads of incredible friends that are part of the music scene here and there really is too much talent to choose from. We’re all fans of The Bonnevilles, Joshua Burnside, Joel Harkin, Laytha, Dani Larkin - The list could go on forever.”     Are there any valuable people, places, organisations to musicians anymore  “There is a huge lack of infrastructure within the music scene in the North, however the people that are here to help do a fantastic job of it. Help Musicians N.I helped fund a lot of the cost of our album through their ‘Do It Dferently’ fund. Places like the Oh Yeah Centre, The Nerve Centre, and how they influence the younger generations as well as nurture the more experienced performers is a credit to all of them. I think a lot of grass roots venues are incredible throughout the country, but we love The Sunflower Bar and The American they’ve always been good to us - and of course Half Bap Recording Studios where we recorded our album.” How was Stendhal, I’ve seen you there a couple of times now  “We’ve slowly made Stendhal a home from home for ourselves, so it’s always a dream to get up to the farm to play again. August  made it our th time performing in the last six years. We’ve made great friends and amazing memories over that time and will always be there for as long as they’ll have us.” Any misconceptions about the band that you’d like to clear up  “I think a lot of people still have us down as quite a bluegrass   folky band, and over the years we’ve had line-up changes and dferent sounds and styles. I think we’ve settled a lot more now into the Americana Alt-folk genre. “We keep very true to our roots and still write folk songs, but they come with a little more decibel now.” Is the oh yeah of any worth  “Absolutely, the work that Charlotte and the team are doing there is really admirable. We’ve been fortunate to play gigs for them on numerous occasions, most recently at last years ‘Sound of Music’ festival. “They have also helped promote us in the past with their ‘Getting To Know’ series and the ‘Native Music Mart’ they host each year. “Aside from ourselves the work they do with Scratch My Progress, Volume Control, Over The Hill and a long list of other”.Well, that’s me proved wrong. I probably owe them an apology So,the Oh Yeah is so good what’s wrong with Irish music scene  “I think the lack of infrastructure is our only downfall. There is an incredible amount of talent on this island, but we don’t have the private investment needed to be able to export it at the right volume. “Small things that people don’t think about such as tour managers, tour buses, right up to major labels and publishers. “We don’t even have representatives for PRS, MU or PPL.” You can find them at www.nooilpaintings and message them atinfo@nooilpaintings,listen to them at open.spoty artist DAlMAJRiFSuRMgdand soundcloud no-oil-paintings,stalk them at instagram no_oil_paintings and twitter nooilpaintingsand watch them atwww.youtube channel UCmxiPBRaPiDbbJiuA-aqA ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

Dancer Helen Hall, poet and stand-up Alice McCullough and performance artist Sinead O’Donnell have created new shows that explore dferent aspects of the human condition. It is the first time that Bounce has taken place in the North West and all three are excited by the challenge of performing in Derry. googletag.cmd.push The shows, which have been commissioned by the University of Atypical, are free and open to the public but pre-booking is recommended. Dancer and choreographer Helen Hall will be performing her new show ‘Collecting Moments’ at the Nerve Centre on Friday, October  from -.pm. Helen, who has been visually impaired from birth, began dancing as a young child and says it helped her with spatial awareness and movement. Her new piece was inspired by a multi-media collaboration put on hold because of Covid-. It combined dance with music, visual art, video footage and photography. She ed to the studio in June, and it was this creative exchange between Helen and fellow artists Bronagh Broderick, Jamie Maison-Harper, Paul Moor, Vasiliki Strasinaki, Katie Richardson and George Sloan that led to her new show. She said: “Because I had collected all these beautul moments of sights and sounds, it had a real sense of joy, so they all found their way into this new piece, which I’m looking forward to sharing with the audience.” Alice McCullough’s new show, ‘Brave New Words’, is taking place at the Verbal Arts Centre on Saturday, October  from -pm. She will be supported by popular spoken word poet Abby Oliveira from Derry.     Alice, who is bi-polar, is an acclaimed performance poet and stand-up. Her show is a collection of poems, stories and spoken word, dealing with her condition, creativity, and the process of stepping back on stage for the first time since the Covid- outbreak. She said: “I called my new show Brave New Words because it has been such a dficult year and it is great to have the chance to begin performing again. It is my first solo show in Derry, and I can’t wait to perform at the Verbal Arts Centre.” Sinead O’Donnell is an internationally acclaimed performance and video artist, whose new live show Trigger takes place at the Nerve Centre on Saturday, October  from -pm. Over the past five months, Sineacutead has been experimenting with dferent creative approaches and processes, developing rich layers of thought channeled into actions that come together in this newly formed live performance. Sinead’s new video exhibition, Grounding and Flying Dreams will be on show at the Centre for Contemporary Art in Artillery Street from October -. It was developed from a series of explorations researching public space and how it informs and shapes ideas relating to feminine landscapes. She said “During the pandemic I found myself thinking: where can I make my work  and do I feel safe in public spaces making my work  At this time the rise in domestic violence being reported was hitting the media and the seriousness of this reality was becoming an everyday thought. I thought about a person, or family not feeling safe at home and how I could make work publicly in safety. So, questions of safety and the feminine body is an ongoing concept that informs my work.” All in-venue events will be subject to enhanced Covid- protocols and procedures to keep everyone safe.

While I donrsquot think this is a negative thing for my children, due to the volume of social groups and clubs that they participate in, I am now consciously taking opportunities to expose them to a wider iety of social situations, so they do not feel the potential effects of rural isolation.It is clear to see the effects of rural isolation when just recently at a meeting with Translink, the cutting of rural bus routes and services was brought to light. This is another slap in the face to those living in rural areas without access to their own vehicle, especially when considering the climate crisis.I and my fellow councillors and party colleagues are encouraging constituents to use active travel and public transport.Meanwhile, those exact services are being cut removing the option for active travel. This is not good enough.I have conducted a range of investigative meetings to see how groups and organisations within South Down in particular are taking action to prevent rural isolation.I recently met with Nicholas McCrickard, manager of Co Down Rural Community Network, an organisation crucial in combatting rural isolation in South Down as itrsquos an umbrella body set up and managed by community groups in the area for more than  years.The aim of the organisation is to create an inclusive future where all citizens actively participate in local le which stimulates a vibrant society.Nicholas and his team, with the support of community groups, ensure regular outreach to all of the citizens in the area so that they can enhance their own lives through participation with ious organisations. This stimulation is a sure-fire way to combat rural isolation, but the resources need to be available to ensure no one is left behind.I recently visited the offices of Good Morning Down in Downpatrick mdash another vital service many in our community rely on. It is an organisation which regularly makes telephone calls to those facing isolation for a iety of reasons. These calls are a method of friendship building between volunteers and residents of a wide iety of ages.The youngest volunteer in Good Morning Down is in their late s, while the eldest is in their late s. Nearly  years worth of knowledge and experience will be exchanged through these conversations and I walked away from this meeting, feeling truly touched by the dedication of the staff and volunteers.In addition, having met with Womenrsquos Aid in recent days, fresh in my mind are the stories of the impact that living in a rural setting has on many women who are isolated from much of society.Not having that friendly neighbour close by can impact the severity of abusive relationships. Thankfully, we have organisations such as Womenrsquos Aid who recognise this and work every day with women in these situations, but funding, resourcing and legislation is always an issue.These are only a few of the fantastic initiatives that offer support to those in rural communities, however, there are many who are unaware of their operation.I would like to raise awareness of the services available to our rural constituents, to promote inclusivity and encourage a positive approach to mental health and wellbeing. It is extremely important to raise awareness and encourage our rural communities to stop and think about their mental health and to consider how rural isolation may affect them.I would encourage our rural communities to take time out to improve their mental health, normalise discussion around issues of isolation and avail of local mental health services.It is time that Newry, Mourne and Down Council took responsibility and recognise the vital work local groups within our community do for the residents of our district and remember that ratepayers donrsquot just live in our major towns like Downpatrick, but also in rural areas such as the wider Lecale countryside.There needs to be a serious refocusing on service provision in rural areas and a renewed approach to capital investment. We need to stand up for the safety of our rural communities, and protect them from the effects of isolation. Rural communities cannot continue to be left behind..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29September2021-Horse.jpg","title":"Horse show fundraiser for Uganda  ","story":"THE organisers of Saintfield Horse Show handed over a cheque for pound, at a reception at Temple Golf and Country Club last Thursday evening.The money was raised at the show which was held at Danescroft Equestrian Centre, near Lisburn, on Saturday, August .Last year money raised from the horse show and the Saintfield Christmas Charity Ride provided a borehole for a village in Uganda, giving the community fresh, clean water.Show director Joan Cunningham said: ldquoNow wersquore committed to continue making a massive dference by providing a maize milling machine which will enable the farmers to process their crops for food.

number of regular starters set toin time for the next round, the Magpies will surely be a dreaded draw for anyone in the competition.Meanwhile, Aidan Robinsonrsquos Downpatrick dark horses made it two wins from two after defeating Longstone by eight points on Saturday.Downpatrick have made a resounding impact in this yearrsquos Senior Championship thus far after dispatching last yearrsquos runners-up Carryduff in their opener, before following that up with their latest scalp at the weekend.Longstone were entering the tie on a high after defeating Warrenpoint in the first round, who many had claimed would push Kilcoo all the way.Both of Downpatrickrsquos previous opponents, Carryduff and Longstone, will now meet in the third round of the competition where one will progress to the quarters and the other will see their championship title hopes shattered.Carryduff managed to bounce back from their opening round loss with a good win against newly promoted Saul.Last yearrsquos intermediate football champions could be excused for their back-to-back defeats in this seasonrsquos top flight campaign after they were drawn the vastly experienced Burren followed by the Carryduff side.However, Saul now enter the relegation battle and face the possibility of ing to the intermediate ranks that they fought so valiantly to climb out of last year.Joining them in the fight for survival will be Loughinisland who, similarly to their opening round, could not maintain their lead for the full duration of the match as they lost to Mayobridge.The Bridge now face Bredagh in their third round tie, after the Belfast side defeated Castlewellan in their opener but failed to beat Ballyholland to progress to the quarters.Castlewellan will be relieved that their one point victory over Rostrevor at the weekend kept their Championship dreams alive, but they will face stf opposition against Glenn in the qualying round.Also in the depths of relegation are Bryansford, who lost out to Glenn in their opener before they were defeated by Warrenpoint in the second round.In the intermediate action, Liatroim made it two consecutive wins to progress to the quarters after they defeated Darragh Cross by five points.The Cross will now meet Newry Shamrocks via the back door route with nothing other than a win requiredthey are to keep their promotion to the Senior Championship alive.Whereas it was a bitter pill to swallow for Dromara, Bright and St Johnrsquos who all tasted defeat for the second game in a row and now face the dreaded relegation battle.Despite Dromara losing to Saval in their second round, they will feel more disappointed at their opening performance where they should have secured the win over Clann na Banna after leading for long durations of the contest.Simarly, Bright will also be kicking themselves after they blew a nine point lead in their opener against Tullylish before they lost out to St Paulrsquos.St Johnrsquos also had their promotion hopes dashed in heartbreaking fashion after they lost their must-win game against Newry Shamrocks by just one point.In the Junior Championship, Kilclief ensured Teconnaught would remain in the competition for another year after a three point win progressed the red and green side to the next round.Teconnaught lost out to Aughlisnafin in their opener whilst this was Kilcliefrsquos first taste of championship action after they received a bye in the first round.Elsewhere, Ardglass bounced back from their opening round lost to Dundrum with a fantastic win over Aghaderg.All of the

demonstrated what he described as an ldquounfortunate increase in bigotry and said it is beyond him why ldquosomeone would be so stupid.The graffiti was daubed on a section of the Moneycarragh bridge mdash also known locally as Bennettrsquos bridge mdash with Cllr Lewis saying what happened was ldquoidiotic and void of reason and that defacing the historic bridge demonstrated ldquoovert sectarianism.Cllr Lewis said while police may not be able to identy those responsible, he was told that neighbours can.ldquoThe aspiring republican artists should be thoroughly embarrassed by their actions and I only hope that their parents are reading this article, he declared.ldquoThis part of rural South Down suffered heavily as a direct result of IRA terrorism.

Now is the time to step up and support them by making it local. I would strongly encourage people from within the district to avail of the voucher and shop locally.Downpatrick businessman Darren Kearney, who is the owner of Oakley Fayre, said the business is pleased to be open to near full capacity again, which has only been made possible with the support of staff and loyal customers.ldquoThis has been a dficult time for many industries and the hospitality industry has been hit very hard, so we welcome any incentive or investment scheme that will help bring people onto their local high street, he said.Mr Kearney added: ldquoSupporting local gives back to the small, family-run businesses that are the foundation of the Northern Ireland economy.Stormont Economy Minister Gordon Lyons is encouraging local businesses to support the initiative.He said the ldquounprecedented scheme, which closes on November , is designed to boost businesses across the retail, hospitality and service sectors following the impact of the Covid- pandemic.He is urging all businesses to show their support to help maximise the benefits of the Spend Local cards and to use them wisely, supporting the local economy and communities as a ldquolittle spend can have a big effect.Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said the scheme comes on the back of a very challenging period for retailers right across Northern Ireland.ldquoThe High Street Support Scheme is a welcome step in the long road to recovery for Northern Irelandrsquos retailers and I would encourage everyone in our industry to think hard about how they can encourage people to use their pound spend local card with their business, he said.ldquoIt should be remembered that p in every pound spent in an independent retailer is recycled around the local economy.

This would help ensure that the centre of Strangford does not become a car park which happens regularly.Cllr Enright thanked residents for their support on the traffic issue in Strangford and confirmed that the Stormont department has accepted the traffic tailbacks causes problems and that the issue needs to be addressed.He said officials have allocated a small budget to employ additional staff to ensure that the dedicated ferry queuing area is utilised at peak periods to reduce congestion in the centre of the village.Cllr Boyle agrees that a permanent solution is required to address the queuing issue in Strangford.He continued: ldquoWe must promote tourism to its fullest potential on both sides of Strangford Lough. That means that we need structures in place that maintain a steady flow of traffic through both Strangford and Portaferry.ldquoWe simply cannot continue with Strangford village regularly coming to a standstill, with residents being seriously affected, creating a negative rather than positive impact on local businesses and le in general due to ferry traffic.Cllr Boyle said Strangford and Portaferry had much to gain from tourism, provided there were proper structures in place to deal with vehicles wishing to board vessels on either side of the lough.He said he has discussed the problem with Cllr Enright and they believe there is a simple, cost-effective solution to addressing the problem.Cllr Boyle said it is important that visitors and tourists have a positive, not negative experience of both villages, confirming that both politicians plan to progress the issue with senior Department for Infrastructure officials.He said they also hope to contact with Stormont Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29September2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Wheelchair beach access plan  ","story":"THE possibility of trialling floating wheelchairs at beaches across the district is being considered by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The move comes after the local authority was asked to address the lack of access to beaches for those with mobility problems and officers asked to look at potential solutions.A number of politicians say they recognise the need to do more to ensure beaches can be accessed by a wide range of people by providing floating wheelchairs and special matting to allow them to travel over sand to make it to the water.The issue was discussed at last weekrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee with officers agreeing to bring back a report for discussion next month.Initially, officials will examine access to Newcastle beach before focusing on others across the district.Local councillors Patrick Brown and Alan Lewis are spearheading the drive to provide improved beach access, especially as there a number of local facilities which have been awarded prestigious blue flag status which recognises their quality.In a report presented to members of the council committee last week, officers said they were currently investigating several options and a further report will be tabled in October.She also issued a reminder of ongoing consultation on so-called changing places provision which is designed to meet the needs of people with a range of mobility issues.Cllr Harte said not everyone in a wheelchair was mobile and would need a hoist. Therefore there wouldnrsquot be much point providing floating wheelchairsthe council did not have the facilities for these people to get into or access these wheelchairs.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said that the beach access issue had been raised with him throughout the summer and he called for other beaches to be included in the pilot.He said his only concern with the motion would be thata pilot project was being proposed, the councilrsquos blue flag beaches at Tyrella and Cranfield should be considered.ldquoThe experience of wheelchair users to get on to the beach and enjoy that same thrill is a priority and we should be doing whatever we can to facilitate that, he said.ldquoThese floating wheelchairs can be taken into the water and allow people to enjoy the same experiences as everybody , things that are taken for granted.The motion to improve beach access was initially tabled in August and was inspired by the campaigning work of local activist, Naomi Herron, who approached all her local councillors askingsomething could be done to give her better access to the beach.At the time, Cllr Brown said he understood that while a small scale trial of the idea has operated in Cranfield in the past, it was important that this was expanded out into other parts of the district and that he could ldquothink of no better place than Newcastle given the large number of visitors it gets every year.He continued: ldquoAs a council, it is important that we ensure all facilities are open and accessible to all residents. It is right that we look at the issue of beach access, with a view to providing provisions for wheelchair-bound residents and visitors who wish to also enjoy our wonderful coastline.ldquo I donrsquot want this issue to go around in circles with reports, meetings and investigations. It is my hope that from this motion we see action, movement toward making the necessary access points needed to facilitate this initiative. Disabled beach access is a reality in other towns within these islands why not Newcastle.Cllr Lewis said work was needed to ensure the entire district is disabled access friendly, from changing to toilet facilities.He added: ldquoIncreased footfall to Newcastle during the good weather has brought many of these issues to the fore.

Part of the modern failure is because the Scots Irish blended so effortlessly into the dominant culture that they often became Americans, without a prefix, and their impact waned, whereas the much later Catholic Irish and Italians felt somewhat on the outside for the better part of a centuryand retained their European identity.Latterly this has changed markedly and now people of Catholic Irish descent are prominent everywhere, from the US Supreme Court to both the Biden and Trump presidencies.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...There is already a Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington DC but it must be neutral between unionists and nationalists. Unionist lobbyists would not be so constrainedIn living memory there was rarely more than one Catholic at any one time on America’s most powerful court of nine judges. Now they form a majority of the justices.The phrase Scots Irish was for a long time partly used as a code for saying non Catholic Irish.While the Ulster influence was large in the early United States, and massively so proportionate to the small population of Ulster itself, it was still under % of the population. The influence of German and English Protestants was much greater.You see this in early Belfast News Letters from the mid s, with ads for some boats sailing from Ulster to America, but reports of far larger numbers of departures from England and northern Europe But the millions of English and Germans were so dominant that they lost most of their European identity and became mainstream Americans. To a signicant extent the Scots Irish did too.Even so, unionist influence in shaping Washington’s view of Northern Ireland ought to be easily as great as that ofIrish America. In  I was on a trip to America with a number of journalists from both sides of the Irish border, only two of us from a northern Protestant background. We travelled to Kentucky and met Senator Mitch McConnell, already then one of the most powerful Republican Party politicians in the land . He asked us all where we were from, before telling us: “I’m from Banbridge.”Not only do many of these politicians have such Scots Irish roots, American conservatives generally have seen Britain as a trusted ally of the US for more than a century.On the other hand, Eirewas neutral in the war against Hitler, something that was remembered in the American corridors of power after .Few such US leaders think about Ireland in that way now, but they are aware that the UK has fought on the same side as America in recent conflicts such as the  Gulf War. Even Joe Biden, who unionists fear is anti British, strongly backed the UK in the  Falklands War .The UK and US often side together in the UN security council.This week the ex Ulster Unionist leader and submarine commander Steve Aiken wrote about the Aukus defence deal between Britain, America and Australia, and how it reflected a US understanding of the UK as a key security partner .Yet for all this shared history, unionist influence is negligible compared to Irish America.Not only have US congressional politicians scolded and threatened London over Brexit and any possible UK deviation from the Northern Ireland Protocol, they have — incredibly — scolded it on the legacy of the NI Troubles too.A nation that has been phobic about terror post September   is lecturing the UK for supposedly covering up its notably mild response to decades of IRA terrorism.Part of the failure to combat a Sinn Fein version of our past is rooted in a British Foreign Office mindset, that has little sympathy for Ulster Unionism and little inclination to defend it abroad.Part of the UK reticence in defending itself from American criticism of Brexit’s impact in Northern Ireland is rooted in its own paradoxical approach to the Irish Sea border .But much of the problem of unionist invisibility is due to the fact that there is a vast, well connected, strongly motivated Irish American caucus whereas unionism lacks the bandwidth to lobby in Washington.Recently we ran a letter from the Ireland Israel Alliance on how the Republic is now one of the west’s most anti Israel nations.Why do we not have British diplomats and unionist politicians hammering this home to pro-Israel America at every opportunity If a wealthy benefactor was to sponsor even two well-informed, permanent unionist lobbyists, they could make great headway in DC.One of the first things such lobbyists could do is make connections with the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committeelobby group and emphasise Irish hostility to Israel.There is so much  that unionist lobbyists could work on, above all building bridges with influential American conservatives.This is lobbying that the Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington could never do, being neutral between nationalists and unionists. Even that natural diplomat, Trevor Ringland, is restricted in his role as a part-time NI envoy to the US.Unionist lobbyists could, and would have to, go much further.• Ben Lowry: A belated happy th birthday to ourselves at the News Letter!• Ben Lowry is News Letter acting editor——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWhile not a great deal is known about the history of the village, there are signs of early occupation in the form of a Bronze Age flint tool and cooking mounds that have been discovered. The name of Bonvilston or Tresimwn dates back to the th century when the Norman lord Simon de Bonville was granted the manor by Robert Fitzhamon, Lord of Glamorgan and he constructed a ringwork castle as added protection for the castles at Dinas Powys and Sully.There are also references to monks being at Bonvilston and in a papal bull which is a public decree or charter issued by the Pope, a grange was mentioned in .When the parish became part of the Cottrell Estate, the last resident of Cottrell House was Mackintosh of Mackintosh from Moy in Scotland who was married to Lady Maud Cavendish. In  she donated the reading room for the male population of the village to learn to read, but it wasnrsquot until  that women were allowed in.At the end of the th century the Bassett family owned the estate and the family lived at Bonvilston House for more than  years. The house passed on through more famous names like Tudor Crawshay, the grandson of the well-known Ironmaster William Crawshay and then into the Brains brewery family. Although the house was demolished in  the lodge still remains.Gathering at Maes-y-Ffynon, which was built between  and  the group followed the bridleway at the far end of the road and walking between green hedges arrived at the busy lane which leads to Pendoylan. Crossing the lane and a stile a superb view opened out in front of them across a newly cropped field. Continuing downhill through a sheep-filled field and over the next stile they spotted two donkeys in the field, one of which looked very near to giving birth!At the bottom of the field a holly hedge was very carefully negotiated in order to enter a beautul garden belonging to Trehedyn House in the tiny hamlet of Tyrsquon y Pwll, said to be the birthplace of the Welsh hymn writer Thomas Williams, who later moved to Llantwit Major and in  built the Bethesda Chapel there.     Making their way through beautul meadows, they arrived at Lanlay Meadows in Peterston-super-Ely, which are owned by the National Trust. This quiet rural area has been farmed for centuries and the land is untouched by fertilisers, the hedges are left untrimmed, with its twisted oaks the area is rich in animal and plant le and forms part of the Ely Valley Site of Special Scientic Interest.A fairly rare plant Monkshood or Wolfsbane, which also has a number of other names, grows along the riverside and the whole plant, especially the root, is poisonous. The lovely orchard in the meadows provided the group with a great place to enjoy their morning refreshment in the increasingly warm sunshine, before backtracking slightly to follow a grassy path to the river which twists and turns its way along the northern edge of the meadows.Joining part of the Valeways Millennium Heritage Trail and following the river with its bends, nooks and crannies, an unmarked path led them through some rough, muddy ground. Then passing through fields whilst being preceded by a large herd of cattle, they exited just below the village of Pendoylan.Following a surprisingly busy road to re-enter fields on their journey to Caer Wigau Isaf, this th century Tudor manor house is Grade II listed and after a pause to admire the stunning stone and brick-work of the many buildings, they carried on through a small wooded area for the climb up to Lillypot Farm, where the fertile land was acquired by the Bonvillersquos in the th century.Climbing up through meadows they stopped for lunch at the base of their last climb whilst drinking in the stunning views across the Ely Valley. Then continuing their climb, at Lillypot Farm they were greeted by a lovely chestnut pony who was very friendly and eager to have his photo taken with them, before descending through fields near to the defensive ringwork of Y Gaer, an oval enclosure defended by a bank and ditch.Following a path bounded by gardens they arrived back at the extremely busy A to pass through the grounds of St Mary the Virgin Church, which dates from Norman times, but was rebuilt by the Victorians in  and only the tower and chancel arch remain of the original church, before ing to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
