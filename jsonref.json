Serious side effects with both the jab and nasal spray are extremely rare.HOW WILL MY CHILD BE VACCINATED AGAINST FLU?Most children will be vaccinated at school, but those who have not started yet, or who are in a high-risk group, can also get it from their GP.I\u0027M PREGNANT – IS IT SAFE TO GET THE COVID AND FLU JABS?Yes – both are safe for pregnant women, and it\u0027s important to have both if eligible. There are more risks for you and your pregnancy if you contract Covid-19 without the vaccine, and the flu vaccine will also help protect your unborn baby.If you catch flu when pregnant, you\u0027re at risk from complications such as bronchitis and it could cause your baby to be born prematurely, have a low birth weight and may even lead to stillbirth.If you are pregnant, you can get a free flu vaccine from your GP, pharmacist or through your maternity service.  ◼ To check your eligibility for the flu vaccine and Covid-19 booster vaccine or to find a service, visit nhs.ukwintervaccinations ■ This article is part of a paid-for partnership with the UK Government"},{"url":null,"title":"Biden pledges voting rights legislation priority","story":"Share this article The legislation being voted on Thursday in the House tries to claw back some of what its supporters consider executive overreach that has been building in the U.S. for years and intensified during Trump\u0027s term. It includes provisions to strengthen enforcement of congressional subpoenas, protect whistleblowers and provide for congressional oversight of presidential emergency declarations, among other provisions, many of them previously backed by Republicans.Rep.

This was the equivalent to 8 per cent of all infected patients who were admitted for treatment.For comparison, there were 393 infected patients in ICUs in the two weeks after Delta took off in the province, or 24 per cent. NICD figures showed that in the latest week — roughly a fortnight after the strain was first detected — there were 1,371 Covid-infected patients in the province\u0027s hospitals every day, on average.Some 103 of these were in intensive care facilities (eight per cent), and 30 were hooked up to ventilators (two per cent).For comparison, in the second week of the Delta wave there were 1,578 patients in hospital every day with 380 in the ICU (24 per cent) and 153 on ventilators (10 per cent).Overall hospital admissions in the province are tracking at the same speed now as during the Delta wave.But a much lower proportion involve serious disease where patients need to be treated in the ICU or hooked up to a ventilator.British experts said the promising data offered evidence that the variant could trigger a milder illness than other mutant strains. But experts point out it is still early days, and that it takes time for people infected with the virus to become ill enough to be admitted to hospital and develop severe disease. They add that more people having immunity from vaccines or previous infection in the country may also play a role. "},{"url":null,"title":"Fresh confusion bonkers new Plan B mask rules churches","story":"Share this article Masks do not need to be worn in hospitality settings, even if the person is not eating or drinking. And under Plan B people are being told to work from home if they can from next week, but Mr Johnson said it was still possible for Christmas parties to go ahead.And the guidance would not stop colleagues gathering at a pub to do their jobs.Officials confirmed there was nothing within the rules to stop colleagues meeting at a pub to work, with the focus being on reducing the transmission risk from the commute and within the workplace.It would be up to employers and employees to decide how to interpret the new guidance.But the advice is that if a worker does not need to go into the office, they should work from home, in order to slow the spread of the Omicron variant. The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said: \u0027Obviously, we have, sadly, been in this position before and employers and employee, by and large, have demonstrated that they\u0027re able to work together and come up with an agreement recognising both business need and also the needs of iniduals and personal life circumstances.\u0027It is also understood that church events in people\u0027s private homes do not require masks because they are not classified as \u0027public indoor venues\u0027, while masks would also not be needed for outdoor carol services. The Government has also confirmed that vaccination passports -

My impression of them is dazzling at times going forward, and with a soft spot at the back. You have to metaphorically flip them over first, but once you do you can just walk right through them – something Barça have done with casual ease, and almost never happens in the WSL. “Barça have full-backs who are high and wide, they all play one or two touch, have forwards who drop off to create space, and a keeper who isn’t afraid to come out of her box all the hallmarks of the modern game. I think this experience will be chastening for Arsenal, but I really hope they can channel this disappointment into continuing to grow the WSL and the women’s game in general. If this Barcelona is the future of women’s football, well, I can’t wait!” That last sentence is well worth repeating!Times are changing for the better.What a test this will be for Arsenal in front of a bumper crowd on a brisk, crisp December night. They’re up against the holders, of course, and know that a point would *guarantee* their presence in the knock-out stages. In reality it would take quite a turn of events for them to fall out out of the top two, with one game left after this and a six-point, 16-goal gap to third-placed Hoffenheim – but they can look upwards too, and could even put some serious heat on top spot with a win given Barca are three points ahead of them with a goal difference six better. However it pans out, what a fine occasion this should prove – and what a venue at which to watch two elite sides battle it out. Arsenal will be eager to cast aside their FA Cup final no-show against Chelsea and prove that they can trouble Europe’s elite when the going gets really spicy after Christmas – while Barcelona, who have comfortably outdone their men’s counterparts by the mere act of remaining in this competition, are ready to show they’re a class apart once again.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins Photos DublinA total of six confirmed cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 have now been identified in Ireland.The Department of Health has confirmed that five additional cases of the Omicron variant have been detected, bringing to six the total number of cases identified following whole genome sequencing.Meanwhile, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has on Thursday been notified of 4,022 confirmed cases of Covid-19. As of 8am, 530 Covid-19 patients were hospitalised, of which 115 were in ICU.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said: “There are now six confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in Ireland. A number of other probable cases are under investigation. “Although this is a new variant, our early understanding gives us confidence that a booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine will offer good protection against Omicron and Delta infection.”Dr Holohan said the current wave of disease continued to be driven by the Delta variant of Covid-19.“We know that the public health measures we are so familiar with will break the chains of transmission of Delta, and we are confident they will work on Omicron.“Please continue to layer up on the public health advice by getting vaccinated and boosted, reducing contacts, wearing masks, keeping distance, opening windows and cleaning hands regularly.”Dr Holohan said it was heartening to see large numbers of people attending walk-in vaccination centres on Thursday to receive their Covid-19 booster dose.“If you are eligible for a booster dose, then please do not wait until after Christmas to receive it. You will begin to receive the benefit of your booster protection within seven days of receiving your third dose. “This means that anybody who receives their booster vaccine this week or next can be confident in the protection the booster will offer as we move closer to the Christmas period.“If you are yet to receive a primary dose of Covid-19 vaccine, please make arrangements to do so. The HSE will be very happy to see you. If you have any concerns about receiving your Covid-19 vaccine, I encourage you to engage with the trusted health advice available on www.hse.ie, and with your own clinician.”Earlier, the HSE’s chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry had confirmed a second case of the Omicron variant had been detected in Ireland. Before that, Gisaid, an international consortium that tracks variants of Covid-19, had reported a second Omicron case here.The first case of the variant of concern, detected initially in South Africa, was identified in Ireland on December 1st. The Gisaid website earlier showed that one Omicron case was detected in Dublin and the other in Co Meath.The State’s National Virus Reference Laboratory, which tracks variants in the country, submitted an update on the variant to Gisaid on Wednesday.News of the second case was confirmed by Dr Henry following the HSE’s weekly briefing on Thursday afternoon.Dr Henry said at the briefing that the exact transmissibility of the Omicron variant remained unknown but it may have a growth advantage over other variants.He said there were forecasts that it could become the dominant variant in Europe by the start of January.There was “considerable uncertainty” around the new variant and it was “too early” to draw conclusions around the severity of the disease that it caused, he said. Dr Henry said he had “no doubt” that there would be further Omicron cases because the experience in South Africa had shown that this was “a highly transmissible variant.”There were “quite a number” of cases with a “marker” of the Omicron variant - the S-gene dropout - being investigated and sequenced by the National Virus Reference Laboratory.“I have no doubt that many of those will be confirmed as Omicron cases,” he said.Dr Henry told the HSE briefing that there were 1,500 cases a week being checked for the variant through genome sequencing, the process that identifies variants of the disease.This would be increased to 2,000 cases a week, above the recommended level to have a “comfort zone” on genome sequencing capability, he said. Also speaking at the briefing, HSE chief executive Paul Reid said he expected Omicron to become more dominant in Ireland and that the HSE was planning for this, but that it was still unknown when this would happen. “We expect it is only a matter of time before we are looking at significant numbers of cases of Omicron. We expect it to become more dominant. The timeframe is unknown,” he said. Mr Reid said the HSE was awaiting evidence on whether Omicron led to higher hospital admissions among people it infects and that would bring uncertainty to the health service during the Christmas period when case numbers were already at high levels. Mr Reid said that “no real assurance” could be taken from the low level of cases identified in Ireland, pointing to the surge in cases in the UK were Omicron cases nearly doubled in a day. The HSE urged people to get their third booster vaccine jabs with Mr Reid pointing to evidence from vaccine makers Pfizer and BioNTech this week that three doses of the vaccine increased a person’s protection against the Omicron variant 25-fold.

Video: Oireachtas TVThe queue outside the UCD vaccination centre on Thursday. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins PhotosThe Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the HSE have apologised after hundreds of people were turned away from over-subscribed vaccination clinics in Dublin on Thursday. Walk-in centres at University College Dublin (UCD), Croke Park and other sites were offering booster jabs on Thursday without appointments to those aged 50 to 69 and to healthcare workers.However, it became clear early in the morning that demand was greater than capacity. This forced the HSE to issue statements on social media advising others not to attend and staff to turn away people who had queued for long periods. “I would say there is some frustration in the queues,” said a spokeswoman for the Ireland East Hospital group, which is running the UCD vaccination centre. “There has been some anger put towards the vaccination staff, and it is unfortunate because they can only do their best.”She said that as early as 8.15am, just 15 minutes after doors opened, about 600 people were queuing for a system that could only cope with half of that number. One man who attended the UCD clinic said he had cycled 8km to the centre in Belfield only to be turned away. The UCD centre had just 10 vaccination units and the capacity to administer about 100 shots per hour. Staff administered a total of 383 doses as the clinic ran for an hour longer than planned.Different operating modelThe HSE apologised for the long delays at the UCD’s vaccination centre on Thursday, saying that it was running a “very different operating model” from the primary vaccination plan earlier in the year with boosters being given through multiple outlets.HSE chief executive Paul Reid said there has been “a high level of demand”, particularly at UCD, as boosters were being offered to people in their 50s for the first time. Damien McCallion, HSE national lead for vaccinations, said there were 22 walk-in clinics open across the country during the day and people could look at the HSE’s social media channels to see waiting times. This would allow them to choose to go to other vaccination centres or defer until another day, he said.“In terms of that queue in UCD, we don’t want people to have to not be able to get through that and we have to look at how we can maybe smarten that up or improve it,” he said, adding that the HSE planned to increase capacity to get more booster jabs completed.Taoiseach Micheál Martin said he was sorry for the inconvenience those turned away had faced, adding that the motivation behind the “mix-up” was to make vaccines as accessible as possible. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar also apologised for the inconvenience and issues with the booster rollout, saying: “There have been IT problems and teething problems, and we will get them right just like we got them right during the first period of the vaccine programme.”Top of the league“In the round, the third dose programme is going very well, over a million people in Ireland have received their third dose. I think we’re very close to the top of the league table in the European Union in terms of third doses,” he said.Mr Martin was again asked about his comments about an apparent lack of urgency when it came to the booster campaign, after earlier this week saying just 93.000 of 180,000 appointments had been attended last week. Mr Martin said his motivation was to encourage people to take the vaccine. “There was not the same sense of urgency. That does not mean that people were delaying. It was important to get the point across,” he said. “The important point is that the booster really enhances your protection not only against Delta but also against Omicron.Mr Martin refused to be drawn on how vaccinations will be rolled out to schools, saying the HSE was currently preparing a plan which would be communicated when finalised.

File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe The millionth Covid-19 booster or third vaccine jab was injected into an Irish arm this week, but the spotlight has been on no-shows for such appointments rather than the progress made.When Taoiseach Micheál Martin told the Dáil on Tuesday that only 93,000 people had shown up last week for 180,000 appointments for boosters and suggested there was not the “same urgency” for boosters as for the first doses of the Covid-19 vaccines, this resulted in a political pile-on on Martin. He was accused of unfairly blaming the public for the no-shows. Compounding the problem is the fact that there are many angry people out there in eligible groups who have been waiting anxiously for their boosters.The problem with the booster figures, like with so many things related to Covid-19 and the State’s response, is complicated. At the centre of it are technical issues in relation to the vaccination programme, where qualifying people can get booster doses through vaccination centres, GPs or pharmacies. Communications messNew HSE figures show that last week 93,000 boosters were administered through vaccination centres or other HSE channels, 70,000 through GPs and 25,000 at pharmacies. Problems emerge with how these three channels are tracked: the three different systems do not fully talk to each other.The HSE cannot see who cancels appointments at GPs and pharmacies. It also does not immediately know who receives boosters from GPs and pharmacies as it can take several days for booster vaccination records to land from GP surgeries and pharmacies.As a result, these people can subsequently get a text from the HSE calling them to another appointment or encouraging them to attend a GP or pharmacy for the booster. There have been numerous reports of people struggling to cancel appointments they are repeatedly called to.HSE chief operations officer Anne O’Connor has acknowledged the problem with “joining the dots” between the three different channels. All this has created a communications mess at a time when scientific evidence is pointing to the importance of getting booster doses to protect against the new Omicron variant.Another problem for the HSE is that some people have contracted Covid-19 since their second vaccine doses and so cannot get their booster dose for six months.Given that more than 300,000 people have been infected here since June, there is an unknown but possibly considerable number who cannot receive a booster yet, regardless of the number of times they are called for an appointment.The HSE has privately acknowledged this problem too and will be introducing a system where affected people can text back the word “Covid” to messages calling them to booster appointments. They would then not be offered an appointment for another six weeks, giving the HSE time to allow the two systems covering the vaccinated and infected lists to “talk to each other”. ReschedulingEven accounting for the technical problems and the eligibility criteria in relation to the required five-month gap since second doses and post-infection timing, the HSE has said that, for some people, there does not appear to be the same rush to get boosters as there was for primary doses.Those involved in the vaccination programme say some people are cancelling or even looking to reschedule booster appointments multiple times because the time given does not suit them.Take-up figures bear this out. Even though boosters have been available to some groups for several weeks, significant numbers of certain age cohorts still have not got their boosters.As of recent days, the numbers yet to received booster doses include 15 per cent of those aged 80 and over, 22 per cent of people in their 70s, and 28 per cent of healthcare workers. Fixing the system will be essential before the vaccination programme becomes even more complicated with the rollout of boosters to the 620,000 people in their 50s from today and first vaccine doses to 480,000 five- to 11-year-olds in the coming weeks.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"donegal town dealing with mica if it was in dublin this would already be fixed","story":"Moville, on Donegal’s Inishowen peninsula, is among the worst affected areas in the country for mica and for the students in Moville Community College, the subject is rarely far from their minds.

There’s no getting away from mica.”The presence of the mineral in construction blocks – which makes them crack and eventually crumble – has caused structural damage to an estimated 7,500 homes in counties Donegal and Mayo, as well as smaller numbers in other counties.Mica has impacted the entire community, says principal Anthony Doogan, and the school community is no different.At Moville Community College approximately 20 per cent of staff and 25 per cent of pupils – about 20 staff and 100 families – are living in “mica homes” even more have siblings and parents who are affected.“I have five siblings, and four of them are affected by mica,” says Ruddy.

I don’t know, really, if we are safe any longer.”Others tell a similar story. Special needs assistant Barry Moore’s home is crumbling his daughter was riding her bike around the house when “a lump of plaster fell off... it was near enough to scare her, and me.”“You’re lying at home at night and you hear the walls moving. It’s scary, to think you’re living in a place that is meant to be your safe place and you’re hearing the walls cracking.”Five of the special needs assistants – nearly half of the special needs staff – have mica homes, and so do some of the students they support. A hoist used by one child is attached to a crumbling mica wall, while foster parents have bought two mobile homes to house their children with complex needs.“They need routine, they need to know what happening... they’re going to be moved into two mobile homes behind their house and watch their house getting knocked down,” says Moore.In school, he says, you can “see the children who have mica, or whose houses have mica. They are, like their parents probably are, nearly obsessed with the fact they have mica.“As staff you’re trying to accommodate and support children... but they’re going home to houses that aren’t safe and that are causing them grief and stress.”Guidance counsellor Sineád McCarron’s home also has mica she warns of “what’s coming down the line... this is just going to explode, really, in terms of the amount of support the students need.”As principal, Doogan has significant concerns about the physical and mental health of students and staff – not least through heightened levels of anxiety – and about the impact on students’ attendance and life chances the effects, he estimates, will persist for the next five to 10 years.The anxiety of students and parents “is having an impact on their work rate and their effectiveness at their studies at school,” he says.“Every secondary school in the country”, he emphasises, has seen the effects of Covid “We’re at the beginning of this cycle for mica and in two years’ time, when there’s a large number of houses in this community which need to be demolished and rebuilt, there will be severe anxiety and perhaps worse felt by a lot of our students.”There is also “clear evidence” of an increase in absenteeism due to illness – “they’re living in draughty rooms, the rooms are colder, the rooms are causing them health issues that they wouldn’t ordinarily have” as well as students from mica homes who have left school altogether.Brother and sister Shaun and Aoife Noone describe how their home is “falling down”: “If I put my hand in the wall I could just pull away some of the side of the house,” says 17-year-old Shaun.They have moved out so that their home can be demolished and rebuilt. “I don’t really have a study room so that’s affecting my study, because I’m doing my Leaving Cert now, and it’s harder to focus and settle down and get work done,” he says.“I feel disadvantaged, it’s unfair that most people would stress or be anxious about exams but I’ve got the pressure of my house on top of that, so it’s a bit hard on the mind as well.”Aaron Price (13) and his family have also moved out. “It was a lot to handle trying to go to school and do homework and trying to empty the house.”The Government this week announced a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild mica homes in Donegal and Mayo, capped at €420,000 per home and with a sliding scale of rebuilding costs from €145 per sq ft for the first 1,000 sq ft to €110 for the next 1,000 and €100 thereafter.It has been criticised by the mica campaigners in Donegal as falling short. “Apparently a new scheme was decided but it’s stupid, apparently each square metre gets less money, that doesn’t make sense,” says Aaron.“We need 100 per cent, and I know we probably will never get that, but if it was in Dublin, this would already be fixed.“It’s not our fault, we spent a lot of money on building our house... why should we have to spend more and more money rebuilding our house?”The adults have done the figures each of those spoken to by The  is facing a shortfall of between €60,000 to €80,000. “If council houses are being built at the minute they are built on a rate of €150 a square metre,” says Moore. “What was being offered would work out essentially for our house at €127 a square metre, which would leave us paying €65,000 on top of what we would get.“My other half is a psychiatric nurse, we’re no millionaires, we’re working-class people and we live in an average size house in Donegal which is the average in the country for a one-off build, 2,500 sq ft.“If they had dropped the sliding scale part... 145 euro per square foot, that’s it, and then your rent and then your storage, I would say 90 per cent of people would have been happy and celebrating, but they put in a scale that doesn’t exist in any builder’s pricing.”“The cost to me right now is €79,000, and that’s just for the build,” says Ruddy. “My house is 2,600 sq ft... that gives a total of €315,000 of a grant. The builders have come back to me with €395,000.“I can’t borrow because I have a mica home... 100 per cent redress is so far from it, I don’t think I’m even getting 80 per cent redress.“My children are at the stage where I should be starting to save for their college. Am I going to build their house and deprive them of education? We’re facing these choices.”“People bought the material in good faith... yet they are being victimised to the extent of having to spend 40, 50, 60, €80,000, whereas other areas were given 100 per cent redress,” says Doogan.For him, it is about the value placed on people from this area, not least given that the school itself is still “nowhere near completion” 20 years after it opened. “We bailed out the banks for €64 billion, and they’re saying three or four billion is a huge amount of money, but it’s less than five per cent of what we gave to the banks.“The people up here paid their taxes to pay for the bank bailout, and people here, like me, paid their taxes to pay for the pyrite redress in Dublin and Leinster. People round here are saying, ‘is there a different law for us?’”McCarron, too, is clear: “How can we help people look after their wellbeing and instil value systems of fair justice when our own Government continues to let this happen?”“They’ve let us down,” says 15-year-old Aoife. “If this was happening in Dublin, I feel it would be a different story, because we’re that far away and we’re rural they say ‘ah, them Donegal ones, they live in big mansions, they can afford it’. We can’t. We need our houses fixed.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"storm barra 3 000 without electricity as esb crews restore power to thousands","story":"ESB crew removing and replacing a single phase transformer near Fassaroe, Co Wicklow, which was damaged during Storm Barra.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Department of Education decided to close schools in several counties over the last two days due to the threat posed by Storm Barra.We asked readers for their views on whether the decision was justified and how it affected them.This is an edited selection of your responses.‘Another example of the contempt that this Government treats parents with’Claire Walsh DublinThe late-night decision by the Department of Education to close schools in Dublin today is just another example of the contempt that this Government treats parents with. Much like the last-minute mask decision fiasco the Government takes no consideration of parents ability to choose what might be best for their children or give parents time to deal with the fallout from the decisions. I would hope that in future they could consider parents in their late-night decision making.‘Does the Department of Education have any cop-on at all?’Kieran O’Hare DublinA ham-fisted, behind-covering, one-size-fits-all decision that has greatly inconvenienced parents and deprived children of yet another day’s valuable learning. It was nothing more than a very windy day in south central Dublin on Tuesday. It was even less inclement on Wednesday. Does the Department of Education have any cop-on at all? Why not delegate the decision to school principals. They are on the ground and best placed to make a call on local conditions. What will prompt the next enforced closure? The wrong type of wind?‘This is just not acceptable’Shirley Dunne GalwayIn Galway city, Tuesday was a bit breezy Wednesday was calm and the sun was shining. There is absolutely no reason why schools in Galway city should have closed. We will have a long winter, and negative implications on our children’s education, if schools close every time there is an orange weather alert. We are both trying to work from home whilst our children are home from school, and the school did not roll out any online learning or send home any materials for the children to work on. This is just not acceptable, or sustainable long-term.I am a third-year student in NUI Galway doing exams. They were planned to be on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday but due to the college closure the Tuesday and Wednesday exams were postponed to Saturday and Sunday. This creates a very stressful period as they have been placed in the middle of other exams. I now have four exams in a row from Friday to Monday, also with exams on the following Wednesday and Thursday. Six exams in seven days is not ideal. Both Tuesday and Wednesday did not display any strong winds that would prevent such exams taking place. This is not the type of pressure my course colleagues and I want in the run up to Christmas.‘I’ve no back-up. The pandemic has taken away all my unpaid supports’S Riordan CorkI’m a separated mother of two small children working a four-day week. Working from home (WFH) has its benefits and generally I work a hybrid model mostly. However, when the preschools \u0026amp schools are closed and I’ve no back-up, I’m actually parenting from work at my kitchen table rather than working from home. And I have no back-up. The pandemic has taken away all my unpaid supports – mainly my elderly parents – and the housing crisis, resulting in ever increasing rents, keeps pushing me further and further away from the city where my friends and family live. I do not live long enough in one place to make lasting friendships with neighbours that I could approach for help. My childminder is wonderful, but I pay her €70full day when I earn €95 net. I borrow to work the school summer holidays, I cannot afford any unplanned or unexpected curveballs like these last two days of red weather alerts and school closures. And with end-of-year deadlines, calling in sick is not an option. My workload would only be waiting for my return. Furthermore, I worry about the lasting developmental damage this frequent ‘WFH’ is forcing upon my young children. Both have been sick a lot lately and I cannot send them to school with even a snivel anymore. When they are sick I can no longer take time off to mind them because I am now able to ‘WFH’. So the frequency of this scenario of me at the kitchen table on the laptop ignoring them has increased.When there are two parents, they can help one another, give each other a break. I on the other hand, cannot even go to the shop for milk without packing us all out the door! Lets not forget that we’ve had long runs of school closures in the very recent past in this pandemic. And, in isolation these two days of red weather alerts and school closures would be manageable. However, within the context of this pandemic, a housing crisis and only the beginning of a long winter, it feels like the last straw.‘At 11pm we got the email the creche would close’Mrunal Kotkunde Dublin 16I was okay and scheduled all meetings to next day as I have toddler at home and it was difficult to work with him around. On Tuesday, weather was not bad in Dublin 16 and I thought the decision to close schools and crèches were uncalled for. They should have access the severity and took the decision only on affected areas and not generalised the decision. We got an email from the creche that on Wednesday it would be be open but at 11pm at night got the email that it was closed due to Government decision. Weather was not bad at all, as I have seen much worse weather than these two days. Has the crèche refunded us two days’ fees?We have already had enough stress due to Covid-19.‘Probably the right decision at the time’Kevin Connolly CorkIn our area of east Cork, the storm, thankfully, didn’t hit us as hard as other parts of the county or other counties. The decision to close the schools for the second day proved to be unnecessary in our part of the county, but it was probably the right decision at the time, and was no doubt influenced by poorer conditions in the west of the county. The decision was made in good time, 5.30pm and it was flagged for a few hours before the official decision was made.There was strong wind here for a couple of days. Nothing to worry about, yet two children home from school. Complete nonsense. Children packed into Mcdonald’s yesterday, and packed into indoor play centre today. It was NOT dangerous to go out. Stupid decision.I’m astounded at why the schools were closed when they have had ample opportunity over the past two years to operate online. It reinforces that those accountable for education in our country are not of a proactive or progressive mindset and take the easy option. Very disappointing.‘Conditions were not dangerous’Dermot Maguire DublinI am at a loss to understand why the schools in Dublin were closed. Conditions were not dangerous, it was indeed cold, wet and miserable, but it was also the same in December when I went to school 35 years ago. However, we just went to school and got on with it. Children have missed more school over the past two years due to the pandemic, on top of already the ridiculous amount of holidays for teachers, course days, etc. Of course, the decision to close schools was the one decision over the past number of years that the teacher unions accepted without question. I fear for the education of our children and their mental health.I had not been advised by the preschool so on Tuesday I turned up to it and realised it was closed. I had hectic days trying to do basic things as I live alone with a toddler. The school closures have disrupted my days but finally it’s over.‘These decisions should not be taken lightly’John Lalor DublinThe weather didn’t seem severe enough to justify the closure, in Dublin at least. Children have missed some much school time with Covid closures that these decisions should not be taken lightly. Additionally, most working parents had to take two days’ annual leave or lose two days’ pay to mind their kids at short notice. Obviously this isn’t the case in the Department of Education but decision-makers should be mindful of the impact on private sector workers.‘I don’t get this need to blame schools for the weather’Anne Cassidy DublinI would not have sent my kids on Wednesday even if the Government had not closed schools. The weather warning finished at 7am. We leave the house at that time so I had already decided to do the safest thing for my children and work from home. I don’t get this need to blame schools for the weather or the Government and I’m happy to blame the Government for a lot. I’m not sure sure I’d want to be a principal having to deal with that last night, but as a parent kids’ safety overrides my inconvenience. Even if in your particular area it seemed fine we all travel to work think how much more dangerous it would have been with school traffic and fallen branches.‘Is this to be the new norm?’Paul Richardson BrayIreland is an island. Consequently, the weather is regularly wet and windy. In Bray today it is merely breezy and a status yellow warning has been applied. But somehow the local environs are deemed unsafe for school commutes. If navigating your way past fallen leaves and the occasional puddle is challenging, then the decision to close schools for a second day was indeed a wise one. If on the other hand, you consider the inclement weather to be a regular feature of life in this country, then the school closures are perplexing to say the least. Is this to be the new norm – school closures on the basis of oft-cited, but rarely challenged, health and safety concerns?‘We don’t have a family to help in Ireland’Jonas Rall DublinIn Dún Laoghaire, Dublin, the storm was mild, with only leaves and bins being affected. My son, that is two years old, goes to a creche that closed Tuesday and Wednesday, with such short notice that I couldn’t make any arrangements. We don’t have a family to help in Ireland. This put massive stress over my partner and me to take the day off on Tuesday, move meetings and customers to the following days, only to be warned at 11pm on Tuesday that Wednesday would also have the creche closed. I found it unfair as I can see that the storm is not affecting my region, and I pay a hefty amount to the creche to help me take care of him so we can work. Moreover, it was clear in the note that the orange warning was only up to 7 am, with the first employees arriving close to 8.30am, they could definitely work on Wednesday.

Photograph: Jonathan PorterPress EyePA WireStormont officials are scenario-planning further Covid-19 restrictions that may be needed when, as expected, the Omicron variant becomes dominant in Northern Ireland early next year.First Minister Paul Givan said it was prudent for the Executive to prepare for the impact of the new coronavirus strain as he expressed concern at the rapid rate at which it is spreading in parts of Britain, where case numbers are doubling every two to three days.Executive Ministers were meeting on Thursday to discuss potential options, although Mr Givan and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill expressed hope that no further restrictions would be required before Christmas.The deaths of a further four patients who had previously tested positive for Covid-19 were confirmed in Northern Ireland on Thursday. Another 1,819 cases of the virus were also notified.On Thursday morning, there were 338 Covid-positive patients in hospital, of whom 38 were in intensive care.Stormont’s leaders were commenting as they visited Lagan Valley Hospital, where Mr Givan received his Covid-19 booster jab at Lisburn Primary and Community Care Centre.Northern Ireland’s booster programme has now opened up to people aged 40-49 who had their second dose of a vaccine less than six months ago.Mr Givan, who is in that new cohort, stressed the importance of ramping up booster rates to bolster the population’s immunity ahead of the inevitable spread of Omicron in the region.The DUP Minister said Northern Ireland was “behind the curve” when compared with the case numbers being recorded in England and Scotland and should be able to “get through the next number of weeks” before the new variant becomes dominant.“We don’t need to be panicking but we do need to recognise that what we are being advised is that this new variant is going to become a challenge for us in Northern Ireland early in the new year and we need to be ready for that,” he said.“So preparation is taking place. That’s what some of the discussion will be at the Executive today, so that we have all of this thought through in terms of what may be necessary.“That’s why I’ve said ‘don’t panic’ but we, as leaders of the Executive, need to make sure that proper preparedness is in place and we look at a range of scenarios, and obviously we hope that we don’t need to be doing anything whenever it comes to further restrictions that are being in place but it is prudent for us to be considering these things.”The Sinn Féin vice-president said it was likely Omicron would interrupt lives.“We want to avoid introducing restrictions, we want to keep people open and safe,” she said.“We want to take the pressure off the health service but, ultimately, I think it’s inevitable that at some point the Omicron variant is going to cause difficulties for our health service, but also economically because I think it is going to interrupt lives if it spreads in the way in which it potentially can, and the evidence shows from elsewhere that it will spread rapidly.“So that will have an impact in terms of services, I would imagine.“But we’re working to try to avoid introducing restrictions. We don’t want to be in that space. But we do think that by early in the new year this strain will be the dominant strain.”The leaders of the powersharing administration also stressed the need to address poor enforcement of Covid-19 rules in Northern Ireland.Public concerns have been expressed at the lack of action being taken to ensure compliance with rules such as mask-wearing. – PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"government approves committee to investigate international surrogacy","story":"     The Government will provide the committee with a ‘detailed options paper to inform its consideration of the matter’A new special committee will be set up in the new year to examine international surrogacy and will be given three months to complete its work.The Oireachtas Committee on Dáil Reform has agreed to establish the joint committee to consider the options for international surrogacy and a potential legal framework.Minister for Justice Helen McEntee wrote to the Government chief whip Jack Chambers on Wednesday informing him that the Taoiseach and other Ministers had agreed to the establishment of the committee.She said that given the significant and important nature of the issue, a consensus should be established about the path forward.“Following a meeting with relevant Ministers and the Taoiseach yesterday, it is intended to propose the establishment of a special joint Oireachtas committee on international surrogacy which would consider the issue.”The Government will now provide the committee with a “detailed options paper to inform its consideration of the matter”."},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics fresh restrictions breed frustration","story":"We assess the political fallout from the decisions taken over the past few weeks to introduce new Covid-19 restrictions covering international travel, masking children in primary school and the hospitality sector.

Photograph:  AP PhotoDenis FarrellCovid cases in South Africa have surged by 255 per cent in the past seven days but there is mounting anecdotal evidence that infections with the Omicron variant are provoking milder symptoms than in previous waves.According to a South African private healthcare provider, the recent rise in infections – which includes the Omicron and Delta variants – has been accompanied by a much smaller increase in admissions to intensive care beds, echoing an earlier report from the country’s National Institute for Communicable Disease.On Thursday, Marco Cavaleri, the head of biological threats to health and vaccines strategy at the European Medicines Agency, said the situation in Europe remained “extremely worrying”, primarily due to the spread of the Delta variant, while preliminary data on Omicron suggested it may be more transmissible than Delta but cases appeared to be mostly mild.“However we need to gather more evidence to determine whether the spectrum of disease severity caused by Omicron is different to that of all the variants that have been circulating so far,” Mr Cavaleri said. “Only time will tell.” Precise pictureHe said it appeared that the currently approved Covid vaccines were considerably less effective in neutralising Omicron, but “we need to gather a more precise picture around the level of immunity that can be retained”.The World Health Organization said Africa currently accounted for 46 per cent of reported Omicron cases globally.South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has said that despite the global concern over Omicron, it was still unclear whether it was more transmissible or caused more severe disease, and he criticised western countries for imposing a travel ban on the country.South Africa’s biggest private healthcare provider, Netcare, said data from its facilities indicated less severe Covid symptoms in the current fourth wave than in previous waves.“Having personally seen many of our patients across our Gauteng hospitals, their symptoms are far milder than anything we experienced during the first three waves,” Netcare’s Richard Friedland told the Daily Maverick on Wednesday.“Approximately 90 per cent of Covid-19 patients currently in our hospitals require no form of oxygen therapy and are considered incidental cases. If this trend continues it would appear that, with a few exceptions of those requiring tertiary care, the fourth wave can be adequately treated at a primary care level.”Previous wavesMr Friedland said that in previous waves 26 per cent of Netcare’s Covid patients were treated in high care and intensive care units.Mr Friedland’s comments echo earlier analysis from Dr Fareed Abdullah, of the South African Medical Research Council, who said many of the patients diagnosed with Covid in hospitals in badly hit Gauteng province and elsewhere were often “incidental” identifications in patients presenting with other conditions.“The main observation that we have made over the last two weeks is that the majority of patients in the Covid wards have not been oxygen dependent. Sars-CoV-2 has been an incidental finding in patients that were admitted to the hospital for another medical, surgical or obstetric reason,” Dr Abdullah said.“A snapshot of 42 patients in the ward on December 2nd reveals that 29 (70 per cent) are not oxygen dependent. These patients are saturating well on room air and do not present with any respiratory symptoms. A significant early finding in this analysis is the much shorter average length of stay of 2.8 days for patients admitted to the Covid wards over the last two weeks, compared to an average length of stay of 8.5 days for the past 18 months.” Younger populationSouth African and other experts have said it is still too early in the Omicron outbreak to determine the longer-term course of the illness, and the younger population profile of South Africa means other countries may not necessarily see the same public health outcomes.South Africa has struggled at times with initially distinguishing between Covid variants, with some testing equipment unable to quickly spot Omicron without sequencing. – Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"conservatives are panicking but they are unlikely to abandon chaotic captain","story":"British prime minister Boris Johnson has apologised after ITV uncovered a video showing his staff laughing and joking about a gathering in Downing Street during a Covid-19 lockdown in 2020.

Anger over Johnson’s mishandling of the Downing Street party story fused with libertarian Conservatives’ outrage over the restrictions.You’ve reached an article that is only available to  subscribers.Subscribe today and get the full picture for just €1 for the first month."},{"url":null,"title":"watch kamala harris became incredible disappearing vice president","story":"Kamala Harris made history as the first woman, first Black American and first Asian-American to become vice president. But after less than a year in the post, she is a historically unpopular vice president, according to The \u0027s Washington Editor Rozina Sabur. As seen in the video above, where Ms Harris was once always in the frame during Joe Biden\u0027s major addresses, she\u0027s been notably absent from the president\u0027s side of late. “For now at least, it seems she is no longer Joe Biden\u0027s heir apparent,” says Rozina Sabur.“A number of Democrats seem prepared to challenge her for the nomination should Biden not seek re-election in 2024.”More from NewsBrexiteer Gisela Stuart to oversee senior civil servant appointmentsMandatory Covid vaccines \u0026#39unethical\u0026#39 and \u0026#39impractical\u0026#39, says Sajid JavidVladimir Putin\u0026#39s goal is to \u0026#39destroy Ukraine\u0026#39 and lack of EU action may encourage himGermany\u0026#39s Siemens drops HS2 legal challenge to target £500m signalling contractBrexit fish wars could escalate after UK says France will not get all remaining 104 licencesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bird flu six pelicans removed royal parks precaution","story":"Bird lovers have been urged to regularly clean feeders in their garden to avoid infection from the UK’s worst outbreak of deadly avian flu. Around half a million birds have already been culled in the UK during the latest outbreak of H5N1, which mainly affects ducks, geese and swans. The outbreak is the worst that the UK has experienced, with 40 cases across the country, believed to have been spread by migratory wild birds from Russia and eastern Europe. All kept birds, including pets and farm animals, have been ordered to be held indoors to avoid infection since late November. Earlier this week, pelicans were seen being transported from St James’s Royal Park in London to Duck Island, a nature reserve in the park, as a precaution. While there have been no cases of human infection from the virus in the UK, it has a mortality rate of around 50 per cent in other countries where people have been infected. Humans can become infected by touching infected birds, or their droppings, including killing or preparing infected poultry. People with bird feeders in their garden have been urged to regularly clean them and to space them out to avoid the spread of the disease. A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said: “Everyone should take care to maintain good hygiene when feeding garden birds, regularly cleaning feeders outside with mild disinfectant, removing old bird food, spacing out feeders as much as possible, and washing your hands.”The spokesman added they were not calling on people to stop feeding their garden birds, as the disease was mainly affecting larger species.But people have been advised not to approach dead or dying birds, even if they appear to be in distress. Avian flu can cause birds to stumble around, their necks to twist, and their heads to swell.It causes a similar reaction to other influenza viruses in humans, and has caused dozens of cases, mostly in Asia. Christine Middlemiss, Britain\u0027s chief vet, told the BBC that the disease was at a “phenomenal level” that has “huge human, animal and trade implications”.She added that biosecurity measures would need to continue for some time, because the migratory period for birds would continue until March.Professor David Heymann, a former bird flu expert at the World Health Organisation, said people should take precautions around ducks and wild birds. He stopped short of saying that parents and children should wear PPE but said: “You should let children feed ducks or birds but you have to take certain precautions. “If the children are wearing boots they shouldn\u0027t wear them in the house and you should clean everything.”He said the risk of humans catching avian influenza was low and mainly came from close contact with bodily fluid.An outbreak of H5N1 in Hong Kong in 1997 infected 17 people, five of whom died. “It came to live animal markets and then it got into chickens. When humans took chickens home and butchered them they became infected. This was not casual contact but blood or other close contact,” said Prof Heymann. Dr Holly Shelton, an expert in animal influenza at the Pirbright Institute in Woking, said it was hard to “pin down a reason for the number of outbreaks this year”.“This year\u0027s outbreaks have been the most extensive ever, to date we have had 40 outbreaks in the UK, compared to last year\u0027s 26 outbreaks,” said Dr Shelton.Genetic sequencing of samples from this year\u0027s outbreak shows that it differs to previous viruses in “multiple parts of the virus genome”, she said, adding: “Examination of the sequences gives no alarm bells for an increased risk to human infection.“It could be that this current constellation of genetic alterations has conferred an advantage to the virus in terms of the amount that is shed by an infected bird, which in turn increases the likelihood of transmission to other birds.”More from NewsBrexiteer Gisela Stuart to oversee senior civil servant appointmentsMandatory Covid vaccines \u0026#39unethical\u0026#39 and \u0026#39impractical\u0026#39, says Sajid JavidVladimir Putin\u0026#39s goal is to \u0026#39destroy Ukraine\u0026#39 and lack of EU action may encourage himGermany\u0026#39s Siemens drops HS2 legal challenge to target £500m signalling contractBrexit fish wars could escalate after UK says France will not get all remaining 104 licencesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government has broken side bargain","story":"How many deaths would there be in an omicron wave? 50,000, perhaps?

The Royal Navy’s frigates and vessels from the US and Netherlands navies departed in recent days.On Wednesday, the helicopters and F-35 jets of 820 Naval Air Squadron and 617 Squadron departed the aircraft carrier for the final time, returning to their respective units of RNAS Culdrose, Cornwall, and RAF Marham, Norfolk.The service personnel from nine ships, a submarine, five air squadrons and a company of Royal Marines will arrive home in time for Christmas.Families and friends gathered in Portsmouth to meet their loved ones.For 25 crew members it was the first time they had met their babies, who were born while they were away.Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, said: “Today we pay tribute to the 3,700 personnel in the Carrier Strike Group that have been our global ambassadors on this historic and ground-breaking deployment.“The personnel and their families have made considerable sacrifices to make this deployment the success it has been. We thank them for all their efforts in strengthening our relationships with our allies and partners around the world.”Over the course of the deployment, the embarked aircraft of F-35 jets and helicopters clocked up 4,723 flying hours.The Air Wing consisted of British F-35 jets from 617 (The Dambusters) Squadron based at RAF Marham, Wildcat helicopters from RNAS Yeovilton and Merlin helicopters from RNAS Culdrose. There were also 10 US Marine Corps F-35 jets embarked on the carrier.Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, Chief of the Defence Staff, said: “Throughout the past seven months, HMS Queen Elizabeth and her Strike Group have been furthering the UK’s interests and strengthening our partnerships around the globe.“With involvement from across the Armed Forces, and our allies integrated throughout, this deployment has been a truly joint, truly international endeavour, which represents the very best of Global Britain.”The Carrier Strike Group sailed across three oceans and five seas, cumulatively covering around 500,000 nautical miles.In June, a diplomatic row flared up between London and Moscow when HMS Defender transited within 12 miles of the Crimean shoreline.Russia, riled by the presence of Nato navies in the Black Sea, said it had been a “provocation” for the British warship to sail in what it sees as its territorial waters.Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014 in a move that has not been recognised internationally.In September, China accused Britain of “evil intentions” after HMS Richmond sailed through the Taiwan Strait in what the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said was a “freedom of navigation” operation.The 110-mile wide strategic passageway between China and Taiwan is considered internationally to be high seas and is not subject to sovereign claims or jurisdiction.However, Beijing, which claims the island of 24 million as its own territory, regularly condemns United States warships for making “provocative” transits.Speaking at the time, Adm Radakin said the Taiwan Strait was clearly “part of the free and open Indo-Pacific,” adding that “it is a waterway that can be used by different nations”.One F-35 jet was lost in the Mediterranean Sea after a catastrophic fault developed on takeoff from HMS Queen Elizabeth. The pilot safely ejected.The wreckage was recovered this week, broken in “significant large parts,” the MoD said, after a multinational operation involving the US and Italian navies and commercial salvage vessels.More from NewsBrexiteer Gisela Stuart to oversee senior civil servant appointmentsMandatory Covid vaccines \u0026#39unethical\u0026#39 and \u0026#39impractical\u0026#39, says Sajid JavidVladimir Putin\u0026#39s goal is to \u0026#39destroy Ukraine\u0026#39 and lack of EU action may encourage himGermany\u0026#39s Siemens drops HS2 legal challenge to target £500m signalling contractBrexit fish wars could escalate after UK says France will not get all remaining 104 licencesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"schools send pupils home early christmas amid covid disruption","story":"The Education Secretary warned on Thursday that school attendance remains mandatory as headteachers started to send entire year groups home early for Christmas. Nadhim Zahawi told The : Schools will not be closing early and our updated guidance ensures face-to-face education continues.School attendance remains mandatory. We have taken action to protect education. The evidence is clear that the best place for children is in a classroom.But the UK\u0027s largest teacher union revealed that schools have already started to send whole year groups home to receive remote tuition because of a rise in teachers who are isolating.Some schools have closed down for a few days as a circuit breaker, while others have sent hundreds of children home until the start of the new term in January.On Wednesday evening, Boris Johnson said children should not be taken out of school before the end of term and nativity plays should go ahead.He told a Downing Street press conference: We don\u0027t want children to be taken out of school before the end of term, not that there is very long to go now. We don\u0027t want nativity plays to be cancelled.Kevin Courtney, the NEU\u0027s joint general secretary, told The : We are hearing there are schools where the number of staff who are having to isolate because they have tested positive is increasing and the schools cannot find supply staff.There are some schools that have had to close for some year groups because they haven\u0027t got the staff, and others worrying about when this will happen to them.Officials at the Department for Education (DfE) insisted on Thursday that face-to-face education should continue and that school attendance remains mandatory. They said schools will not be closing early as a result of the omicron Covid variant and Plan B restrictions.But several schools around the country have started to shut their doors and instruct children to learn remotely for a period of time.Arlecdon Primary School, in Cumbria, announced on Thursday that it would be closing for a five-day circuit breaker following advice from local public health officials.Kingswood Secondary Academy in Corby, Northamptonshire, sent two year groups home until the start of next term because of staff shortages due to illnesses. In a letter to parents, Michelle Newman, the school principal, said all pupils in years seven and eight should remain at home and would receive remote education until the Christmas holidays.Todholm Primary School, in Paisley, Renfrewshire, is also closed due to the impact of self-isolation on school staff numbers. It is due to reopen on Monday after five days of remote learning.Pinner High School, in north London, has sent several children home to self-isolate after they were identified as close contacts of a suspected omicron case.Croydon Council, in south London, has written to headteachers to strongly recommend that all Christmas carol services and performances should be cancelled unless they take place outdoors, and that year group bubbles should be reintroduced.Rachel Flowers, Croydon\u0027s director of public health, told teachers on Dec 1 that the measures were necessary because we are seeing cases rise markedly in school-age children. Headteachers have been told to revisit outbreak plans and ensure contingency plans are up to date so they are prepared for any future changes.Ofsted inspections will not go ahead in the final week of term to ensure schools and colleges in England can plan for omicron contingency measures, the DfE said.Meanwhile, Oxford University told students there had been a significant rise in the omicron variant and has asked them to get a PCR test at a walk-in mobile testing unit in the city and take daily lateral flow tests while they await their result.Any students who plan to leave the city should take two lateral flow tests three days apart and report their results to the university.More from NewsBrexiteer Gisela Stuart to oversee senior civil servant appointmentsMandatory Covid vaccines \u0026#39unethical\u0026#39 and \u0026#39impractical\u0026#39, says Sajid JavidVladimir Putin\u0026#39s goal is to \u0026#39destroy Ukraine\u0026#39 and lack of EU action may encourage himGermany\u0026#39s Siemens drops HS2 legal challenge to target £500m signalling contractBrexit fish wars could escalate after UK says France will not get all remaining 104 licencesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid plan b explained what","story":"Covid Plan B explained: What you can and cant do under new rules for EnglandBoris Johnson tonight announced England’s Plan B for Covid as the Omicron iant surges.

Experts warned cases of the new strain are doubling in just . to three days - up from seven days for the Delta iant.People are urged to work from home from Monday, must wear face masks in more settings from Friday, produce the NHS Covid pass at big events from next Wednesday, and may get daily contact testing instead of isolation.It’s what the PM hoped not to do. He hoped he would not have to review restrictions until next week in time for their expiry on December .Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the change “has made the virus an even more formidable foe” and although there are only  confirmed Omicron cases in the UK, “we know the actual number of infections will be signicantly higher.”Mr Javid said the UK Health Security Agency estimates the number of infections “are approximately  times” those currently known - so closer to ,.  England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty added: “We know that it looked asit was going to evade vaccination. And now, clinically, we know that it can.” Yet Mr Javid was booed in the Commons as he introduced the work-from-home order - which has left Tory MPs furious. Tory MP William Wragg said vaccine passports “will create a segregated society” - and accused the PM of a dead cat to distract from the No party. “Very few will be convinced by this ersionary tactic”, he swiped. So what can and can’t you do  Here’s the full rundown of new rules. Mandatory vaccine passports for venues Under Plan B, certain venues will be forced to ask punters for an NHS Covid pass. Under previous plans only the vaccine part would be valid. People would no longer be able to show a negative test.But today Boris Johnson announced he is putting this plan into action from am on Wednesday  December - with a key change.Contrary to previous plans, he said “a negative lateral flow test will also be sufficient” to get you into a nightclub evenyou aren’t double-jabbed.  People who haven’t had the boosterwill still be eligible for now - but Mr Johnson said “we will keep this under review as the boosters roll out.” It’s thought venues affected will be all nightclubs, and other venues open after am with alcohol, music, and dancing. They also include:Indoor, crowded settings with  or more attendees where those attendees are likely to be in close proximity to people from other households, such as music venues or large receptions. Outdoor, crowded settings with , or more attendees where those attendees are likely to be in close proximity to people from other households, such as outdoor festivals. Any settings with , or more attendees, such as large sports and music stadia. Working from home Under plan B the government “would consider asking people to work from homethey can, for a limited period”, according to the September document. Today Boris Johnson announced that policy. He said: “We will reintroduce the guidance to work from home. “From Monday you should work from homeyou can. Go to workyou must but work from homeyou can.” The winter plan admitted: The Government recognises this causes more disruption and has greater immediate costs to the economy and some businesses than the other Plan B interventions.” But SAGE had warned it would be a key way of getting cases down. Mandatory face masks  Face masks have already been mandatory by law in England’s shops, supermarkets, gt shops, indoor shopping centres, public transport including taxis and indoor stations, banks and post offices since am on November . They are also compulsory at hair salons, barbers, nail salons, massage centres, tattoo and piercing studios. And theyaposre needed during driving tests and lessons - plus at pharmacies, vets, auction houses, retail galleries, takeaways , estate and lettings agents, high street solicitors and accountants. Tonight Boris Johnson announced they will be extended to “most public indoor venues including theatres and cinemas” too from .am this Friday. There will be exemptions for eating, drinking, exercising, and singing. For that reason, hospitality venues - including pubs and restaurants - will be completely exempt. Those who do not comply can be fined £ for a first offence , doubling on each repeat offence up to £,. Police will be expected to enforce the rules. Daily contact testing New rules say any contact of a suspected Omicron case must isolate for  days. But that could cause a pingdemiccases surge to a million in total by the end of the month, as Sajid Javid warned they could. Therefore Boris Johnson said the government will introduce daily tests for contacts instead of isolation. He did not say when. Face masks in schools At the end of November, secondary schools in England were recommended to ask pupils to wear masks in communal areas and corridors. There are reports of talks ongoing about whether to extend this. However there was no immediate announcement. New foreign travel rules Since November , all arrivals in the UK from anywhere in the world have had to take a paid-for PCR test within  hours of their arrival - and isolate until the result comes back negative. Since yesterdaythey have also had to take another pre-departure test before they board their flight back to the UK. Previously, vaccinated travellers only had to take a lateral flow Day  test, and did not have to isolate. The new rules apply even to the double-jabbed. Arrivals who land without having booked a Day  test in advance can be fined £, on the spot. Eleven countries were also added to England’s red list, forcing all arrivals into hotel quarantine costing £, a head for  nights. They include South Africa, Zimbabwe and Nigeria. Boris Johnson did not announce any extension to this tonight. ‘Clear communications’ This is where Plan B gets vaguer. The Winter Plan said the government would ensure it “communicates clearly and urgently to the public that the level of risk has increased, and with it the need to behave more cautiously.” Boris Johnson today gave some of that messaging as ministers warned of the rapid doubling time of the virus. When will Plan B end  The measures announced today will be reviewed on January  and the government will update Parliament. Regulations will then “sunset” on January , Sajid Javid told MPs. But both of these days could be brought forward or pushed back so they’re not actually massively relevant. Don’t forget the original lockdown was only for three weeks. We can glean some information from the criteria for triggering Plan B in the first place. Key questions the government would ask include:Is the NHS in danger of being overwhelmed This crucially isn’t just about cases - hospitalisations and deaths are more important. Key metrics include “hospital occupancy for COVID- and non-COVID- patients, intensive care unitcapacity, admissions in vaccinated iniduals, and the rate of growth of admissions.The link between hospitalisation and infections: The winter plan says the Government is monitoring the ratio of cases to hospitalisations and also the proportion of admissions due to infections among other factors. It also states ministers are keeping an eye on how many people over -years-old are catching Covid- or ending up in hospital.Vaccine efficacy and immunity: A major booster campaign for the over-s and the most vulnerable started in September, but there are some calls for it to be stepped up. Crucial will be whether immunity across the population is waning, or whether it’s being kept strong by the booster programme.The impact of new iants: In recent months the threat of a new, more deadly or more infectious iant appears to have faded. But that doesn’t mean it won’t emerge in future months, and the government now has a sequencing infrastructure that will attempt to spot them as they appear.Could it go further  Yes. Boris Johnson has refused to rule out lockdown measures at Christmas - or, as some scientists fear is more likely, in January when Omicron surges. Some have warned the Plan B measures above are pretty minimal overall. In particular,cases rise too high, you might need much stricter measures to actually bring cases down, rather than keep them stable or rising more slowly. The Plan B document in September said: “While the Government expects that, with strong engagement from the public and businesses, these contingency measures should be sufficient to reverse a resurgence in autumn or winter, the nature of the virus means it is not possible to give guarantees. “The Government remains committed to taking whatever action is necessary to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed but more harmful economic and social restrictions would only be considered as a last resort.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DeltaConservative PartyNHSPlan BBoris JohnsonEducationHospitalsPublic transportShopping centresSecondary schoolThe economyPoliticsChristmas shoppingChristmas party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In the following year, all three received an indefinite leave to remain, and a year after this, they received their British Citizenship. With this, I also automatically gained citizenship through my parents - and of course, I was born here - so for all intents and purposes, I was and am British. Growing up in North London, I went to school in Barnet and then went on to secondary school nearby as well. Ultimately, I graduated from University of London while working multiple jobs throughout my university years. I then started my career as a journalist and hoped to make a change because the industry lacked British south Asians, and coverage around the community has been predominantly negative. There are around six million people like me, with similar stories of being born and brought up here, working in the UK and classing themselves as British Pakistani - which, despite having Pakistani at the end of it, does not make the aposBritishapos part of it any less credible - surely  Although at times it feels as though we are unwanted, this country is where we entered the world and is what we know. Evenwe decide to visit our home countries to gain more of a connection with our cultures, at the end of the day we are British citizens, right  But as much as we try to cling on to being British Pakistani or British Bangladeshi, British anything, the second part of the title has become a tool to ensure we know that we are in fact second-class citizens. This is because even though I was born here, I can be deprived of my citizenshipI am able to become a national of another country - for me, I could be deported to Pakistan on the governmentaposs whim. Despite being born and brought up here, clause , proposed by Priti Patel in July and updated last month, would allow for the Home Office to deprive me of my citizenship without delivering physical notication.This means,I went abroad and the government was unable to contact me, before boarding a plane back I could be told my passport is no longer valid without any warning.Mohammed Tasnime Akunjee, the lawyer known for representing Shamima Begum, explained how the new clause impacts Brits like me. He said: The existing law is thatthe Home Secretary deems you not conducive to the public good, and wish to strip you of citizenship, they have to sent you a notice of their decision with a reason for why they are stripping you of citizenship. However, now with the new clause, they donapost have to tell you, youaposll only be told when you try board a plane and your passport is no longer al. The government has said those who are deprived of their citizenship without notice have the right to appeal, but Mr Akunjee says there are issues with this.  He said: You need a physical notice in order to appeal a decision -you donapost have that then the courts will demand that you prove that you have actually have been stripped. You have to acquire that proof and be able to submit that to the court before you can even appeal. Additionally, although some might think that being born here would put you less at risk of being deprived of your status, Mr Akunjee says from a legal perspective, it does not. He said: Both peoplecan be stripped of their citizenship, being born or not born here doesnapost make a dference in respect of this bill. According to , the Home Office has said: “British citizenship is a privilege, not a right. Deprivation of citizenship on conducive grounds is rightly reserved for those who pose a threat to the UK or whose conduct involves very high harm. The Nationality and Borders Bill will amend the law so citizenship can be deprived where it is not practicable to give notice, for example,there is no way of communicating with the person.” So this means that as long as I am a good immigrant, I can stay in the UK  ButI was white, as I would be less likely to be able to get another nationality I would be more likely to keep my British citizenship regardless of what threat I pose to the public. *A version of this piece originally appeared on MyLondon Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Priti PatelHome OfficePoliticsShamima Begum\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Met Police has ruled out an official investigation into alleged breaches of Covid rules, but the PM has asked Cabinet Secretary Simon Case to establish the facts. Leaked footage of staff, including the PMaposs former spokeswoman Allegra Stratton, joking about cheese and wine at the bash and definitely no social distancing, however, sparked fresh public anger about the get-together. Ms Stratton resigned on Wednesday after the video emerged. Meanwhile, the Conservatives are battling to hang on to power in a crunch by-election in North Shropshire after Owen Paterson quit over repeated and egregious breaches of lobbying rules. The scandal led to numerous allegations of Tory sleaze, with a string of MPs found to have lucrative second jobs as political consultants. Mr Johnson was also forced to U-turn on his bid to rip up standards rules. The Government could also be facing a backbench Tory rebellion over the PMaposs new plan B restrictions in Parliament next week.

You are all very carefully socially distanced... we have moved, I am pleased to tell you, from the metric back to the imperial system: I notice you are all at least two inches away from each other which is, as I understand it, what the regulations require. No aide Allegra Stratton resigned yesterday over a leaked video showing Downing Street staff laughing and joking about how to describe the controversial event to journalists. The footage, obtained by ITV, was said to have been filmed the week after the party took place on  December.Mr Johnson finally apologised unreservedly for the party - after the Government repeatedly denied the Mirroraposs report that an event had occurred while the country was under strict Covid curbs. But the PM continued to deny all responsibility and say he had been told rules were followed. Downing Street aide Ed Oldfield, who took part in the mock press conference with Ms Stratton, refused to answer questions on Wednesday when doorstepped by journalists. Labouraposs Thangam Debbonaire accused Mr Rees-Mogg of treating the row as a bit of a joke - and asked why Ms Stratton was being asked to walk the plank. The Shadow Commons leader said: Judging by his comments as I saw on a video at a dinner earlier this week, it does rather seem that he also thinks it has all been a bit of a joke. After British people followed the rules and made their sacrices... yes the PMaposs staff laughed about covering up their Christmas party but he also seems to think that itaposs funny. She demanded to know why Mr Rees-Mogg didnapost follow Ms Strattonaposs example. Ms Debbonaire said: Would he also agree that it really is a very bad look indeed for a group of male politicians to let a female staffer take the rap for the mess   She laughed, he laughed. Sheaposs apologised and resigned. Whataposs he going to do  Mr Rees-Mogg said the Cabinet Secretary had been tasked with investigating alleged events in Downing Street last year - and defended his joke. He replied: As regards what I said at the IEA , what I was saying was how nice it was to be free of restrictions so that we can have parties this year. That was what I was being pleased about, as opposed, in comparison to last year. And this has got better because of what the Government has done. He also paid tribute to Ms Stratton and said she has left with great dignity. Labour MP Richard Burgon said: The Prime Ministeraposs former spokesperson has resigned after being caught on video laughing and joking about a rule-breaking Downing Street party. The Leader of the House also this week has been caught on video laughing and joking about rule-breaking whilst giving a speech at a lectern. She resigned. Surely the Leader of the House should resign too, or isnapost it another case of ministers in this Government believing itaposs one rule for them and another rule for everyone   Mr Rees-Mogg replied: Iaposm not sure heaposd like to come to the Institute of Economic Affairs, it talks too much sense for him possibly to be able to cope with it. But heaposd be very welcome to come to their future events and see what goes on and how nice it is, which I was celebrating, that weaposre back together having parties without restrictions. That is something that is extremely welcome.

The Health Secretary said “I hope not” to introduce even more rules to crack down on the surge of the more transmissible iant. But he was unable to give a guarantee. It comes after he smashed his own previous review date for restrictions and brought in two sets of rules less than a fortnight apart.People in England are urged to work from home from Monday, must wear face masks in cinemas and theatres from Friday, and must produce the NHS Covid pass at big events from next Wednesday.Face masks were already required in shops and on public transport and there were new rules on inbound travellers to the UK. Read More All the measures will now be reviewed on January , meaning they will be in place over Christmas. But scientists have raised doubts over what will happen after the New Year.SAGE member Prof Neil Ferguson said yesterday, before the launch of Plan B: “At the moment itaposs very dficult to rule out anything we really havenapost got a good enough handle on the threat.If the consensus is itaposs highly likely that the NHS is going to be overwhelmed then it will be for the Government to decide what it wants to do about that but itaposs a dficult situation to be in of course. Itcertainly might be possible at the current time. SAGE papers released last night warned the number of hospitalisations from Omicron may reach “, per day or higher” in England by January . It is currently just over . SAGE added: “The peak is highly likely to be higher than , to , Omicron hospital admissions per day without intervention.” Prof Paul Hunter, epidemiologist at the University of East Anglia, said he was pessimistic the strategy would work to curb infections. Advice to the government has warned cases of the new strain are doubling in just . to three days - up from seven days for the Delta iant.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the change “has made the virus an even more formidable foe” and although there are only  confirmed Omicron cases in the UK, “we know the actual number of infections will be signicantly higher.”Mr Javid said the UK Health Security Agency estimates the number of infections “are approximately  times” those currently known - so closer to ,. Asked by Sky NewsEngland was looking at more restrictions in January, Mr Javid replied: “No - I hope not.” He added: “I think the action we’ve taken now is very decisive, I think it’s going to make a big dference it’s not something anyone would do lightly. “It will have a real impact on people, be dficult for many people. But I hope people would understand it’s better to take this action now than see the rate spread and increase.” The Health Secretary said modelling indicated there could be one million UK Omicron cases by the turn of the new yearrestrictions were not re-introduced.Mr Javid said the deployment of Plan B was to buy time to assess the new coronavirus iant and to build our protective defences. NHS Providers chief Chris Hopson - who represents hospital bosses - told ITV ’s Peston: “Weaposre now looking at months - three, four, five months - where weaposre under really, really relentless pressure right the way across the piece.“And thataposs as you were saying with about , hospitalised Covid patients. “Clearlywe see those numbers signicantly increase, one problem is that itaposs potentially going to be in early to mid January which is the point at which the NHS is always under greatest pressure. “And we know also weaposve got massive, massive workforce pressures at the moment, in terms of weaposve got a very very tired workforce.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DeltaConservative PartyNHSUniversity of East AngliaNew YearPlan BPaul HunterHospitalsPublic transportPoliticsChristmas shoppingChristmas partyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Boris Johnson last night announced plans to replace the requirement - brought in on November  - with daily lateral flow tests.Now it is believed the government is aiming to bring in the change before the Christmas break. Further details of the policy and timings are due to be set out in the coming days. The timing will come as a relief to families who feared a fresh pingdemic of isolation ruining Christmas gatherings. Expert advisors to the government have suggested there could be a million Omicron iant cases in total in the UK by January .  People will be asked to take at-home lateral flow tests and report their results truthfully themselves, as now. It comes after the PM announced the introduction of Covid plan B measures, which include working from homepossible and wearing masks in more public places. From Friday, masks will be mandatory in most indoor public places including cinemas and theatres. People will be told to work from homethey can from Monday, and from December  spectators will have to offer proof of vaccination or a negative test to attend large events. An expected review of restrictions next week will no longer happen - as the PM rushed to announce plan B measures last night. Some critics have raised questions about the timing of the move, which came as he faced intense pressure over allegations of rule-breaking parties in Downing Street. All the domestic restrictions for England will now be reviewed on January , with a sunset clause on January . Travel testing rules - which say arrivals must take a pre-departure test and get a PCR test on arrival - will still be reviewed by January . The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said Boris Johnson would not hesitate to remove measuresthe data showed the situation had improved. He said: The PMaposs message to all MPs would be the very moment we get any information on characteristics that change that picture for the better then we would, of course, act and remove at the very earliest possible opportunity.

The further damaging details emerged as Labour urged police to open an investigation into allegations No  staff broke coronavirus rules with a Christmas party in Downing Street last year, saying it was “implausible” for Scotland Yard to suggest there is insufficient evidence.Itaposs understood the event was held by Mr Baileyaposs campaign team, who were working in the basement at the time. A Tory spokesman said: “Senior CCHQstaff became aware of an unauthorised social gathering in the basement of Matthew Parker Street organised by the Bailey campaign on the evening of December . “Formal disciplinary action was taken against the four CCHQ staff who were seconded to the Bailey campaign”. As the Prime Minister announced Plan B restrictions to slow the spread of Omicron, he confirmed a Whitehall probe would be held into a party held on December , and any evidence of rule-breaking would be available to any police investigation. The Whitehall probe will focus on the bash at which officials had drinks, nibbles and party games, including a Secret Santa, late into the night. The PM on Wednesday finally apologised unreservedly over a No Christmas party - but denied all responsibility, continued to claim he was told rules were followed, and threw his own staff under the bus. Mr Johnson said he was sickened and furious at a clip of his own staff laughing about a Christmas bash four days after it happened last December, when lockdown rules banned social gatherings. Mr Johnson faced calls to extend the investigation to include a leaving do on November , . It is claimed Mr Johnson gave a speech and his former senior aide Lord Lister was thereAnd he was also asked about claims, which he denied, from Dominic Cummings that there was a smaller gathering in the Downing Street flat Mr Johnson shares with we Carrie.Sources told the Mirror that senior No  aides “were all drinking their socks off” at the alleged gathering on November  last year. Downing Street staff reported hearing “loud music pumping out of the flat” late into the night after Mr Cummings, the PM’s former top aide, had walked out of No . A spokeswoman for Carrie Johnson dismissed the claims as “total nonsense”. The Department for Education’s top official announced that Gavin Williamson’s staff party in the run-up to last Christmas will also be investigated by the Cabinet Secretary. No also faces questions over a report by the BBC into a Christmas quiz that took place in person at the Cabinet Office with No staff joining in.Mr Johnson said he had asked Cabinet Secretary Simon Case to look at allegations relating to December , rather than at any other dates. Any aides found guilty of breaking the rules would face disciplinary action. One of the PM’s most senior aides Allegra Stratton tearfully quit after leaked footage showed her laughing and joking about a Christmas party and Covid rules while the rest of the country faced restrictions. Mr Johnson claimed he was “furious” about the leaked footage of Ms Stratton. The politan Police acknowledged it had received “a signicant amount of correspondence” relating to the alleged breaches in No  in the run up to Christmas last year but said they do not “provide evidence of a breach” of Covid rules. “Based on the absence of evidence and in line with our policy not to investigate retrospective breaches of such regulations, the Met will not commence an investigation at this time,” it added. But the force did leave open the possibility of further inquiries by saying it would consider “any evidence” that emerges in the Case inquiry. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said the Met should be “knocking on doors, taking statements and investigating people in No  in the way they would my constituents or anyone  in the country”. “It seems implausible for the politan Police to argue there is no evidence that parties took place,” he told reporters. “They’ve got to pursue this investigation without fear or favour and treat the Prime Minister and his staff as they would treat anyone . It can’t be one rule for the Prime Minister and another for everyone .” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyShaun BaileyBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Boris Johnson on Wednesday that there was an exemption for singing.However, anti-maskers who wish to get around the rules by singing their way round the aisles could still face fines or prosecution - despite the apparent loophole. That is because the singing exemption will be classed under “reasonable excuses”. Thereforepeople are singing without a reasonable excuse - such as in Tesco as a protest - they could be seen to be pushing the boundaries of the law. This was mainly seen as being applicable to places of worship where a mask should be worn during the service but could be removed to sing carols or hymns. But officials confirmed on Thursday this would also be applicable to other indoor settings. Asked whether a shopper could therefore remove their mask in Tescothey were singing, it was confirmed that would be within the rules as would removing the mask to sing in a theatre. But the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “I would urge, as the public has been throughout, to be responsible and sensible, and that is what we have seen.”  He said: “It’s about striking the right balance. We recognise that whenever you’re deciding which measures or restrictions to introduce, you do need to draw appropriate balance.” He added that it was “practical and sensible” to put the measures in place. The exemption is another example of how the new measures appear to have some idiosyncrasies. Masks do not need to be worn in hospitality settings, eventhe person is not eating or drinking. And under Plan B people are being told to work from homethey can from next week, but Mr Johnson said it was still possible for Christmas parties to go ahead. And the guidance would not stop colleagues gathering at a pub to do their jobs. Officials confirmed there was nothing within the rules to stop colleagues meeting at a pub to work, with the focus being on reducing the transmission risk from the commute and within the workplace. It would be up to employers and employees to decide how to interpret the new guidance. But the advice is thata worker does not need to go into the office, they should work from home, in order to slow the spread of the Omicron iant. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “Obviously, we have, sadly, been in this position before and employers and employee, by and large, have demonstrated that they’re able to work together and come up with an agreement recognising both business need and also the needs of iniduals and personal le circumstances.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TescoPlan BBoris JohnsonPublic transportPoliticsChristmas shoppingChristmas partyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Paul Oxborrow, , from Norwich runs Thorpe Plant Centre with son Elliott, . In , he came up with the novel idea of pushing human beings into netting used for festive firs - and itaposs since become a tradition. As word spread of his funny idea, Paul set up a special grotto, complete with fairy lights, that customers can visit in order to be aposnettedapos - using biodegradable mesh, of course. Anyone who wants to become a human Christmas tree simply has to make a donation to Paulaposs chosen charity - and it attracts all sorts of people. Paul said: We had a gentleman go through the netting machine who was probably in his mid-s. He didnapost stop laughing from start to finish. Weaposve had kids as young as  months. Some kids go home like Christmas trees, they hop to their parentsapos car.  Weaposve had parents come back saying, aposWhen you netted our son last weekend, he stayed like that all Saturday afternoon in the living room.apos So far this year, Paul has raised £ by netting human beings - with the proceeds going towards food parcels for Thorpe Helping Hands, a local community group. Paul said: This year weaposre asking people to make their donations, then we use the money to put together boxes of non-perishable food. Helping Hands have agreed to take these parcels off our hands and distribute them just before Christmas to families and iniduals who need support. So, hopefully, itaposs spreading a little goodwill and joy to vulnerable people. Itaposs not a massive thing, but weaposre in a world whereeveryone did a little bit it would be much better.The salesman reckons heaposs had people travel  miles for the experience of becoming a human Christmas tree as word of his tradition has spread.Three years ago, when we first started doing this, but it wasnapost that well-publicised, one family of four turned up in Christmas jumpers and they all went through the netting machine, said Paul.Then the lady proceeded to take out Christmas tree ornaments, baubles and tinsel and decorate everyone, before taking some photos.He first got the idea to turn humans into Christmas trees when his son and daughter, Kayleigh, played games of jumping into the netting as kids. However, although heaposs won a lot of fans with his human netting machine, Paulaposs not tempted to try it out himself.Iaposm sure my family would find it hilarious, he said. But Iaposm a bit on the large size - or at least thataposs my excuse!I could probably squeeze through, but Iaposve never particularly felt the urge to do it.Paul and Kayleigh are first-aid trained in case anything ever goes wrong with the human netting process - although theyaposve not had any disasters so far. When someone goes through the machine, they have to line up with the cylinder before working their way inside. Then Paul grabs their wrists and pulls them through. He said: For that moment they really are a human Christmas tree!

Dickie Borthwick, , played his first match as a young boy and has continued for over seven decades. But in recent years he has been sidelined by the pandemic, back pain and a chest infection. The Sunday league footballer is now planning his own testimonial. The grandfather-of-seven said: “I’ve just had my th birthday. With the time away from playing, then the chest infection I think it is time to pack it in. “I’ve had a good run. “I’ve still got the urge to get out there and kick the ball around butyou can’t do it, then you can’t do it. “I’d love to play one final match when the weather gets warmer.“I’ll be getting two teams, all over s, together to play at Portland United’s football ground - that’s where I played most of my veteran’s matches.” Dickie, who beat prostate cancer nearly  years ago, has played over , matches and scored around  goals. The retired engineer last turned out for local veterans team AFC Wyke Smugglers in December  at the age of .  But a combination of sciatica and the Covid- lockdowns put him out for over a year. Dickie, of Weymouth, Dorset, says more recent health problems forced him to consider his future in the game. He explained: “I’ve had a really nasty chest infection but I managed to pull through. “Before that I had sciatica and before that I couldn’t play because of the pandemic. “Because I’ve had such a long break away from the game, I think it would probably be too much of a struggle to play again, especially in cold weather.”  Dickie was born in  and began playing football aged seven. He has seen  England managers come and go and says he has no interest in playing gentler forms of the game. He said: “I wouldn’t play walking football. “I’m used to playing the whole  minutes at full pelt. “I still want to play the game properly.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Back painProstate cancerSunday League football\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But Calderdale Council, the authority responsible for lighting the festive fir, has defended the tree’s decorations, or lack of, by explaining that the natural tree had grown “signicantly larger”. It therefore was no longer safe to reach its highest sections, the council reasoned.But Conservative councillor George Robinson described it as a aposshamblesapos and locals fumed that after close to two years of Covid regulations, theyaposd hoped for some festive joy.Mr Robinson said: Weaposve had a torrid year with Covid and lockdowns, we just want a Christmas tree to enjoy.  Itaposs a shambles, the worst Christmas tree in the North.According to Yorkshire Live reports, ex-Halax rugby league ace Jamie Bloem fumed: After the two years everyone has gone through, a Christmas tree to bring a bit of cheer is a necessity.It would be a bit of colour in an otherwise dull time. And now with tighter restrictions, I think a bit of cheer would be great right now. Margaret Bates said: Iaposve just driven past this. I thought there must be a fault in the lights. Please tell me itaposs not meant to be like this - it looks ridiculous. Dave Cocker quipped: Who was decorating it, Warwick Davis and Mini Me  One wag online quipped: Bailf Bridgeaposs pledge to reduce their carbon footprint has been put in to force.  While another said it was the aposmost depressing Christmas tree decorations in the UKapos. However, Matt Bell was quick to defend the council, saying: People be laughing at health and safety restrictions are the same ones suing the council over sh*t that happens to them. The Labour-controlled council said it provided trees and decorations to bring some festive cheer to towns and villages. The tree remains in place all year round and was decorated as in previous years, it said. But council added the tree had grown signicantly larger and due to safety and accessibility the decorations were spread amongst the lower branches. Cllr Jenny Lynn, cabinet member for public services and communities, said: “We provide Christmas trees and decorations across Calderdale to bring some festive cheer to our towns and villages, and we wish all our residents a very happy Christmas. “The tree in Bailf Bridge is a naturally growing one, which remains in place all year round and is now several years old. We have decorated the tree this year, like we have in previous years. As the tree has grown signicantly larger over time, and due to its location, it is no longer safe or accessible to decorate the highest sections of the tree, as they can’t be reached by any maintenance vehicles. Therefore, this year we are only able to decorate the lower branches. “Next year we will ask local community groups to nominate another, more easily accessible tree, for a much fuller decoration.”  The tree isn’t the first to be criticised this festive season the Trafalgar Square Christmas tree has been branded a aposflea-bitten embarrassmentapos, with criticism prompting Norway officials, who gted the tree, to consider providing a replacement.The treeaposs official account, run by Westminster City Council, said: “I would like everyone to know that half of my branches are not missing...

Jen passed away a few days later following a battle with cancer. Early last year, Jen, , celebrated five years of being cancer-free after undergoing treatment for breast cancer. However, just before lockdown, the maths teacher was diagnosed with cancer again.  The mum-of-five began a new battle with the disease but tragically passed away peacefully on November  with husband Ben, , by her side. The couple were originally going to get married on November Ben, from Newport, Shropshire, said: There was just us, Jenaposs mom and two witnesses. We played Bon Jovi for Jen, got her in her dress, and had some bubbly. It was perfect. The nurses hung Jenaposs dress up in her room so she could look at it when she was in bed. The kids were so excited about the wedding I was worried about coming home and telling them weaposd got married and that they hadnapost been able to be there, but they were just so happy for us. One happy thing to come from the arrangements for the original wedding is that the th is going to be turned into a mega birthday party for my girls, who all have their birthdays before Xmas. Jen had two children with her ex-husband and after meeting Ben and then went on to have three more children.  Ben said: The community has also very kindly donated to a Just Giving page for the wedding costs and they have kept things open for a fund to help me and the kids stay afloat. I had no idea how I would get five kids through Christmas and three birthdays when my salary will barely cover the bills on my own, the donations will help me make sure that their first birthday Christmas without mum is as happy as can be. My one daughter even insisted on wearing her wedding dress to school for children in need of a non-unorm day.  Her last moments were with me holding her hand. I told her that I loved her and the kids loved her. The movie that had been playing in the background had just finished and I sad to the nurse aposI canapost believe the last film sheaposll ever watch is Big Mommaaposs Houseapos, a stupid joke to break the tension and the nurse and I laughed. Then I noticed that her chest wasnapost moving and asked the nurse to check and sheaposd gone.  So either the last thing she heard was aposThe kids love youapos or another stupid comment from me. I think Jen would have been happy with either. I stayed with her for a while, holding her hand and talking to her while my friend came to pick me up. Then I gave her one last kiss and said aposGood night Beachapos , and I went home to the kids. Ben shared a photo of the couple after their nuptials on Twitter just two days before Jen died, writing: I finally married the love of my le on Wednesday. Not the day we had planned but amazing.Iaposm heartbroken that this marriage will be counted in days not years. Donapost put things off, tell the people you love that you love them now. The post has now collected over , likes, , retweets and , likes from users who shared their congratulations.

The former director of the Runnymede Trust has warned that children are the biggest unprotected group and should be better shielded ahead of Christmas. The introduction of so-called Plan B is staggered, with face mask rules kicking in tomorrow, a working from home order on Monday and vaccine passport requirements from Wednesday. Dr Haque said rules around face masks made little sense and should be required in more indoor spaces. Indi Sage have been asking the Government this for several weeks now, she told Sky News of the Plan B rules.  Weaposve reached over ,a couple of times since the start of school term. It is not too soon, itaposs a good time to introduce it, but it doesnapost go far enough. Dr Haque continued: What we need to understand is we are facing an extremely transmissible iant. The Omicron iant is doubling every two and a half days. The biggest unprotected group right now are children, and yet theyaposre not vaccinated, there are no mitigations in school, the Government have not come up with a single measure to protect children in school. We would be asking for face masks in classrooms, the Government to improve ventilation over Christmas, the reintroduction of bubbles, and fewer parties in schools. The Government is talking about face masks, in some places like theatres but not in restaurants. It doesnapost work. The virus doesnapost know when to stop and when to carry on. We need comprehensive, good information about face masks from the Government and comprehensive coverage.  Dr Haque praised the Government for re-introducing the work for home mandate as of Monday, but said it sent a mixed message. At the same time they have said go ahead and carry on partying, she continued. That is an extremely confusing and dangerous message to send to the public. The scientist went on to criticise Downing Street for not requiring people to self-isolatethey test positive. She urged Brits to keep themselves as safe as possible by wearing high-quality face masks, limiting socialising and having smaller gatherings.Dr Haque is not the only expert to find fault with the Governmentaposs latest coronavirus plan. Professor Andrew Hayward, a member of Noaposs own Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies, has warned that we aposneed much more severe restrictions to turn it aroundapos. He told Sky News the virus is moving very fast so itaposs important that we react to that fast. He added: Itaposs a bit likeyou think of a monthaposs worth of rain falling in a few days, that leads to flooding and itaposs a similar type of scenario... we can reduce that by reducing social mixing and allow time to slow the virus down and get vaccine into more peopleaposs arms. Professor Paul Hunter, an epidemiologist based at the University of East Anglia, said Plan B was not enough to control Omicron.I am quite pessimistic that we could control the spread of omicron at present, he told Mail Online.  But I am hopeful that because we have both high vaccine coverage and high prior infection and because we are rolling out the booster dose better than virtually anywhere  we can at least manage the impact of the increase in omicron. I think plan B would be enough to push R below . for most delta, though uncertain it would stop AY.. — Delta plus. The new regulations will be put to a debate and vote in the Commons next week and with Labouraposs support they are certain to be approved, despite the prospect of a large Conservative revolt. Plan B is also facing criticism from those who believe it is too restrictive. Tory MP Marcus Fysh described plans to bring in Covid health certicates as really draconian and an utter disgrace.He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme that vaccine passports are a massive imposition on our liberties.He added: Itaposs a disgrace that theyaposre pursuing that, utter disgrace. He accused Government scientic advisers and Englandaposs chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty of having a history of over-egging the data and picking data points out that suit their narrative. However, the Yeovil MP also suggested Omicron was proven to produce milder cases than Delta - a claim not backed by scientists.

Strangely, for such an exceptional feature, it does not seem to have been documented until the end of the th century, and very little has been written about it since. Situated four metres back into the solid rock of the clf, a narrow tunnel opens out into a small chamber in which there sits a rock-cut bath, roughly one metre deep and always full.According toCornwall Live , the bath was built at the end of the s for the botanist John Stackhouse, who owned nearby Acton Castle. By the end of the th century, the benefits of bathing in sea water and in spring water were widely recognised by the aristocracy, and as a botanist spending time in the spa town of Bath with a special interest in marine algae, this growing health obsession did not escape the attention of Stackhouse. After he married Susanna Acton in , John Stackhouse had Acton Castle built above the remote Cornish cove where he found himself spending most of his time, studying seaweed and marine algae. At some point between  and Stackhouse had two rock-cut baths carved out for him down at the cove. Some say it was because he was suffering from rheumatism, others say that they were for his we, Susanna.  The first bath was a tidal seawater pool, cut into the rock on the beach with steps and a drain to keep the water at a constant level. These outdoor baths cut into rock at beaches can be found where in Cornwall, such as at Portreath, where there are seven of them. However, the second bath, inside a cave that had been carved out of the clf, with its own constant flow of natural spring water, was unlike anything . Roughly two metres above the beach, the entrance to this peculiar bath resembles an adit to a mine shaft- clearly man made in appearance, but with bright green moss and algae cascading out of it and down the rocks to the ground. Originally, there were steps cut into the rock, leading up to the entrance, but these have been worn away by the sea over time. The small tunnel, which is about cm wide and .m high, leads back into total darkness. The only clue of what is at the end is the dripping of the natural bath tap that has been left on for two centuries.  Venturing into the tunnel, as daylight fades, the rich greens and reds of the algal biofilms on the rock begin to glow. The floor of the tunnel is carpeted in a wet green moss. Four metres in, the tunnel opens out into the chamber which is almost entirely taken up by the bath, and has very little light, apart from that coming through the tunnel, and down from a man-made vertical shaft designed to feed the natural spring down into the bath. The first detailed documentation of Stackhouse’s cave bath is considered to be by Michael Tangye, when he wrote about ‘Rock-cut baths in Cornwall’ in the Cornwall Archaeological Society’s  booklet. In it, he writes: “This remarkable and unique feature lies within the rock clf face at the centre of the cove. Here, several feet above the beach level is a tunnel which at first glance resembles a mine adit outlet. It appears to have been originally approached by rock-cut steps ascending from the beach on the south side, of which only one, at the top, has survived sea erosion.”  Writing about the tunnel into the bath chamber, Tangye continues: “Pick marks can be seen on its walls. This leads into a rock-cut chamber ftsquare and fthigh. In its floor a rectangular bath has been sunk ftlong, ft inswide, and ftdeep. The vertical shaft that feeds the bath with slightly alkaline spring water is a sophisticated part of the design, and is described by Tangye as such: “In the north-west corner of the roof, a rectangular chimney-like shaft, again cut from the solid rock, ascends some ftto the clf top. Fresh water, from a small stream, drains into this, falls down the shaft, then through a hole in the stone roof of the chamber, ft insby ft ins , and into the bath beneath. The constant overflow drains along the approach tunnel to the exterior. This fresh water bath, situated within its dark, cold and secluded chamber must have been again created for John Stackhouse and Susanna, his we.” There have been suggestions that for such a sophisticated natural spring-fed bath system to be built, John Stackhouse would have employed experts from Bath, where he also chose his architect for Acton Castle. However, the local knowledge and skill of tunnelling into clfs in that area was unmatched at the time.  Stackhouse had appointed local man John Carter as caretaker and key holder of Acton Castle, and entrusted him with the property for the long periods when he was not there. But along with his brother, Harry, John Carter was a notorious smuggler, calling himself the ‘King of Prussia’ and creating a maze of smuggler’s tunnels on the south coast. Whether John Stackhouse was aware of Carter’s smuggling activities is unclear, but he would certainly have known his skill with a pick axe. Regardless of who built this hidden bathroom, it is unlikely to become popular again soon. Without the long exposures of the camera revealing the warm colours inside, the reality is that this space is cold, dark and teaming with spiders and marine bugs like sea slaters. With the steps eroded away, access is treacherous and the strange echoes inside the cave can be unnerving. But for an th century algae-loving botanist who wanted some privacy on his favourite beach, this bathroom would have been heaven.

The five-year-old had endured months of suffering but even as her eyesight was failing, her spirits were lted by a very special moment sur­­rounded by those she loved most. “Santa Claus arrived to give Bella a little key with bells on it,” recalls mum Beccy, . “We knew she could hear him but her sight was going. “After he left she carried on shaking the bells. It was really magical and we’ll always be grateful for that.” Just two days later, on September , , Bella passed away.

Beccy says: “At first it was very hard to look back on the pictures of that special Christmas. It was bittersweet because they were a reminder that within two days she was gone.

Beccy says: “She seemed fine during the day. “But when she went to bed it was as though she was struggling to breathe. We went back and forth to the doctor and even AE a few times but it wasn’t until January  we had a diagnosis.” Doctors found a tumour on Bella’s lung. Beccy recalls: “I was at the hospital with my mum Tracy because Craig, who is in the Navy, was away. “I couldn’t bring myself to tell him. “The tumour was taking up almost her whole left lung and was going into her right one. I couldn’t get the words out. Mum had to do it.” By Jason Beattie For the majority of families this Christmas will be a joyous time of presents, food and fun. But for some children the festive season will be very dferent. Across the country there are more than , young people who are critically ill. Many will be spending what should be a special time of the year in hospital. Others will have to have treatment, scans or blood tests. With your help we can give them a Christmas that they will always remember. This year’s Mirror Christmas Appeal is raising funds for Make-A-Wish UK that helps seriously ill young people make their dreams come true.It could be they want to meet their hero or heroine or feed an animal at the zoo or travel to see Santa in Lapland. The money raised could help Joshua, six, who has severe epilepsy, achieve his wish of a bedroom makeover or Summer, also six, who has acute leukaemia and dreams of a bouncy castle. Each year Make-A-Wish helps hundreds of critically ill children achieve their letime’s ambition. But to make a wish come true takes an army of volunteers, supporters and donors. That’s why every penny you donate could make a dference. Granting a wish can transform a child’s le. It gives them something to look forward to. For others it provides a special memory which makes the treatment they need more bearable.It can also help their parents who, despite doing everything they can for their sick child, feel it is not enough. Jason Suckley, Make-A-Wish UK chief executive, said: “I met the family of a boy who was recovering from brain surgery. “His grandmother told me how dficult it had been for her to watch her daughter struggle with the challenges of her son’s condition.But while they were enjoying his wish together, her daughter turned to her and said, ‘There is still magic in this world isn’t there mum ’ . “That’s just one instance that illustrates how the power of a wish lies in sharing positive memories with loved ones. “Every donation from Mirror readers will help us create those memories – bringing joy to ill children and their families during the darkest of times.” Once an initial course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy came to an end by the summer, the family were hopeful that things were looking up. Aged four and with her health much im­­­proved, Bella started school. But in April  things took another dev­­astating turn when she had a stroke. Beccy, who lives in Devon, says: “They found another tumour, this time on her brain. It was horrendous. She had gone from going to bed as usual to suddenly not being able to speak or walk. “She was paralysed down one side. They removed the tumour but there were still cancer cells left. Within a couple of weeks it was really hard to communicate with her and poor Bella would get frustrated.”  Weeks after the surgery, Beccy and Craig took their daughter home. Beccy says: “She was getting distressed in hospital so we brought her back to Plymouth. “She did a lot better and within a couple of weeks she was crawling round. As time went on, she was walking and talking more and more and most things really started to come back.” Although Bella was doing well, the family accepted that her condition could never be cured. But they hoped chemotherapy could slow the disease’s progress. Beccy recalls: “We continued that for a while. But it was no quality of le. “We decided to stop in July . “It was incredibly dficult but we knew the tumours would just grow. “We filled so much into that summer.” Beccy and Craig dreamed of sharing one last Christmas together as a family. Beccy, who runs a dog-walking business, adds: “The people at Make-A-Wish UK were amazing. They were able to move really quickly for us because we realised we didn’t have long. “Lots of our extended family got together at a big house in Challaborough, Devon, and we had our very own Christmas – in September. They had organised an amazing lunch cooked by two chefs at a local pub. There were presents for everyone, a tree, a huge snow globe and games for all. “Santa turned up and gave Bella her key with bells on and she loved listening to the sound as she shook it.” Looking back on those final days, Beccy says:“There’s no way we could have organised what they did. They did an incredible job in such a short time and treated us with such kindness.

The Department for Work and Pensions approved Emad Al Swealmeen’s application even though it was previously ruled he could not stay in the UK.The decision could have made it easier for him to build the lestyle to plot and fund the ball bearing-filled device, which almost killed expectant mums and their babies, LiverpoolECHO reports. Al Swealmeen was handed a National Insurance number by the DWP in November , it was reported. At the time, he was living in specialist asylum accommodation in Liverpool and it was the same home where counter-terror detectives found “suspicious items” in the aftermath of the Remembrance Sunday explosion.  It is alleged Government agencies knew where Al Swealmeen was living and were in communication with him despite having rejected his bid to remain four years earlier. It is understood that Al Swealmeen’s successful National Insurance application may have come after he was granted the right to work. This permission could have been grantedthose vetting him didnapost find his failed asylum application from . However, it is thought that Al Swealmeen made at least one further bid for asylum, which was knocked back in . The Government explains on its website: “The Home Office may grant permission to work to asylum seekers whose claim has been outstanding for more than  months through no fault of their own.”  The then Immigration Minister Caroline Noakes confirmed this process in April , seven months before Al Swealmeen was told his National Insurance application had been successful. If his later application had been hit with administrative delays he could have taken advantage to be able to work get permission to work while he waited for a decision. If had done this he would have only had the right to work in jobs that feature on the Shortage Occupation List.  Details of what Al Swealmeen did in Liverpool are scarce, but it is known to have worked in a takeaway in Sefton in  and enrolled on a cake decorating course at the City of Liverpool College in . While a National Insurance number is not proof of the right to stay in the UK, it is likely to boost his credibility when applying for roles, it was reported. Home Office statistics showed , claims had been waiting for more than six months at the end of September . The Refugee Council branded the system as “ineffective and riddled with backlogs”.  Questions over the circumstances of Al Swealmean’s immigration status and whether problems with assessing his latest asylum application gave him the opportunity to work and receive a National Insurance number are likely to be asked. There are more questions over how he was able to fund his bomb-making plot. Al Swealmeen is known to have begun renting a flat in April  and counter-terror police believe that is when he had started plotting his bomb attack.  This was the property in which he is believed to have turned into a bomb-producing lair and where he was picked up from in a taxi that he later blew up in the hospital car park, killing himself and injuring driver David Perry. Detectives have said the explosion could have been far more serious, with Counter Terror Police North West revealing: It was made using homemade explosive and had ball bearings attached to it which would have acted as shrapnel. Had it detonated in dferent circumstances we believe it would have caused signicant injury or death.” It is not known when or how he was radicalised.  It is understood he arrived in the UK in  and lodged an asylum claim, in which an applicant must be able to show they have left their country and are unable to go back “because you fear persecution”. It was unsuccessful and an appeal was refused. A judge threw out the challenge after concluding there were no grounds to overturn the decision in . This meant that Al Swealmeen, who was born in Iraq, did not have the right to stay in the UK. In the same year, he was baptised but also appeared before Liverpool Magistrates’ Court and admitted a charge of possession of a blade in a public place.  Reports suggest he was handed a conditional discharge, but it is believed he was also sectioned shortly afterwards.Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust, which provides most of the specialist mental health care in the city, has confirmed he had accessed its services but was not a service user at the time of his death.It was around this time Al Swealmeen was taken in by Malcolm and Elizabeth Hitchcott, a devout Christian couple for around eight months. They said he converted from Islam to Christianity and he was confirmed in , but lost touch with the church in . The Hitchcotts said Al Swealmeen would sometimes go by the alias Enzo Almeni due to his love of Italian car racing legend Enzo Ferrari and to appear “more Western” in his asylum bid. However, his application for a National Insurance number was made under his birth name, and not his ‘Westernised’ alias, the ECHO understands, and was submitted after he had moved into Sutclfe Street accommodation provided to him. The ECHO approached the Home Office with details of Al Swealmeen’s National Insurance number claim but the organisation declined to comment.

Ian Bennett, , kned Kerry Woolley, also , to death at her flat in Olton, Solihull, West Midlands, on July  last year after ly accusing her of sleeping with another woman. A post mortem revealed that Ms Woolley had suffered more than  kne wounds, most inflicted on her neck. Bennett then roped his mother Lynda Bennett, , into a cowardly plot to help him conceal the crime. She drove him to a canal bridge to dispose of the murder weapons.  But the plan backfired when dash cam footage from her own car helped convict the pair in court. Other evidence found on Bennettaposs phone found that he had researched: The best way to get revenge on a woman. Bennett, of Solihull, was found guilty of murder at Birmingham Crown Court and was jailed for le and ordered to serve a minimum of  years. His mother Lynda was convicted of assisting an offender and perverting the course of justice was sentenced to three years in prison. The court was told how Bennett had called  on the afternoon of the murder, telling officers he had found mum-of-two Kerry with catastrophic wounds to her neck.  He claimed he had left the flat in the early hours of July  and had then been unable to get back in contact with Kerry. Police bodycam footage captured Bennettaposs crocodile tears as he tells cops: Iaposve been trying to call and ring her all day, no answers. So I thought Iaposd knock on. The door wasnapost open so I had to pull the handle and then I walked into that...found her dead. He then points at the door and sobs: Itaposs horric. Although initially no weapon could be located Bennett was arrested on suspicion of murder. His mum was also captured on camera calmly arriving at the scene to ask police why her son was being arrested despite knowing full well what had happened. At one point she even laughs when an officer tells her Bennett is being taken to a station in Coventry and she scoffs: I donapost know how to get to Coventry. Officers analysed text messages between the couple, who only met a few weeks before, which suggested there had been a falling out a couple of days earlier. Bennett appeared to be angry, accusing Kerry of cheating on him, although this was groundless, and that she was also messaging a former partner.  Mobile phone data also revealed that both Bennettaposs and Kerryaposs phones went apossilentapos around .pm on July , despite being in regular contact previously. Bennettaposs phone did become active again at .am, when he made attempts to contact her, knowing that she was in fact already dead. A dashcam in Lyndaaposs car revealed it had left the address Bennett shared with his parents and took a  minute journey round Solihull. Cell site data retrieved from her phone was consistent with Lynda being the driver of the car. The vehicle firstly stopped on Damson Lane, where CCTV footage clearly showed Bennett throwing a bundle into the canal. A large kne with a bent blade was later recovered during a search of the water.  The car then stopped near shops at Prospect Lane, and again CCTV picked up Bennett, carrying a plastic bag into parkland before ing to the car without the bag. Another search of the park land resulted in a bag being recovered and inside were blood-stained womenaposs jogging bottoms and a pair of oven gloves. Forensic examinations later matched Sarahaposs DNA to both the kne from the canal and the blood-stained items found in the park. Two knives had been used, one with a serrated blade, the second with a smooth blade.

Upon venturing out for a walk with her newborn in Sparkhill, Birmingham, Shabnum Shah found it dficult to navigate the pavement due to the number of cars parked across it. The poor parking left her no choice but to push her eight-week-old son in his buggy onto busy roads to get around the obstructions, she told Birmingham Live.

It has been reported that father and son have barely spoken over the last eight months and that relations between them are at an all-time low. It is alleged the pair have had only a few fraught conversations on the phone since Harry and we Meghan Markle quit their roles as senior royals and moved to Calornia in .Earlier this week, Harry said he severed ties with Saudi billionaire Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz a year before he was presented the CBE by Charles.  The Duke of Sussex reportedly had concerns over the businessman’s motives as he donated large sums to Charlesaposs charity. The prince then gave Mr Mahfouz - who denies any wrongdoing - a CBE in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace in . And Harryaposs comments have been seen by some as one-upmanship over his father as the royal rt between the prince and his family continues.

According to royal expert Camilla Tominey, those who know Charles say he wonapost be angry with the comments - just sad.Writing in the , she says one former aide told her: The prince absolutely adores Harry. He will feel absolutely devastated by this distraught.He’ll be beside himselfthis means he also becomes more ostracised from his grandchildren. It’s such a sad state of affairs.  Next year, Harry is set to release a tell-all memoir, which he promises will be a wholly-truthful and accurate account of his le so far. And author Andrew Morton, who famously wrote a biography on Princess Diana, says that Charles could be in the firing line again when Harryaposs book is published.He told the Royally Us podcast: If I was Prince Charles, I’d be looking for a pile of coats to hide under. Because I think that the book that’s going to come out next year is written by someone who spends a lot of time investigating father-son relationships because he ghost-wrote a book on Andre Agassi, who had a dficult relationship with his father. So I think we’re going to see Charles once more in the firing line. SoI was Prince Charles, I’d be looking for a hard hat and a flak jacket.But according to The Sun, Charles, , is keeping a dignied silence about his relationship with his son.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryPrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dedicated servants, many who were forced to spend substantial amounts of time away from their loved ones over the pandemic after entering protective bubbles at Windsor Castle and Balmoral to protect the monarch, said there was “palpable anger” at the revelations over illegal lockdown parties in government.The Queen was evacuated from Buckingham Palace at the start of the pandemic and formed a support bubble with her beloved late husband Prince Philip who moved from his home at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk.Other royal staff said “sacrices made from the very top all the way down” to keep people safe were being rendered “worthless”. One servant with more than  years service within the household said some colleagues had become “visibly upset” when discussing how the Queen was forced to sit alone at her beloved late husband’s funeral in April due to coronavirus restrictions.Her Majesty, like thousands of others across the nation as the pandemic raged on, complied with covid restrictions leaving them to alter plans for funerals or tragically being unable to say goodbye to their loved ones as they lay dying in hospital. Staff who cared for the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh throughout the pandemic told how they had made “huge sacrices” to maintain strict covid bubbles in the belief they were “doing out bit” to keep the monarch safe from the deadly virus. One said: “It would be a gross understatement to say people are angry. “Many missed Christmas, birthdays, other special occasions and weeks on end away from their families. “But it was all in the spirit it was for the greater good and we were doing our bit. “It’s a slap in the face for anyone frankly.”  The Queen was last year forced to spend a final Christmas alone with Prince Philip at Windsor Castle, before he passed away aged  in April. The image of the -year-old dressed in black with a black mask covering nearly her entire face while sitting alone in St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle will be forever etched in the nation’s memory. Labour leader Sir Keir on Wednesday highlighted the head of state’s leadership and the sacrices she made at the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral during the Covid- crisis at Prime Minister’s Questions.He was speaking as Boris Johnson faced the furore over claims Downing Street staff broke lockdown rules by holding a Christmas party last year.Sir Keir told the Commons: “Her Majesty the Queen sat alone when she marked the passing of the man she’d been married to for  years. “Leadership, sacrice - that’s what gives leaders the moral authority to lead. “Does the Prime Minister think he has the moral authority to lead and to ask the British people to stick to the rules ” The Queen was due to have her weekly audience with the Prime Minister on Wednesday, either by person or by phone. Buckingham Palace did not comment. Her Majesty has been resting on doctors’ orders and only carrying out light duties such as audiences since spending a night in hospital for preliminary tests on October , and later spraining her back. She is also preparing to film her Christmas Day message to the nation. The Queen is likely to use her annual pre-recorded televised speech, which she writes herself, to reflect on the ongoing challenges facing the country, as well as touching on her own personal grief with the loss of Philip in April. The royal family is hoping to gather to celebrate Christmas with the monarch at her Sandringham estate in Norfolk after last year’s festivities were curtailed due to the pandemic.

Astronomers described the spectacular fireworks show as troubling - warning a similar event could hit Earth. It would fry satellites in orbit and crash power grids serving entire cities - causing widespread blackouts and knocking out phone networks. The star is named EK Draconis - Latin for dragon. And it is breathing fire. It lies in the constellation of Draco in the far northern sky. Known as a CME , the sun shoots out such eruptions on a regular basis. They are made up of clouds of extremely-hot particles, or plasma, that hurtle through space at millions of miles an hour.And they are potentially bad news. Every  years or so, they are released in our direction. Co-author Dr Yuta Notsu, of the University of Colorado Boulder, said: Coronal mass ejections can have a serious impact on Earth and human society. The international team observed the astonishing burst of energy pouring out of EK Draconis. It was much more powerful than any seen before. Experts fear a catastrophic solar storm will hit us - by the end of the century. Study leader Kosuke Namekata, a PhD student at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, said it could be just as strong. The researchers used ground and space-based telescopes to peer at EK Draconis - which resembles a young version of the sun. It emitted a mass of scorching plasma in the quadrillions of kilograms - over ten times bigger than the previous record from a sun-like star. Dr Notsu said: It may serve as a warning of just how dangerous the weather in space can be.This kind of big mass ejection could, theoretically, also occur on our Sun. This observation may also help us to better understand how similar events may have affected Earth and even Mars over billions of years. He explained CMEs often occur right after a star lets loose a flare or sudden and bright burst of radiation that can extend far out into space. An earlier study by the same group found young sun-like stars around the galaxy experience frequent apossuperflaresapos. They are like our own solar flares - but tens or even hundreds of times more potent. Such a superflare could, theoretically, also happen on Earthaposs sun - and lead to an equally enormous CME. Dr Notsu said: Superflares are much bigger than the flares we see from the sun. So we suspect they would also produce much bigger mass ejections. But until recently, that was just conjecture.  He described EK Draconis as a curious star. It is about the same size as the sun - but just  million years old. Dr Notsu said: It is what our sun looked like . billion years ago. The researchers watched the star for  nights in winter and spring last year.They scanned it with NASA aposs TESSand Japanaposs SEIMEI telescopes.On April , they got lucky as EK Draconis erupted into a superflare - a really big one. Half an hour later, a CME flew from the staraposs surface. The researchers were only able to catch the first step in its le - the aposfilament eruptionapos phase. But even so, it was a monster - moving at a top speed of roughly one million miles per hour. It does not bode well for le on Earth. The findings in Nature Astronomy hint the sun is also capable of such violent extremes. But, looking on the bright side, super CMEs are probably rarer in older stars. They may have been much more common in the early years of the solar system. Gigantic coronal mass ejections, in other words, could have helped to shape planets like Earth and Mars into what they look like today.  Dr Notsu said: The atmosphere of present-day Mars is very thin compared to Earthaposs. In the past, we think Mars had a much thicker atmosphere. Coronal mass ejections may help us understand what happened to the planet over billions of years. Two years ago researchers at the US Geological Survey predicted a solar storm could hit us at any moment - with no guarantee weaposll spot it coming. They examined an event now known as the New York Railroad Storm, which plunged large parts of the northeastern United States into darkness in May . According to the report, several gigantic CMEs bombarded Earth at once - juicing up Earthaposs magnetic field and causing widespread destruction. If it happened in the modern world, the cost would run into trillions of dollars. In , a huge CME which could have decimated electronics missed the Earth by just nine days. The event was comparable to the  Carrington Event, in which telegraph operators suffered electric shocks and sparks exploded from pylons.

In the two weeks to Sunday  December, there were  confirmed cases of the new iant in West Northamptonshire and eight confirmed cases in Croydon, Hackney, Lambeth, Newham and Lewisham. Seven confirmed Omicron cases were detected in Brent, Buckinghamshire, Greenwich, plus six in Wandsworth.  In addition, genomic testing had discovered cases where there had been a “S gene drop-out”in the virus that is not seen in the Delta iant and is likely to be a proxy for Omicron. The “majority” of the  suspected Omicron cases were located in London and the South East, the report said. In the week to Sunday, there were  such cases in West Northamptonshire,  in Lewisham,  in Buckinghamshire,  in Newham, nine in Greenwich, eight in Lambeth, seven in Brent, six in Hackney and Wandsworth and two in Croydon.  The UKHSA has estimated that the true number of infections will be approximately  times higher than the number of confirmed cases.Speaking to MPs on Wednesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the real number of Omicron caseswas “probably closer to ,”.Delta cases had doubled in around seven days, he continued, but for Omicron “based on the latest data from here and around the world, our latest analysis is that it’s been around, it’s between two-and-a-half and three days”.  At the current observed doubling rate of two-and-a-half to three days, he estimated that cases could exceed one million by the end of the month. Meanwhile, new figures show London, eastern England and the South East are seeing their highest case rates since January. In the South East, a total of . new cases per , people were recorded in the week to  December - the highest since  January.

Many people were left without electricity after the storms cut cables during gales which were close to mph on Monday. Barraaposs effects are still being felt, with roads closed due to flooding in places such as Greater Manchester. While temperatures have been milder - they are now predicted to drop in the days ahead.  Weather maps from WXCharts suggest suggest snow could fall across northern Scotland on Thursday night and possibly into Friday morning. WXCharts is also showing a freezing weather system hitting the UK from December , due to air moving south from the Arctic and Scandinavia. The whole of Scotland, Wales, northern and central parts of England turn a shade of light blue on weather maps, meaning sub-zero temperatures for the evening of December  with the north of the country worst affected. The Met Office said there is a chance of rain and snow in high areas of the UK next week. Its long term forecast said: To begin the period, drier and clearer conditions are likely, allowing for more extensive frost and patchy fog.  Cloud and strong winds will travel east across the country, with a chance of showers or longer spells of rain for many. Hill snow likely in the north. Temperatures generally around average. Moving through the period, largely unsettled conditions are likely to persist, with the chance of further showers and longer spells of rain, heavy in places, with a chance of gales. Some showers are likely to turn wintry on hills at times.  Towards the end of the period, more settled conditions are likely to develop, most likely with milder temperatures, but a chance of some brief colder interludes.The BBC long-range weather forecast says Scotland and Northern Ireland “may continue to be impacted by Atlantic weather systems” during this period.The forecast says the conditions is being driven by an area of high pressure over Europe and low pressure from Iceland.Minimum temperature charts predict lows of C in the North, C in the South and C in Scotland overnight on December , the Express reported.But the latest windchill prediction from WXCharts suggests it will feel like C to-C. UK forecast for the next  days Today: Showers easing away northeastwards with many parts fine for a time, particularly the east. Rain ing to western parts by lunchtime then gradually moving eastwards. Becoming milder in southwest. Tonight: Band of rain clearing eastwards followed by scattered blustery showers. These most frequent in north and west with a risk of hail and thunder. Friday: Sunny spells and scattered showers, though some eastern areas probably staying dry. Showers heavy at times and most frequent in north and west with a risk of hail and thunder. Outlook for Saturday to Monday: Dry and frosty start to Saturday, but becoming wetter and milder from the west. Further rain and strong winds at times on Sunday and Monday.

Masks were already mandatory in some places, such as shops, supermarkets and on public transport, before Mr Johnson announced his aposPlan Bapos on Wednesday.Under the new measures, face coverings must now be worn in England in cinemas, hairdressers, theatres, places of worship, nail salons, massage centres, tattoo studios and some other settings. The NHS Covid Pass will be required for entry to nightclubs and venues with large crowds inside. People in England are also being advised to work from homethey can as part of a bid to drive down coronavirus cases. However, the good news is that families will still be able to come together for Christmas dinner and friends can gather at the pub for a festive drink. What are the new rules From December , face coverings must be worn in most public indoor settings in England, including cinemas, hairdressers, theatres and places of worship. It will also become the law to wear them in nail salons, massage centres, tattoo studios, pharmacies, vets, auction houses, retail galleries, takeaways , estate and lettings agents, high street solicitors, accountants and during driving tests and lessons, Under Plan B, the NHS Covid Pass will also become a requirement for entry to nightclubs and venues with large crowds inside from December . This includes unseated indoor events with  or more people and unseated outdoor venues with , or more iniduals present.New rules also say any contact of a suspected Omicron case must isolate for  days.  How is this dferent from the existing rules  Since November , it has been mandatory to wear masks in shops, supermarkets and on public transport but this rule has now been extended.The Prime Minister did not add any additional travel rules, although these were tightened last month. Arrivals in the UK from anywhere in the world are now forced to take a paid-for PCR test within  hours of their arrival. They must also isolate until the result comes back negative. Since December , people flying back to the UK are also required to take another pre-departure test before they board their flight. The NHS Covid Pass rule for nightclubs is also a sht, with people previously able to show a negative test to enter.  Can I still go to the pub and enjoy Christmas dinner with my family  Yes, pubs will remain open under the plans and you will be able to meet your loved ones for Christmas dinner. There is no indication that the Rule of Six will , meaning there are no limits on social gatherings inside or outside. Boris Johnson rejected the suggestion that festive parties and nativity plays should be cancelled during Wednesdayaposs Downing Street press conference. It means parties are allowed but office work is discouraged.Last Christmas the rules looked very dferent, with a tiered system of restrictions in place across England. People were told to stay at home in London, south-east and east England as they were placed in Tier . Households in other parts of the country were allowed to mix on December , although long-distance travel was discouraged. This year it looks like the rules will not be as strict, although the Prime Minister has refused to rule out a Christmas lockdown so there is still a chance things could change.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter When will Plan B end  The measures announced on Wednesday will be reviewed on January  and the government will update Parliament. Regulations will then “sunset” on January , Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs. But both of these days could be brought forward or pushed back so they’re not actually massively relevant.We can glean some information from the criteria for triggering Plan B in the first place.The government will likely base its decision to lt restrictions on the state of the NHS, the link between hospitalisation and infections, vaccine efficacy and immunity, and the impact of new iants.

Belle Parri, , cheated her own grieving siblings out of £, from the sale of her parents’ house. A court heard she planned on becoming a bar owner - and defrauded her sisters from their rightful inheritance. A family feud developed after her parents George and Linda Slack died within a fortnight of each other in . Parri had been named executor and trustee of their wills - and was obliged to ide the £, proceeds of a house sale up with her two sisters. But instead she transferred the property in Runcorn, Cheshire, into her own name and tried to remortgage it to buy a nightclub.  Prosecutor James Coutts said sisters Caroline Skye and Victoria Kennedy were conned out of thousands - along with four grandchildren who also stood to inherit smaller amounts. Mr Coutts said: “Instead she decided to buy a bar in Denbigh.” He said: “She told her family in no uncertain terms. This was something she was arranging the finance for herself. She assured them it was nothing to do with their parents’ house.” Caernarfon Crown Court heard Parri - known to her family as Alison - was discovered when another family member opened a letter from a finance company. Parri admitted four charges of fraud. Her sister Caroline said Parri had embarked on a “get rich quick scheme” which she had kept secret. She said: “I am determined to be free of her toxic influence.” Sister Victoria said the frauds were a “malignant effort by Alison to orce me from my family”. Speaking after the case, she added: “This is a very complex case.” She described Parri as “low, petty, jealous and controlling” and added: “She really is a piece of work”. Dafydd Roberts, defending, said the fraud was “putting a property at risk of loss, rather than loss.” Judge Nicola Saffman said Parri had show “an entire lack of remorse.” Parri, of Runcorn, was jailed for  months.

Rich German and Matt Wheaton were paddle boarding when they encountered an enormous sunfish. They were in the US city of Laguna Beach, Calornia when they made the freaky discovery.Mr German said: “My buddy, Matt, and I were just paddling and came across it… it was hard to miss! It was nine to  feet long, way bigger than myself.“It’s hard to compare a sunfish to other creatures because they are so bizarre looking – they look like a mutilated shark that got bitten in half. I’ve seen many over the years but this was definitely the biggest.”  The world’s largest bony fish by weight was another sunfish caught in  off Kamogawa – a city in Chiba, Japan, says the Guinness World Records. It weighed ,kg and measured ft in long – and though the two men didn’t measure the fish they encountered, they’re confident it was bigger. “Well we didn’t catch it or have a measuring tape but the largest sunfish on record is ft in,” said Rich, . “Matt’s board is ft long, he added, andyou look at the pics you can see for yourself how big it looks.  I would guess it was at least nine to  feet long… my buddy and I were blown away when we saw it.” Julianne Steers of Beach Ecology Coalition said there was only one way to say for sureit was a record-breaking specimen. “The only true way to know isit was out [of the water] and weighed and officially measured,” she told the OC Register. “But it does look much larger than what we typically see out here.”  Mr German, who founded Project O – a non-profit organisation dedicated to ocean conservation – has been out in the water almost every day for over a decade. But this encounter shows that, even for him, the sea still holds surprises. He said: “I’ve been paddling here in Laguna Beach pretty much every day for the past  years and I’ve had over , encounters with dolphins and whales. “This was more proof that you never know what you will see out on the ocean!” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON World recordsSharksDolphinsBig Fish\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Scientists may never catch up to this ever-evolving and elusive virus and iants.

If too much water gathers on the surface, you can end up with mould, which can be dangerous to your healththe problem isnapost solved.One woman who had this very problem took to Facebook to ask for advice. Sophie Randell made her plea for help in the Mrs Hinch Cleaning Tips group where she said sheaposs having condensation issues after moving into a new rented property.She said: Just moved into a rented property and without a fail every day the windows have condensation like this, I’ve tried the littlepots shown in the picture to help but it’s made zero dference.

It even leaks water onto the window seal some days from how much condensation there is. Group members rushed to share their tips, tricks and advice in the comments in the hopes of fixing Sophieaposs problem, with the most popular suggestion being salt, which costs only p in Asda for a large pot. One person said: Put salt in a bowl on the window sill. It will draw the damp to it. I’d recommend that too, wrote another. Buying a humidier was another popular option - but instead of splashing out on one right on top of Christmas, a third commented: Grab a big plastic tub and make your own dehumidier by putting cat litter or salt or even sugar in it - anything that will absorb moisture. A few people suggested that she open her windows in the morning for an hour or so and put the heating on, and this should sort the problem right out. If you find this makes the house too cold, you could just open them for five minutes a few times a day. Others also urged Sophie not to dry her clothes inside either, as this can make the problem worse.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Shannon Richardson, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, says her -month-old son Freddie had been inexplicably waking up every night around am and refusing to go back to sleep, leaving her and partner Jack Gray perplexed. However, the couple were horried to discover the aposexplanationapos - when they heard a aposdeep male voiceapos talking to little Freddie through the camera, which was so clear they thought someone was in the house at first. Racing into their sonaposs room, Jack ripped the aposhackedapos monitor out of the wall from where it had been positioned to film their youngster - before throwing it into a skip. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Shannon, , was left so scared that it could be a aposlocal manapos that she insisted on staying at her mumaposs house even after it had been thrown away and once home had Freddie stay in bed with her. Now the care assistant fears that the man could have been watching their son for weeks and even seeing the couple trying to calm him, with images on the monitor showing Jack climbing into the cot to try to sooth his son. Shannon said: The sickness, upset and disgust we feel is awful. How long has this creep been watching Freddieaposs room  We get him changed after bath times and put him to bed in there. We donapost know how long this has been going on for because, for a while, heaposd been waking up at the same time in the night at around am and we werenapost able to settle him. Jack was getting in the cot to try and comfort him. Weaposd been trying to settle him and nothing would work so we think someone was waking him up. But now weaposve removed the baby monitor, he hasnapost been waking up in the night. Images caught on the monitor show Jack, who works in fire and flood restoration, comforting his son in the cot in the middle of the night in the weeks leading up to the incident in October, to no avail. Shannon said: It was around .am and me and Jack were watching TV. We had the camera on and we heart rustling so we watched it for a minute thinking it was probably Freddie moving around in his cot. All of a sudden, we heard this really deep, male voice and it was so clear, we thought he was in the bedroom. He was saying aposbabyapos and aposbabaapos like he was trying to wake Freddie up. Jack ran upstairs and barged into Freddieaposs room. No one was in there but the monitor moved towards Jackaposs direction. The voice had come through the monitor. Jack just ripped the monitor out of the wall and picked Freddie up. We went into our bedroom and just sat there not knowing what to do. We were in shock. I didnapost know what to believe or to think. Shannon says the manaposs voice had been so clear that they thought someone was in the house and that the incident has left her feeling scared in her own home. Shannon said: Jack threw the monitor in a skip. I didnapost want to be in my house, I kept going to my mumaposs even though the monitor was gone. I didnapost feel comfortable and I was on edge. I was scared because we didnapost knowit was a local man. I wasnapost comfortable putting Freddie to bed on his own so he was sleeping in my bed with me but I had to eventually put him in his own bed so he didnapost get too used to being with me. Shannon had been given the video baby monitor as a gt while she was pregnant and had been using it ever since Freddie was born, Shannon said: I thought it was really handy because when he was in bed, it was nice to be able to see him. Weaposve been using it since he was born. Baby monitors are supposed to be a safe thing to watch your baby. You would never think that someone  would be watching them through it.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

She says it is where she is happiest, and after her most recent trip she looked back through her images and was shocked by what she saw. In the face of one wave, which rose up after splashing against a sea wall, she saw the likeness of God - specically as his son, Jesus, being one of his coeternal states as explained in the doctrine of the Holy Trinity. What do you think about Traceyaposs picture  Let us know in the comments...Tracey said: I have a relationship with the sea. I spend most of my time on the coast - Itaposs where I am happiest. I love watching the waves and I love taking photographs. Combining the two is my idea of heaven. I noticed due to high tide and effects of Storm Barra, the waves were splashing against the steps that lay horizontally to the beach, almost along its full . The waves were quite big at times. I took lots of photos but it wasnapost until I was going through them to find one or two to put on social media that I came across this image with God in it. I was so excited. I feel really blessed. Tracey says that some who have viewed the picture she took at Oddicombe Beach have also likened it to Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, or Neptune, the Roman god of fresh water.

Gene Guglielmi did a double-take when he spotted an unusual figure in his freshly-peeled tangerine, with the care home worker left reeling at the resemblance the iconic outline had to the Messiah. The -year-old was stunned by the visage of Jesus that he spotted hanging from two citrus segments while he took a break at work. He scrambled to take pictures of the citrusy saviour - which show the fruity figure from dferent angles with a clearly defined head, slender torso and arms outstretched.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer mission, or IXPE, began at am on Thursday with hopes of gaining new insight into some of the most extreme objects in the universe. Space enthusiasts can watch live coverage of the launch on NASA TV and the agencyaposs website. The satellite set off into the sky aboard a SpaceX Falcon  rocket from NASAaposs Kennedy Space Centre in Florida. Nasa confirmed IXPE began its orbit around Earth at an altitude of around  miles. The spacecraft separation took place  minutes into the flight and unfurled its solar arrays around one minute later. Lead investigator Martin Weisskopf said: “It is an indescribable feeling to see something you’ve worked on for decades become real and launch into space.  “This is just the beginning for IXPE. We have much work ahead. But tonight, we celebrate. Mr Weisskopf came up with the idea for the spacecraft and has conducted experiments in X-ray astronomy since the s. Three state of the art telescopes are onboard the spacecraft which is a collaborative effort of NASA and the Italian Space Agency. The technology works by measuring X-rays released by black holes and neutron stars, a term which refers to the collapsed centres of supergiant stars. IXPE is not as big as NASAaposs Chandra X-ray observatory but big hopes are resting on the mission.  Space experts say the satellite will reveal more information on cosmic rays which move through space at almost the speed of light. Thomas Zurbuchen, an associate administrator at NASA Headquarters in Washington, said: “IXPE represents another extraordinary first. “Together with our partners in Italy and around the world, we’ve added a new space observatory to our fleet that will shape our understanding of the universe for years to come. Each NASA spacecraft is carefully chosen to target brand new observations enabling new science, and IXPE is going to show us the violent universe around us – such as exploding stars and the black holes at the centre of galaxies – in ways we’ve never been able to see it.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NasaItalian Space AgencySpace\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

People aged  and under in  will never be allowed to purchase cigarettes in the Pacic country of five million, part of proposals unveiled on Thursday that will also curb the number of retailers authorised to sell tobacco and cut nicotine levels in all products. “We want to make sure young people never start smoking so we will make it an offence to sell or supply smoked tobacco products to new cohorts of youth,” New Zealand Associate Minister of Health Ayesha Verrall said in a statement. “If nothing changes, it would be decades till Māori smoking rates fall below %, and this government is not prepared to leave people behind.” How will New Zealandaposs smoking ban for young people work  Currently, .% of all New Zealanders aged over  smoke, a proportion that rises to % among indigenous Maori adults, according to government figures. The government will consult with a Maori health task force in the coming months before introducing legislation into parliament in June next year, with the aim of making it law by the end of .  The restrictions would then be rolled out in stages from , beginning with a sharp reduction in the number of authorised sellers, followed by reduced nicotine requirements in  and the creation of the “smoke-free” generation from . The package of measures will make New Zealand’s retail tobacco industry one of the most restricted in the world, just behind Bhutan where cigarette sales are banned outright. New Zealand’s neighbour Australia was the first country in the world to mandate plain packaging of cigarettes in . The New Zealand government said while existing measures like plain packaging and levies on sales had slowed tobacco consumption, the tougher steps were necessary to achieve its goal of fewer than % of the population smoking daily by . The new rules would halve the country’s smoking rates in as few as  years from when they take effect, the government said. Smoking kills about , people a year in New Zealand, making it one of the country’s top causes of preventable death. Four in five smokers started before age , the country’s government said. Vaping, often seen as a safer alternative to smoking and a useful aid to quitting, is also tightly regulated with sales only allowed to over s. Health authorities welcomed the crackdown, while retailers and tobacco companies expressed concern about the impact on their businesses and warned of the emergence of a black market. “We welcome the New Zealand government’s recognition that excessive excise increases disproportionately impact smokers on lower incomes,” tobacco group Imperial Brands said, adding it was concerned about proposals to reduce nicotine levels and eventually prohibit sales. “Prohibitions of any kind tend to play into the hands of criminal traders who peddle unregulated illicit products,” it also said. Dunhill maker British American Tobaccoand Marlboro maker Philip Morris, which has previously said it would stop sales in the countryrequired by law, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  According to brokerage Citi, BAT is the market leader in New Zealand, with a % share by volume, while Imperial Brands, which sells JPS, Riverstone and Horizon cigarettes, accounts for %, generating about -% of its group earnings before taxes. The government did not detail how the new rules would be policed or whether they would apply to visitors to the country. “Cigarette smoking kills  New Zealanders every day and two out of three smokers will die as a result of smoking,” said New Zealand Medical Association chair Alistair Humphrey in a statement. “This action plan offers some hope of realising our  Smokefree Aotearoa goal, and keeping our tamarikismokefree.” However, the Dairy and Business Owners Group, a lobby group for local convenience stores, said while it supported a smoke-free country, the government’s plan would destroy many businesses. “This is all  per cent theory and zero per cent substance,” the group’s chairman, Sunny Kaushal, told Stuff.co.nz. “There’s going to be a crime wave. Gangs and criminals will fill the gap with ciggie houses alongside tinnie houses.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Philip Morris InternationalBritish American Tobacco plcNew Zealand Medical AssociationCrimeSmokingPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Five attackers showed up at the four-star Oasis Palm hotel in Cancun, Mexico on jet skis before opening fire, Lucio Hernández Gutiérrez, the chief of police of the coastal state of Quintana Roo, said. The jet skis were found a mile away on a beach and seized. Rick Lebassa, an American tourist who witnessed the terrying attack, said two or three gunmen appeared to be shooting into the air with pistols. He said: “There were two guys and maybe even a third, who came in on jet skis, and what I saw was them shooting up into the sky.  “I did not see any shots coming in toward the shoreline.” Andy Guyrich and Kerry Arms, who were also visiting from the US, described the scene. He said: “We just had to hit the deck.” Kerry added: “There was a delayed reaction for about maybe five seconds, then everybody started scrambling and screaming and crying, and running. The terrying shooting is the latest in a series of incidents in the tourist hotspot in the same week.  Footage shows a special battalion of National Guard troops patrolling the beach after they were assigned to protect the area. They are seen with bulletproof vests, helmets and assault rles while walking through the crowded beach. It comes after how hero hotel guests brandished poles as a rain of gunfire killed two near a Day of the Dead party in Mexico.  The rain of bullets caused hotel guests to run for cover after a fight broke out between drug gangs on a beach at the Hyatt Ziva Riviera resort. Former NBC executive Mike Sington, who is staying at the resort told how guests were relaxing on the beach and playing volleyball when the incident happened.He posted on Twitter : Guests are telling me they were playing volleyball on the beach, gunman approached firing gun. The holiday horror saw some guests run for cover, but others grabbed poles ready to defend themselves against the cartel attack. One tourist told CNN: I was by the pool when multiple successive gunshots occurred. It went on for a little while and everyone dove for cover. We manned the entrances to the basement and were given metal sticks, even a pedestal bathroom sink, to defend ourselves.

Stephanie Browitt, , was with her sister Krystal, , and dad Paul, when a volcano erupted on the coast of Whakatane on New Zealand’s North Island on December , . Stephanie survived with third-degree burns to  per cent of her body but her sister and Paul were killed along with  other people on the island at the time. Her mother Marie had stayed behind on the Ovation of the Seas cruise ship and watched on helplessly as tragedy struck. Stephanie, who now wears a protective face mask, posted photos of her family on Thursday to mark the occasion.  She wrote: “Today marks two years since the incident my family and I were a part of. The day that ripped us apart. For a lot of burn survivors they call it their “burnversary”, a day where they can celebrate their achievements, accomplishments and the fact that they survived such awful tragedy’s on this very date. “I truly want to celebrate all that I have accomplished since I was severely burnt, just like other burn survivors do.  “Unfortunately today’s not only the day I survived the unimaginable, it’s the day I lost my dad, Paul and sister, Krystal. It’s the day that they were taken from us.” Stephanie, who has become an advocate for burns survivors since the incident, said her accomplishments mean nothing” when she cannot share them with her lost loved ones. She continued: “Everyday I question why we couldn’t have gone through this extremely hard journey together, why they couldn’t be here also.  “I’m extremely grateful that I was able to make it back home to my mum, but I’m also heartbroken that only I made it back. We are a family of four, not two. “My heart hurts when I remember what I felt that day, but it hurts more not knowing what my dad and sister felt, that I wasn’t next to them during their last moments.” She described the past two years as a period of “loss, pain and never ending grief” and said she missed her dad and sister every day “so much it kills me”.  In November , New Zealand’s workplace safety watchdog charged  parties - including tour operators and the island’s owners - with failings. All defendants have pleaded not guilty but they could be liable for millions of dollars in fines.

been more aggressive in their course of treatment, an independent expert has said.Coco Rose Bradford died on July   after being admitted to the Royal Cornwall Hospital, known as Treliske Hospital, with severe vomiting and diarrhoea on July .She was initially discharged only to be readmitted overnight on July  when her symptoms worsened.Coco was eventually transferred to the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, where she later died.Blood tests showed Coco had ldquooverwhelming sepsis by the time she was transferred.An inquest sitting in Truro is considering whether a dferent course of treatment may have saved her le.A review published in September  found Treliske staff ldquomissed opportunities in Cocorsquos care, including by failing to recognise Coco was in shock and administering an inadequate fluid management plan.vw,vw,px, px\"Coco Rose Bradford developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome It further found there had been a delay to starting antibiotics overnight on July  when Cocorsquos test results showed she had developed sepsis.Dr Yincent Tse, a consultant paediatric nephrologist at Great North Childrenrsquos Hospital in Newcastle Upon Tyne, said on Thursday he did not believe Coco could have been saved.The inquest previously heard Coco had developed haemolytic uraemic syndromendash a rare condition triggered by E.coli that causes the destruction of red blood cells.Giving evidence to the inquest, Dr Tse explained that HUS is caused by the toxins given off by the bacteria that get into the blood stream and causes the platelets to clot in the small blood vessels.It mainly impacts the kidneys but can also affect other organs, including the brain ndash particularly in children ndash causing them to become confused and, in some cases, cause seizures.HUS can also cause tissue death in the brain, resulting in serious brain damage..removeThere is no proven treatment for the condition, Dr Tse said, but there is evidence it is ldquoself-limiting, meaning it can run its course on its own.Antibiotics are not recommended, the inquest heard, because they can cause the E.coli bacteria to release its toxins, worsening the disease.Left to itself, there is the possibility the E.coli might pass out naturally.The inquest also heard doctors decided to give Coco half the level of fluids recommended by the National Institute of Care Excellencebecause of concerns about kidney damage.vw,vw,px, px\"There was a delay moving Coco from a general paediatric ward to the intensive care unit Dr Tse said: ldquoI think it is a reasonable course of action because while you can give halfyou canrsquot take away half, andthere is kidney shutdown there is a worry that the lungs will start filling up with fluidyou give too much.He said it was reasonable for doctors to have given Coco half the levels of fluid and then reassess her, adding: ldquoI think thatrsquos quite good practice.Dr Tse was askedit would have changed the outcomeCoco had been admitted on July  and given ldquooptimal fluids instead of being sent home.He replied: ldquoUnfortunately, because there is no treatment for the HUS toxin or the disease itself, I donrsquot think that would have made a dference.There was also a delay moving Coco from a general paediatric ward to the intensive care unit.Dr Tse again did not believe this would have saved her le.ldquoAlthough her perfusionwasnrsquot very good, she eventually, after a few hours of delay, got the treatment that she needed, he said.ldquoBut despite that, over the next few days inwith maximum support, she continued to deteriorate.He continued: ldquoI think, sadly, this was going to happen.Dr Tse was asked whether he believed medics should have given antibiotics at the point it was clear Coco had sepsis.He replied: ldquoI would share the hesitation in giving antibiotics, however I think thatat the timethink giving antibiotics might be helpful because of developing sepsis, I think that any nephrologist would go along with that.Another failing identied by the independent review into Cocorsquos death was that her blood pressure was not taken until  hours after she was admitted to hospital.The inquest heard that Coco, who was autistic and had limited speech, had become very distressed at having the cuff placed on her and nurses had been unable to take a reading.It has emerged the hospitalrsquos specialist learning disability and autism service were never called upon to help.The inquest will hear the final evidence on Friday, with Coroner Andrew Cox due to

requested for the East Coast Main Line crossing but was defeated by eight votes to three.The committee then approved the plans by  votes to one with only Councillor Findlay against.A further

The investors claim that ldquorenewables and networks are intrinsically dferent businesses with inidual funding needs, growth profiles and strategic priorities. The article goes on to say the combination of renewables and network assets is depriving shareholders of pound billion value because they do not belong together.I find this cynical prioritising of shareholder value over the engineering and ultimately the consumer interests in efficiency, security and cost control deeply upsetting. The strategic priority is to recognise that the integration of generation and network is a real-time absolute and demands engineering discipline. Anything which intervenes to confound this fact can only lead to increased risk and costs to the consumer.This highlights all the problems of establishing a viable secure and efficient public electricity supply when it is being controlled by bankers rather than engineers.The establishment of a National Energy Authority is an urgent priority.Norman McNab, Killearn.NO MORAL SUPERIORITYBOB Ballantynecannot be allowed to get away with his claim that,the father of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and his partner ldquohad been religious, they ldquocould not possibly have carried out the boyrsquos ill treatment and murder. He should try telling that to the many victims of physical and sexual child abuse when in the care of schools or other institutions run by religious orders.The truth is that those who choose to belong to a religion are no better than those of us who do not. Clearly people have every right to choose to believe in a god, or gods, and to try to live their own lives under the rules of their chosen religion. But they have no credibilitythey try to imply, as Mr Ballantyne does, that they are somehow better people than those of us who live in a more rational world.

The Scottish Government via Transport Scotland have funded around half the £. million costs.The council’s head of marine services, transportation and harbour master, Jim Buck, is confident that the new m modern fibre glass vessel will have been worth the wait.“We are delighted to be able to announce the start date for the Nordic Sea. The Golden Mariana has served the communities well, but it’s time now for a younger, more comfortable vessel to take over. At m, with a m beam, the Nordic Sea will be able to carry  passengers and is capable of running at between - knots, which is a little faster than the Golden Mariana. She has stabilisers installed to help with the motion and is a much more luxurious vessel for passengers and, very importantly, is fully accessible for those who require this.”The ship has attracted plenty of speculation, after long periods of being tied up since being purchased in April . COVID delayed a £, refit programme, and further complicating matters has been the retirement of the previous skipper of the Golden Mariana and the longer-than-anticipated recruitment process for crew to serve on the Nordic Sea.Mr Buck went on to explain why the process has taken longer than some had expected.“It would appear to have taken a long time but actually in respect of the certication process when taking a vessel from one country to another it has actually been remarkably quick. She is the first vessel of her type to go through that process and with that comes inevitable hurdles that need to be overcome. The Nordic Sea had a series of modications made to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication standard.“She was built to a dferent specication so had to go through the required checks and balances to ensure we met the current specications for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s current passenger vessel system.”He is confident that she will be a favourable addition to the fleet.“She is a really good sea keeping vessel with good properties designed with the right centre of height for that comfortable ride.”Councillor David Dawson, chair of the board of Orkney Ferries, said: “I would like to recognise the efforts of the team here in Orkney for getting us to this stage, particularly given the challenges added in by the pandemic, but also for the patience of the people of Papay. We must not forget the faithful service of the Golden Mariana and crew who have served the communities well.“From the information I have received from seagoing staff who have taken the Nordic Sea out in what could be described as ‘challenging conditions’, I have every confidence that the Papay community will not be disappointed in what is a first-class vessel.“We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland to enable the purchase of the vessel and are looking forward to the inaugural journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As such, it is urging people to defer such parties at this time.In a statement issued this evening, Dr Nick Phin, Public Health Scotland#s director of public health science and medical director, said: “There is much that we still need to learn about Omicron, but early evidence suggests that this new COVID iant is much more transmissible.#The impact of this transmissibility has been seen in recent weeks, with a number of Omicron outbreaks linked to parties.“We still need to learn more about the severity of disease caused by Omicron and the effectiveness of vaccines, but there are important things that we can do to help protect ourselves and our families now. To help minimise the further spread of COVID-, and Omicron in particular, I would strongly urge people to defer their Christmas parties to another time.“I appreciate that everyone is keen to celebrate this festive season, particularly after the pressures of the last twenty months, but by postponing some plans we can all do our bit to protect ourselves and our loved ones.”Public Health Scotland has also issued a reminder of the other measures we can all take to continue to keep safe over the festive period:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In an update to the Scottish Parliament this Tuesday afternoon, she explained that the nation#s coronavirus restrictions are to be reviewed on a daily basis in the wake of an increasing number of Omicron cases.She has urged everyone across Scotland to stick closely to the guidelines. This included strict guidance to employers with staff who can fulfil their duties from home and testing before mixing with people from other houses.These changes come as Orkney recorded seven cases over the past  hours, according to the daily figures published by the Scottish Government. This has brought the county#s total to .On the new restrictions, the First Minister said: “To be blunt,you had staff working from home at the start of the pandemic, please now enable them to do so again.##I#m asking you to do this from now, until the middle of January, when we will review this advice again.#She also said: #Test and Protect is deploying enhanced contact tracing for all cases with the s-gene drop-out that is indicative of Omicron. For these cases, household contacts of close contacts, rather than just the close contacts themselves are being asked to test and isolate.#For non-Omicron cases,you have COVID symptoms you are being urged to book a PCR test and self-isolate until you receive the result. If the result is negative, you can end isolationyou are double vaccinatedit is positive, you must isolate for the full ten days.Ms Sturgeon has also asked everyone to test #regularly and repeatedly# with lateral flow device test.#We are asking everyone to do a lateral flow test before mixing with people from other households — and on every occasion you intend doing so. That means before going to a pub, a restaurant, visiting anybody #s house, or even going shopping.#Concluding, the First Minister said: #If we do all of these things, dficult though I appreciate they are, even with a more transmissible iant, I do really hope we can avoid the need for any further measures.

No changes to the current rules were made but the administration, in a joint statement, emphasised the need for compliance with existing measures.Mr Givan and deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill have both expressed hope that no further restrictions will be required before Christmas. vw,vw,px, px\"First Minister Paul Givan receives his Covid- booster jab at Lisburn Primary and Community Care Centre Stormontrsquos leaders were commenting as they visited Lagan Valley Hospital ahead of the Executive meeting.During the visit Mr Givan received his Covid- booster jab at the Lisburn Primary and Community Care Centre.Northern Irelandrsquos booster programme has now opened up to people aged - who had their second dose of a vaccine less than six months ago.Mr Givan, who is in that new cohort, stressed the importance of ramping up booster rates to bolster the populationrsquos immunity ahead of the inevitable spread of Omicron in the region.The DUP minister said Northern Ireland is ldquobehind the curve when compared with the case numbers being recorded in England and Scotland and should be able to ldquoget through the next number of weeks before the new iant becomes dominant in the region.I was able to get my booster jab this morning at Lagan Valley Hospital.

Read the thread ## #ScotBudget pic OiLYFvxbmdash Scottish GovernmentDecember , Meanwhile pound million will be used to fund the introduction of free bus travel for those aged under  from January, with pound million being used to expand free school lunches to all children in the first five years of primary school.Another pledge will see pound million going to affordable housing, with Ms Forbes insisting that this and other measures will ldquomake a big dference.While Ms Forbes said herBudget would address the ldquokey priorities of tackling poverty, supporting the economy and dealing with climate change, she conceded it was a ldquoBudget of choices ndash adding there were some areas where she would have wished to spend more.Despite the Scottish Government having been awarded the largest ever block grant from Westminster, the loss of specic Covid funding means Holyrood ministers have less to spend next year.Ms Forbes said: ldquoWith Covid funding having been removed, our day-to-day funding next year is signicantly less compared to the current year, at a time when we undeniably need to invest in the economy and help public services recover.She also told MSPs Brexit had had an impact too, saying: ldquoThe Budget Irsquom presenting today is smaller than it would beit wasnrsquot for the impact of Brexit on our economy ndasha Brexit that has been imposed on Scotland against the express wish of the people that live here.But with the last two Budgets having been drawn up to deal with the ldquoimmediate experiences of Covid, Ms Forbes said with this package of measures she was looking to ldquolt our eyes to the future, while of course remaining vigilant to the effects of new iants.She said: ldquoThis is a transitional Budget, as people, businesses and services get back on their feet.To help hard-pressed families dealing with rising costs, she made little change to income tax rates in Scotland.The thresholds for the lowest two tax bands ndash the starter rate and the basic rate ndash will be increased in line inflation, with the amount people have to earn before starting to pay the intermediate, higher and top rates frozen.ldquoOur progressive Scottish income tax policy means the majority of Scottish tax payers will continue to pay less income tax thanthey lived where in the UK, while those who earn more will pay more, the Finance Secretary saidSpeaking about the Budget package overall, Ms Forbes said: ldquoTodayrsquos Budget is a Budget of choices, and we have chosen to tackle child poverty, to invest in the transition to net zero and to boost economic prosperity.ldquoIt delivers on our manesto promises ndash more teachers, more funding for our police and record investment in our health and social care services, as we stand united against the impacts of Covid .ldquoIt is a Budget for households facing a cost of living crisis, targeting resources at low income families and making bold choices to address the devastating impact of child poverty.ldquoIt is a Budget for a net zero future, that once again shows Scotland leading from the front, in the defining mission of our generation.Scottish Conservative finance spokeswoman Liz Smith highlighted the ldquorecord block grant funding Ms Forbes had received from Chancellor Rishi Sunak and the UK Government.Saying this was up by .%, she added it proved ldquothe benefits of Scotland being part of a strong United Kingdom ndash something which she said was ldquoneeded now more than ever.Labour finance spokesman Daniel Johnson said it was ldquoright for the NHS to get the ldquobulk of the funding, but he called on the Scottish Government to pay social care staff pound an hour.Mr Johnson said: ldquoChallenging times require bold action. But rather than rising to the challenge this Budget is just more managed decline under the SNP.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton also argued the pay increase for care staff wouldnot deliver ldquothe transformational change we need.With Ms Forbes also having pledged public sector wage rises of pound for those earning less than pound, a year, pound for those on pound, to pound, and pound for those earning more than this, the Lib Dem added this would be a real terms pay cut for ldquoteachers, nurses and many thousands of public sector workers.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

aggressive in their course of treatment, an independent expert has said.Coco Rose Bradford died on July   after being admitted to the Royal Cornwall Hospital, known as Treliske Hospital, with severe vomiting and diarrhoea on July .She was initially discharged only to be readmitted overnight on July  when her symptoms worsened.Coco was eventually transferred to the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, where she later died.Blood tests showed Coco had ldquooverwhelming sepsis by the time she was transferred.An inquest sitting in Truro is considering whether a dferent course of treatment may have saved her le.A review published in September  found Treliske staff ldquomissed opportunities in Cocorsquos care, including by failing to recognise Coco was in shock and administering an inadequate fluid management plan. vw,vw,px, px\"Coco Rose Bradford developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome It further found there had been a delay to starting antibiotics overnight on July  when Cocorsquos test results showed she had developed sepsis.Dr Yincent Tse, a consultant paediatric nephrologist at Great North Childrenrsquos Hospital in Newcastle Upon Tyne, said on Thursday he did not believe Coco could have been saved.The inquest previously heard Coco had developed haemolytic uraemic syndromendash a rare condition triggered by E.coli that causes the destruction of red blood cells.Giving evidence to the inquest, Dr Tse explained that HUS is caused by the toxins given off by the bacteria that get into the blood stream and causes the platelets to clot in the small blood vessels.It mainly impacts the kidneys but can also affect other organs, including the brain ndash particularly in children ndash causing them to become confused and, in some cases, cause seizures.HUS can also cause tissue death in the brain, resulting in serious brain damage.There is no proven treatment for the condition, Dr Tse said, but there is evidence it is ldquoself-limiting, meaning it can run its course on its own.Antibiotics are not recommended, the inquest heard, because they can cause the E.coli bacteria to release its toxins, worsening the disease.Left to itself, there is the possibility the E.coli might pass out naturally.The inquest also heard doctors decided to give Coco half the level of fluids recommended by the National Institute of Care Excellencebecause of concerns about kidney damage. vw,vw,px, px\"There was a delay moving Coco from a general paediatric ward to the intensive care unit Dr Tse said: ldquoI think it is a reasonable course of action because while you can give halfyou canrsquot take away half, andthere is kidney shutdown there is a worry that the lungs will start filling up with fluidyou give too much.He said it was reasonable for doctors to have given Coco half the levels of fluid and then reassess her, adding: ldquoI think thatrsquos quite good practice.Dr Tse was askedit would have changed the outcomeCoco had been admitted on July  and given ldquooptimal fluids instead of being sent home.He replied: ldquoUnfortunately, because there is no treatment for the HUS toxin or the disease itself, I donrsquot think that would have made a dference.There was also a delay moving Coco from a general paediatric ward to the intensive care unit.Dr Tse again did not believe this would have saved her le.ldquoAlthough her perfusionwasnrsquot very good, she eventually, after a few hours of delay, got the treatment that she needed, he said.ldquoBut despite that, over the next few days inwith maximum support, she continued to deteriorate.He continued: ldquoI think, sadly, this was going to happen.Dr Tse was asked whether he believed medics should have given antibiotics at the point it was clear Coco had sepsis.He replied: ldquoI would share the hesitation in giving antibiotics, however I think thatat the timethink giving antibiotics might be helpful because of developing sepsis, I think that any nephrologist would go along with that.Another failing identied by the independent review into Cocorsquos death was that her blood pressure was not taken until  hours after she was admitted to hospital.The inquest heard that Coco, who was autistic and had limited speech, had become very distressed at having the cuff placed on her and nurses had been unable to take a reading.It has emerged the hospitalrsquos specialist learning disability and autism service were never called upon to help.The inquest will hear the final evidence on Friday, with Coroner Andrew Cox due to deliver his conclusions on a date yet to be set.We want

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1638984916407.jpg--covid_19___wed_8th_december_figures.jpg?1638984916000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211208newscovid 19 wed 8th december figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows five further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

The Sweeney’s have other fund raisers in mind for the New Year, including a Tractor Run - in memory of their late tractor loving son Alexander.With tears welling up in both parents eyes they recalled how their world was turned upside down after getting the news that little Alexander had an incurable condition, giving him just months to live.In November last year Alexander took a stroke and seizures, and was in an induced coma for  days.Tests were taken and the le shattering news that Alexander had in incurable condition was was given to Lisa and Jason. Alexander, at just three years of age, passed away on July  this year.“We said at the time that we will be trying to raise as much money as possible to give to the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice,” outlined Lisa.“They were absolutely amazing and need all the support they can get.”Both parents agreed that the public are not aware of the work carried out by the staff at NI Hospice.“The Hospice helped us get through a very dficult time. They supported us and gave us respite when we really needed it. In Alexander’s last days the Hospice staff worked very hard. We know we could not have got through without their excellent backing. We say a very special thank you for everything they did. Words cannot really describe just how good their were. We are, and always will be, most grateful to them,” outlined Lisa.Alexander’s condition deteriorated towards the end of June this year - and in the end Hospice staff worked one-to-one making things as comfortable as possible for him.At present the Halax Bank in Bryan Street in the town, where Lisa works, are organising a collection for Hospice.“People have been very kind. We are very grateful to every single person who has donated. All the money raised is going to a very worthy cause,” said Lisa.And special thanks also go to their friends, Mark and Lesley McCaughan, of Follow Coffee in Greenvale Street who organised a Supper Club which raised pound, for the ‘Alexander Tribute Fund’.And the chefs, Phil Tynan and Jason McCartney, along with the staff worked flat out, free to charge, to make the fund raiser a success.There were six courses - and on the night there were  covers !A special menu was put together - The GardenThe Lough  The FarmThe EarthThe Orchardand The Forest .It went down very well with all who participated.  There was also a raffle with local businesses weighing in with their support - Ultimate Fashions, Blossom and Birch, Castle Bar and Grill , Toome Eel Fishery, and Follow Coffee.“Again the support was magnicent.

Pupils have to leave the bathroom to go and ask for them,” she said.“There is a requirement for these products to be available in toilets and that’s what we’re asking for.

In Northern Ireland it’s over %.” No cost has yet been put on the cost of any scheme to provide period products in all schools and public buildings, which Homeless Period Belfast say is a basic human right, with MLAs estimating the total bill for providing products could run over £ million.“Can you really put a cost on health needs,” Ms O’Donnell asked MLAs. “Having a period is not a choice. This is a human rights and equality issue as well as a health issue.”While saying she was in support of a plan to provide products, DUP committee member Diane Dodds MLA stressed it would be “very important” to have a business rationale behind it. “We do not want barriers to education,” she said. “This is incredibly important, but we need to explore the costing issues.”Katie Bryce, from Homeless Period Belfast, said the results of a recent survey of girls carried out by the organisation showed % agreed that period products should be available freely in schools.“Some % told us they had left school early or missed a day because period products were not available,” she told MLAs. “Figures like that show the impact this can have on educational underachievement.“A further % told us they had to ask a teacher for products and % said the lack of availability negatively impacted their attention in class. Almost all, %, said they had just used toilet roll instead.”Also giving evidence to the committee, Grace Boyle, from the Students’ Union at Ulster University, said students had started their own Period Poverty Action Group several years ago, and the uptake of provision had been enormous.“The service we have managed to provide had been very widely used,” she told MLAs. “But we need to extend the service to other locations.“By the time girls reach university age, they are already used to putting their own pads together, but there’s no doubt there’s a real and pressing need for this bill, and we need to make products freely and widely available to hep remove the stigma and embarrassment many still feel.”Northern Ireland remains out on its own in being the only part of the UK not to have a permanent scheme in place to tackle period poverty.If the bill, which is currently passing through the Assembly legislative process, is adopted, it would create a legal right of free access to items such as tampons and sanitary pads.Bill sponsor Mr Catney said: “This is an absolute indictment on our history of mistreatment, discrimination and under representation of women and girls and their issues.”The committee stage of the bill is due to continue until February.Most ReadNorth Down landowner anger as Stormont department set to list World War Two artillery gun house in his gardenNI taxi driver handed suspended sentence after sharing sex act video in WhatsApp groupUlster Rugby must clary its position on Kingspan sponsorship, says Baroness HoeyNorthern Ireland Spend Local card deadline extended for second timeMichael O’Neill explains ‘respectful’ anthem compromise that his Northern Ireland teams reachedTop VideosPlayVideo: Armed Police swoop through balcony after  hour stand-off in BelfastPlayWatch: Passengers given sick bags as flight attempts to land at Dublin Airport during Storm BarraPlayFirst Minister and Deputy First encourage people to take up both doses of the Covid- vaccine and the booster dose when eligible.Latest EducationNI classroom assistants ‘under pressure’ to plug teaching gapsFlexible school starting age in Northern Ireland could be available from next yearCall for urgent change to address school unorm costNI teachers #in tears# dealing with Covid crisis in schoolsBrain drain blamed on Northern Ireland’s political ideLatestActor Adrian Dunbar lines up for event tackling mental health issuesLeicester crash out of Europa League after defeat in NapoliNew rules allow for masks to be removed to sing only‘reasonably necessary’Executive urges public to take lateral flow tests twice a week coming up to Christmas to combat spread of Omicron iantRose Ayling-Ellis calls Strictly dance partner Giovanni Pernice ‘sweaty’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

date, decision makers will need to consider response measures urgently to reduce transmissionthe aim is to reduce the likelihood of unsustainable pressure on the NHS.Early verbal reports indicate that hospitalisations due to Omicron are now increasing in South Africa and the spread of Omicron in the UK appears to be following a similar trajectory to that seen in South Africa.The doubling time for new Omicron infections is currently around three days and is thought to be no slower than a five-day doubling time.Very rapid doubling times leading to a large wave would result in signicant absences from work.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreMore Covid restrictions for Northern Ireland being considered to tackle Omicron iantNo pre-existing conditions in % of Covid deaths in Northern IrelandHOSPITALISATIONS: The overall scale of any wave of hospitalisations without interventions is highly uncertain, but the peak could reach several times the current level.With  Covid-occupied beds in Northern Ireland reported on Thursday, that means there could be up to  patients hospitalised with the virus by the peak.In order to be below this level, there would need to be a very high protection from boosters against Omicron and a small degree of immune escape, Sage has said.Read MoreSinn Fein’s John O’Dowd attends Craigavon hospital due to Covid-HOW IT COMPARES TO DELTA: Reports of superspreader events around the world, some of which involved Omicron, suggest the danger of airborne transmission of Omicron is greater than with pre-existing iants, such as Delta.As a result, experts at Sage have said “measures to reduce airborne spread such as ventilation, well-fitting masks and distancing or reduced density of people in indoor environments may be even more important”.The likelihood of transmission in hospitals is also “likely to be an even greater risk as a result of Omicron”.Measures will need to be put in place to reduce the risk of healthcare workers becoming infected, while measures in other vulnerable settings such as prisons and care homes should also be considered.Read MoreCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Four further deaths and , casesHOW QUICKLY IT CAN INFECT: The generation time for Omicron is not known, but Sage has considered the possibility that it is shorter than Delta, which it said, “would mean that case-based interventions, for example finding and isolating cases through contact tracing, become less effective because people become infectious sooner”.If this is the case, population-based public health measures, such as face coverings and social distancing, will be even more important than measures that pertain only to those who are confirmed as being infected.HOW QUICKLY WE NEED TO ACT: Hospital admissions will continue to increase for a number of weeks after measures to reduce transmission are put in place.“This is due to the lags between measures being introduced, these measures affecting incidence of infections, and then this being reflected in hospitalisations,” said Sage.The faster the growth in infections at the point measures are introduced, the more admissions will increase in the period between action being taken and the number of admissions being affected.Sage estimates that with a doubling rate of three days, once hospitalisations begin to increase at a rate similar to that of cases, there could be a -fold increase in Covid cases in the system before interventions to slow infections are reflected in Covid inpatients.Most ReadNorth Down landowner anger as Stormont department set to list World War Two artillery gun house in his

The firm is now being examined as part of an inquiry into how Grenfell Tower came to be coated in flammable materials which contributed to the spread of flames.However, Kingspan said it “played no role in the design of the cladding system on Grenfell Tower” where its product “constituted approximately % of the insulation and was used as a substitute product without Kingspan’s knowledge in a system that was not compliant with the building’s regulations”.Ulster Rugby has repeatedly told the Belfast  that it will not be making any comment in relation to its corporate relationship with Kingspan whilst the Grenfell Tower inquiry is ongoing.

Heartwarmingly enough I have people who say the season doesn#t begin till it starts.“One person on Twitter has pretty much reserved picking the film on st December every year now.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up It’s a special time of the year for Andrew who said he was lucky to grow up with such generous parents who gave their children “such great memories over the years”.Like most of us, a particular gt stands out: a Super Nintendo he was given in .“These days my favourite part of Christmas is being able to take two weeks off to spend with family and friends eating, drinking and generally relaxing, which definitely includes watching a lot of films and TV,” he said.Everyone has a Christmas film that resonates with them and they come in many guises.Some favour the classics others believe they have to contain Santa to be truly festive certain films are just on the TV schedule every year like Back to the Future and Harry Potter while a shoot-em-up like Die Hard reigns supreme in some households – there is a Christmas Eve party after all… amidst the gunfire and explosions.For Andrew, the best are often those that give a bit of hope, redemption or triumph. He said: “Be it James Stewart at the end of It#s A Wonderful Le running through the streets realising his world hasn#t ended, Scrooge realising the error of his ways in The Muppet Christmas Carol, to even Bruce Willis overcoming the bad guys by the end of Die Hard.“Christmas means so many things to dferent people. It can be as straightforward as believing in Santa on Miracle on th Street to simply surviving it, as embodied in more left field films like Gremlins or Home Alone.“It suits so many styles too, from family friendly to action to comedy to horror, even in the superhero genre with Batman Returns.”Askedany modern films make the shortlist, he says that it is generally the classics, but his partner would loveone year he just did entirely Hallmark and Netflix original films - “not sure I could bring myself to do that mind,” he laughed.However, he’s a firm believer that Christmas films cross all genres and are not always family friendly. “There are definitely some I wouldn#t let my nephews or nieces watch over Christmas, such as Bad Santa, Rare Exports and - as of  minutes ago - tonight#s film Stanley Kubrick#s Eyes Wide Shut.“Definitely some recent ones I#d throw in for future years, like the Happiest Season, which I thought was a lot of fun.”On the day itself there is usually no time for movies, he said, but on Christmas Eve at about .pm or so, he cuts up some big slices of roast ham cooked earlier in the day with some wheaten bread, pours a beer and sticks on The Snowman to see him into Christmas Day.“Not sure why but it#s always felt like a moment of calm before the big day,” Andrew concluded.You can find Andrew at twitter AGRMooreMost ReadNorth Down landowner anger as Stormont department set to list World War Two artillery gun house in his gardenNI taxi driver handed suspended sentence after sharing sex act video in WhatsApp groupUlster Rugby must clary its position on Kingspan sponsorship, says Baroness HoeyNorthern Ireland Spend Local card deadline extended for second timeMichael O’Neill explains ‘respectful’ anthem compromise that his Northern Ireland teams reachedTop VideosPlayWatch: Passengers given sick bags as flight attempts to land at Dublin Airport during Storm BarraPlayVideo: Armed Police swoop through balcony after  hour stand-off in BelfastPlayTake a look inside the former Tesco store in Belfast’s city centre which will be an event space over ChristmasLatest Northern IrelandActor Adrian Dunbar lines up for event tackling mental health issuesExecutive urges public to take lateral flow tests twice a week coming up to Christmas to combat spread of Omicron iantShared island already exists, Patrick Kielty saysParents at two primary schools vote in support of integrated statusOmicron in NI: Five things you should know about latest Covid iantLatestFionola MeredithOpinionWelcome to Planet Fear, where nobody is safe... or sensibleCovid-busting party probe branded a ‘sham’ as new claims emergeOlivia Wilde: I’m happier than I have ever beenActor Adrian Dunbar lines up for event tackling mental health issuesLeicester crash out of Europa League after defeat in Napoli,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The reports, published on Tuesday, assess cross-border trade in services and “enhancing the attractiveness of the island of Ireland” to high-value foreign direct investment . The first of the set of economic reports examines the extent of cross-border trade in services on the island of Ireland and the characteristics of the firms participating in this trade. The main services traded include transportation and storage, business services and computer consultancy. Sales to Ireland account for % of services outflows from Northern Ireland and for % of services inflows to Northern Ireland, the report states. For trade from Ireland, Northern Ireland accounts for slightly less than % of total services exports from Ireland. This reflects the relatively small size of the Northern Ireland economy and the highly export-orientated and FDI-dominated structure of Ireland’s services sector. In terms of the balance of trade, the report found that more services are exported from Northern Ireland to Ireland relative to those from Ireland to Northern Ireland. Examining the characteristics of services firms active in cross-border trade, the report finds that exporting firms in services are systemically larger and more productive than non-exporters. The author of the report, professor Martina Lawless, said: “The patterns identied in this report suggest that there is considerable scope for expansion of cross-border trade in services. “The monitoring of the effectiveness of trade support policies would be greatly improved by expanding and coordinating the information collected on cross-border services flows.” This second research report provides novel evidence on factors and policies underlying the attractiveness of Ireland and Northern Ireland to FDI in high-value knowledge-intensive sectors.      This research also explores opportunities for policy coordination and cooperation on the island of Ireland that could enhance the attractiveness of both jurisdictions to high-value FDI. The research finds that FDI in high-value sectors in Ireland and Northern Ireland accounts for substantial shares of all new greenfield FDI projects. At over %, these shares are higher than the corresponding averages for Great Britain and the EU countries. Speaking ahead of the launch of the reports, Tanaiste Leo Varadkar, said: “We commissioned this research to provide a high-quality evidence base for looking, in real terms, at how we could do more, and do better together, across both parts of this island. “How we could align better, levelling up and taking the best of both jurisdictions. “The research shows that there is much more scope to ‘think all-island’ when it comes to the services economy and attracting foreign direct investment, accruing economic and societal benefits both North and South.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   McDaid\" title\"Sadness at the passing of CharlieMcDaid\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"The lateCharlesMcDaid.HomeSadness at the passing of CharlieMcDaid overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   McDaid\" title\"Sadness at the passing of CharlieMcDaid\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"The lateCharlesMcDaid.HomeSadness at the passing of CharlieMcDaid overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

Owner of Ferry Clever, Christopher Ferry, said he believed it was more important than ever to shop local this Christmas. “Everything was in lockdown and a lot of small local businesses really got affected by that. I think this is probably the most important year ever regarding supporting local because a lot of businesses really struggled to get back on their feet after being closed for so long. “I think that people realise that, and they are really going all out this year to support local. A small business like myself doesn’t take it for granted, I really appreciate it and I would just really push to support local this year especially. Big operators like Amazon can be handy but your small spend makes a giant dference.” Ben Allen, owner of local record store ‘Abbazappa,’ spoke of the benefits of choosing to shop local. “I know my customers. I know them by name, they know me. The thing about a record shop is when a customer is with you evenit’s only for a few minutes, you’re that person’s best friend and you can talk about music, recommend things, and talk about all sorts. That doesn’t happen online. Online is completely soulless.  Ben Allen, proprietor of Abbazappa.  “The greatest thing on earth is being able to look through the products in the likes of a record shop or book shop physically. It’s a pleasure to do that. You can pick it up and seethe products okay before buying it. You can’t do that online, it’s a bit of a lucky dip.” Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA, Paacutedraig Delargy, also urged the people of Derry to support local businesses this year. “On the back of the voucher scheme, we’re encouraging everybody to spend their pound in local businesses as it’s been such a tough couple of months for them. Anything that can be done to make sure these businesses get back on their feet, we need to do it and make sure we can support our local high street shops.” The new Ferry Clever store can be found at - Bishops Street, and Abbazappa Records can be found at the Yellow Yard on Palace Street.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   McDaid\" title\"Sadness at the passing of CharlieMcDaid\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"The lateCharlesMcDaid.HomeSadness at the passing of CharlieMcDaid overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

John Hume was widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the recent political history of Ireland and one of the architects of the Northern Ireland peace process. The prizes to his name include the Nobel Peace Prize , the Martin Luther King Jnr Non-Violent Awardand the International Gandhi Peace Prize . His we Pat led the announcement and following her recent passing it is the continued wish of the Hume family and Foundation that they be loaned to and displayed in the city. Chair of the Business and Culture Committee, Councillor Conor Heaney, welcomed the key stage in the process of having the items displayed in the city. I am pleased that we have been able to approve the funding for the display of the John Hume Peace Awards in the Guildhall so that the public can view these internationally signicant items, he said. John is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the recent political history of Ireland and was one of the architects of the Northern Ireland Peace Process. He is the only person in the world to have received all three of these awards and their prominent display will give just recognition to that achievement and add to our offering to visitors to our City and District. The paper was presented by Head of Culture at Council,AeidinMcCarter, who added: The Hume Family wish for as many people to see the collection on display as possible and it has been agreed that the Guildhall will be the most appropriate and fitting venue to display them in. Theyare expected to go on display later next year. Speaking at the Committee meeting yesterday, SDLP councillor Rory Farrell said: This is a fantastic gt from the Humefamily to the people of this city. John and Pat are sadly no longer with us,but their legacy lives. Their legacy ispeace, it’s peaceful change. It’s the power of dialogue over violence and John in particular was widelyrecognised and revered for hiscontribution to peace on this island. Hes the only person in historyto be awarded the three big peace prizes and the Humes family have loaned thosethree prestigious awards to the peopleof this city. So, I think its right andI think its proper that those are awardsare publicly displayed in the Guildhallso locals and visitors alike canappreciate and understandthe magnitude of John and Pat’sachievements.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   McDaid\" title\"Sadness at the passing of CharlieMcDaid\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"The lateCharlesMcDaid.HomeSadness at the passing of CharlieMcDaid overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

It also states the need for increasing the notication period for utility companies to implement price rises and introducing a cap on energy company profits. On publishing the report, Ms McLaughlin said:“Households across the North are struggling right now. Between the cut to Universal Credit, increasing national insurance contributions, the runaway cost of oil, gas and electricity, people are finding it really dficult to make ends meet. To date, our First Ministers have shown no political will or, it has to be said, interest in tackling it. “The SDLP is publishing this action plan, setting out our view on how hard-pressed households can be supported in the short and long term. This includes direct support by extending the Winter Fuel Payment to Universal Credit recipients who have already had their payments cut by the Tory Government and facilitated by Sinn Feacutein Ministers. We are also proposing a Warm Home Discount Scheme that would reduce energy costs by facilitating the installation of insulation while decarbonising our housing stock. “We are also seeking to reform the structural issues that have led to successive price rises at short notice to households. That should include extending the period that companies must give notice to consumers before a price rise takes effect. This will allow families time to prepare for signicant increases rather than being caught on the hop at times like Christmas when energy use is traditionally higher. “I don’t believe that the First Ministers understand the scale of this crisis.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   McDaid\" title\"Sadness at the passing of CharlieMcDaid\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"The lateCharlesMcDaid.HomeSadness at the passing of CharlieMcDaid overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

She took to Facebook in a search for information about the school after noticing it as she travelled up and down the road. “I had been passing this school every day and was just fascinated by it. I wondered what it was called, when it was up and running, when it closed,” she told the County Derry Post. “Wee country schools like that had generations of families in them, and it was just something I became fixated on. “I wanted to know what it was called, andanyone had any memories or photographs of it. It was really to get a lot of people talking about it. “I wanted to stir up a bit of nostalgia among the community that was linked to the school, and was hoping that it would bring a lot of people back in touch with each other. “One lady hilariously came back and said there were some she could do without getting in touch with, and that made me laugh.”  Councillors raise County Derry road issues with DfI officials  Department officials were speaking at a recent full council meeting.   Despite that particular womans reluctance, Julie was able to gather a huge amount of information on the old school, which had been in use for almost  years. Opened in , the school had undergone two extensions in its -year stint, and at the time of its closure, Mr Noel Cunningham, who had links to the RAF, was the principal. A Mrs Carson taught at the school around the same time, while there were two dinner ladies named Bertha Clarke and Greta McKinney. Julie said she had been contacted by  past pupils of the school during her search for its history. “I ordinarily wouldnt have been out this road, but now being on it every day, I see it, so I thought Id put it out and seewe got anything back,” she said. “People were putting up messages, tagging people and asking Is this the school you were at  and I wondered how long it has been since those people were in touch with each other. “I thought it was a really lovely site a quaint country school, and there arent many of them around. I know its up for sale so I thought Id like to know the history before anything happens to it.” The derelict site at Killure PS. Despite the relatively recent closure of the school, photographs have proved dficult to come by for Julie, with just one unearthed so far. She is appealing for anyone with information or photographs to get in touch with her via the Derry Post to pass on what they know. “If anybody had photographs it would be a lovely thing for me to be able to share with everybody,” she said. “It was just to see what I could get back about it for them. I dont know these people I dont know any of them, but theyve all been so lovely in coming back to me. “Surely to goodness, after all thatof time, the papers would have covered a school like that closing ” If you have any information or photographs relating to Killure School, Drumcoon Road, Aghadowey, get in touch with us via editor@derrypostor give us a call on .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec Email: editor@derrypost  addthis, A County Derry group within the Ulster Farmers Unionhave welcomed the further roll out of a local broadband provider into Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Fibrus is currently developing full-fibre infrastructure in rural parts of Northern Ireland, and as part of the process, has struck up a partnership with the UFU. The company became affinity partners of the UFU, meaning their members are able to avail of special rates for its broadband services. James Graham, Group Manager of the South Derry Londonderry UFU said full-fibre broadband would have a major impact on how farmers in the area live and work. “Having access to effective and efficient connectivity services is now essential to those working in our industry,” he said. “This new network will help boost our mission at UFU to support a vibrant and sustainable farming economy. “Modern farming practices and administrative processes have become increasingly digitalised, so connectivity has quickly become a crucial utility on our farms. “We have secured an excellent deal with Fibrus which is available to all our members, so we hope many of them take up this beneficial opportunity - as I have already.”  INTERVIEW: Cllr McPeake: Broadband is a priority  The Mid Ulster councillor says Project Stratum needs to be carefully managed.  Liam Tunney speaks to local Sinn Feacutein councillor Sean McPeake about council pragmatism, his role models and helping St Brigids Mayogall go viral last year.   The live network was launched last week in Magherafelt, and Fibrus Brand and Marketing Manager Joe Diver said rural regions had been living in the digital darkness. “That’s why we are committed to connecting communities and equipping families and rural businesses - whether SMEs or farming businesses - with the tools to thrive in modern times,” he said. “We are already making our way across Northern Ireland, transforming connectivity in these areas and addressing the digital imbalance that exists between urban and rural. “Working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union has helped us to identy ways to support local farms and agri-businesses specically, which we know make up a major portion of rural economies. “We’re delighted to now be live in Mid Ulster and look forward to seeing those who need it most, reap the benefits of our hyperfast broadband services.” For more information on the work of Fibrus and the Ulster Farmers’ Union partnership, visit www.fibrus ufu.

A fitting tribute for a great snooker man.”  Derry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,   Obituaries    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   McDaid\" title\"Sadness at the passing of CharlieMcDaid\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"The lateCharlesMcDaid.HomeSadness at the passing of CharlieMcDaid overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

Deaf Awareness and sign language shouldbe taughtto everyonein schools,” she said. In a recent episode, Rose and her partner Giovanni danced a section of their performance without any music and Pauline found that moment very important for the Deaf community. “When Rosie danced with no music to show hearing people what Rosie was feeling, it was fantastic,” said Ms. Doherty. Rose has been an inspiration to young people all over the UK and the Dungiven based charity have been unequivocal in their praise for young dancer. “Rose is fantastic, I love watching her and I really hopes she wins,” said Wendy Cassidy, cleaner at Hands That Talk.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   McDaid\" title\"Sadness at the passing of CharlieMcDaid\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"The lateCharlesMcDaid.HomeSadness at the passing of CharlieMcDaid overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   McDaid\" title\"Sadness at the passing of CharlieMcDaid\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"The lateCharlesMcDaid.HomeSadness at the passing of CharlieMcDaid overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

I, like many other families, cycle with my we and three small children and this space and environment to enjoy that time together safely and without fear of accident or injury is a blessing, said Cllr Lewis.ldquoNewry Mourne and Down Council proudly supports active and healthy communities and this cycle lane connects the local council to Stormont in a collective effort to improve the health and wellbeing of residents through the promotion of cycling and the enjoyment of outdoor leisure.Cllr Lewis also congratulated his Slieve Croob colleague, Cllr Andrew McMurray, who has been proactive in ensuring the district is marked on the map in terms of provision of safe cycle routes.He also revealed that Cllr McMurray has challenged him to a timed lap of the new route when it opens and hopes the event will raise money for a local charity, while the duo have a bit of fun along the way.Cllr Lewis said he has asked the Department for Infrastructure to consider the needs of those who need access to agricultural land that runs adjacent to the new pathway and cycling route, during construction and when it is completed.ldquoLand along this particular route is utilised for barley, potatoes and grazing, with the ground rotated each season which means that the fields are regularly in use throughout the year, he explained.ldquoPolice regularly pull in farmers driving along this stretch of road requesting that they facilitate traffic flow by waiting in a lay-by, allowing the build-up of traffic behind them to pass.Cllr Lewis said he has asked the government department consider how itrsquos going to accommodate agricultural or slow-moving traffic, suggesting that the original lay-by structure in the area needs to be maintained and protected to allow for safe access.He added: ldquoThese issues certainly arenrsquot impediments nor am I seeking to cause an obstruction.

I am contacted about cleansing issues on a daily basis and while working with council staff a solution is found, butrobust processes and procedures were in place, this should be routinely completed and no major issues should arise.Cllr Sharvin says he is also keen to see greater attention on cleaning play parks, explaining that currently there is no formal process to do so and operates on adhoc basis.ldquoGiven the increase of use play parks during Covid and the councilrsquos objective to increase healthy living in our communities, itrsquos vitality important that we clean and maintain our play parks on a regular basis. Council officials have agreed to replace surface safety tiles at our play parks and I hope this programme will continue to be rolled out, he said.Cllr Sharvin said that following the recent workshop, council officers are to compile a report which will be discussed by councillors..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"District’s battering from Storm Barra  ","story":"DOWN District was pummelled by Storm Barra yesterday with gale force winds and driving rain coinciding with a spring high tide to wreak havoc.Thunder and lightning was added into the heady weather mix with the storm conditions bringing down a number of trees along the coastline.

He and his we, Charlotte, live near Edinburgh and have three sons, Angus, Jack and Hector.His introduction to rowing came only six years ago when he took up skf racing. He competed at the  world championships in Strangford Lough where he won a silver medal and went on to win two gold medals at the  world championships in Stranraer.Clive admits to being highly competitive and that after winning world titles he was looking to take another step forward.A TV documentary about explorer Ben Fogle and Olympic rower James Cracknell rowing across the Atlantic fired his imagination and he signed up for the Talisker Atlantic Challenge in January  along with his medal-winning team-mates, Ian Baird, Duncan Hughes and Ross McKinney, plus a friend, Fraser Potter.They formed a team, Five in a Row, and then set about putting their project together, which involved the not inconsiderable matter of raising pound, to cover their costs.They managed to get the money and then obtained a boat, which, they were delighted to learn, had been rowed by three Scottish brothers in a previous Atlantic Challenge race.Clive says: ldquoIt was tough going, but we managed to raise the money.

The Planning Service has formally approved the plan which will see the Rowallane Inn transformed into a new -bedroom complex.Confirmation that approval has finally been given comes over a year after plans to develop a new hotel in Saintfield were made public and initially rejected by local planners.Politicians were also split over the plan, but amended drawings for the multi-million pound scheme have now been approved and Down councillors will be asked for their views on the scheme during their monthly meeting next Monday night.The plans also include the provision of a newroom, dining area and a lounge bar and the businessman behind the hotel project is delighted the scheme has finally been given the green light.Mr Frank Kearney said he hoped there will be no further obstacles placed int he way of a scheme he says has major benefits both for Saintfield and Down District.ldquoI believe Saintfield is an ideal town for a major hotel and the location of the Rowallane Inn at one of the busiest road junctions in Northern Ireland lends itself to such a development, he added.DOWNPATRICK ndash Shots were fired during the attempted robbery of a Securicor van in Downpatrick on Monday morning. Police officers lying in wait at the Safeway complex on the Ballydugan Road fired several shots when a cash delivery man was threatened with a replica firearm.Two men were arrested at the scene and appeared at a special court yesterday morning on a series of charges.The drama began at .am as the van arrived to deliver money to the Safeway store.

pop royalty and real-le royalty, George Lowdenrsquos guitars are known to be the best in the world.The Prince of Wales recently made known his knowledge of and fascination with Georgersquos guitars and Ed Sheeran reportedly likes to keep one handy in nearly every room of his house.With Niall Horan of One Direction and Dubliner singer songwriter Dermot Kennedy becoming the latest owners of the bespoke guitars, Georgersquos company, Lowden Guitars, has just announced its latest collaboration with Sheeran.To celebrate the release of his most recent album, Sheeran has teamed up with George, who founded the firm in , to design and create a signature guitar worthy of music royalty.The Sheeran by Lowden Equals Edition guitar will also be available to the public to purchase, with a limited edition run of , available through Lowdenrsquos global dealer network.Itrsquos the second joint project with Sheeran, following on from their range of more affordable guitars.The latest achievement comes in the wake of George recently meeting the Prince of Wales at a Windsor Castle reception to mark Lowden Guitars winning the  Queenrsquos Awards for Enterprise.He also launched a new range of limited edition guitars to mark his th birthday over the summer which features specications chosen by George.Itrsquos all a far cry from when the renowned luthier first began to hand-make guitars for his own use.He could never have known that his determination to make the best guitar would see his name travel around the world and be spoken of by royalty.ldquoTherersquos quite a lot of things that have happened that I never could have imagined. When I started out, I had no formal training in the manufacture of guitars, explained George.ldquoIn a way, that gave me the confidence to take some risks, innovate and produce an instrument that has a completely unique voicing.He found the Prince of Wales to be very interested in the guitarsrsquo manufacture and may have even suggested a new development.ldquoWe had a great chat and he asked quite a lot of questions about the wood, all kinds and how we found it, said George.ldquoHe was also very interested in dieback ash, asking aboutit would be a very good way to use the trees as a lot have perished due to this disease.ldquoIt wouldnrsquot be the best toned wood you could find but Irsquove been thinking more about that since and wondering whether we could use it for guitar necks or not so we might do a little experiment to seeit works.From creating coveted instruments for top Irish and UK guitarists in the know, Lowden Guitars have become an international sales success mdash hence the Queenrsquos Award.George explained: ldquoThe company is far bigger than I ever envisaged. In some ways itrsquos good but I never tried to expand the company and get the kind of growth we have enjoyed. It just kind of happened over the years as organic growth which has been great.His guitars tend to sell by word of mouth from musician to musician and the actual experience of playing a Lowden and relishing its distinct tones at first hand.ldquoWherever in the world where we sell, we are still quite a niche, upper end company so the guitars are at the highest price level in all of the countries, said George.ldquoItrsquos a natural process where people see the guitars for the first time. They go into a shop and then over a period of a few years the reputation builds within that country. Our presence also grows and then we move into more specialist guitar shops, so it all takes time.ldquoI remember as a teenager I was mad keen to get a Gibson  which I saw in Matchettrsquos shop window in Belfast all those years ago and I couldnrsquot afford it.ldquoIf something is really good, and the young player comes in and plays it but canrsquot afford it, it goes into his or her mind and later on they find a way to afford it.George says the Covid pandemic has not impact on sales, although it has had other consequences.George said: ldquoIt didnrsquot impact on us for sales as our order book remained very firm but it was more to do with making the guitars as we had to completely re-organise the factory for better social distancing which was very expensive.ldquoWe had to close down the factory for a while in order to do that and more with people having to isolate it proved challenging..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Magpies fly high in Breffni Park  ","story":"DOWN kingpins Kilcoo qualied for an Ulster semi-final after a good performance at Kingspan Breffni Park on Saturday evening, defeating Cavan-based Ramor United by  points.The Magpies, reigning Ulster champions, will meet Glen of Derry in the last four in what will be a massive clash in two weeks time.It was tit-for-tat early on but the home side got a massive confidence boost in the fth minute via a well taken Sean McEvoy goal, their most impressive performer on the night.Kilcoorsquos response was emphatic though, firstly Ceilum Doherty stuck over a nice point and then that man Jerome Johnston done what he does best and fired to the net to put his side into a lead they would never relinquish.Further scores from Ryan McEvoy, Shealan Johnston and Doherty again sent them in four up at the water-break.The second period of the first half turned out to be poor affair with both sides missing good scoring chances.

McCollam fired over another point in the th minute and pointed a free at the very end while trying to it in on the Downpatrick area to poach a late goal.McCloskey didnrsquot score in the second half and being out of general play resulted in his normally reliable free-taking also taking a hit.At the other end the outnumbered Downpatrick forwards had to survive on scraps as well but they could always rely on their free-takers.Goalkeeper Pearse Smyth landed two points from inside his own half, while Tom McGrattan converted three frees and landed a point from play as well.McGrattan was the star of the game and he capped a brilliant inidual performance with two late plays that effectively took his team into the final.With the game in the balance at - each in the rd minute, McGrattan jinked his way along the sideline under the stand to win himself a free.It was an acute angle, but the Portaferry clubman arrowed the sliotar between the uprights.Then less than a minute later he played a beautul cross-field pass into the path of mid-fielder Finn Turpin, who stepped inside the defender and hit the roof of the net from  metres out.St Patrickrsquos were through to their first ever Danske Bank Mageean Cup final where they will play St Patrickrsquos Maghera at the Dub Arena on Friday week, December .But back again to that breath-taking first half.After five minutes, the teams had each scored three points. By the tenth minute, Jack McCloskey had cut through the Red High cover and shot to the net off the base of the right hand post.Within three minutes Downpatrick were a point up. McGrattan went around the left side of the Ballymena defence at full pace to rle to the roof of the net for one of the best goals that you will see at any level.Aodhan McGarry responded by pointing from a side-line and the water-break broke the action at - each.McGarry started the second quarter scoring with a fine point but a run of three successive scores from Finn Turpin, McGrattan and Oisin Coulter edged the Red High ahead again.However, three frees from Jack McCloskey and a point from Ronan McCollam put Ballymena in the lead by - to - at half-time.By the second water break Downpatrick were - to - ahead, mainly through frees and St Louisrsquo were now looking for scores from distance.The next  minutes went scoreless. In hindsight Ballymena snatched at a couple of scoring chances that might have put pressure on the eventual winners who pumped a lot of ball in high on the north Antrim defence with no .Eventually sub Tom McFerran brought the teams level and McCollam from the left wing gave St Louisrsquo the lead. The gauntlet had been thrown down for the Red High.Oisin Coulter landed a much-needed Downpatrick point in reply and they held firm until Tom McGrattan delivered the match-winning scores.It is scant consolation for Ballymena that they played their part in a fine display of schoolsrsquo hurling, but a number of players stood out including Daire McMullan, Connor Dickson and Dara Martin in defence and McCollam and McCloskey in attack until tempered by Downpatrickrsquos packed back line.Defence was ultimately the winning of the game, but they would not have got across the line without Turpin, Oisin Coulter and especially the mercurial Tom McGrattan.As a hurling disciple of the great Bro Charles in the s, I was a proud man leaving the Dub on Friday evening.For the generations of hurlers who climbed to the top of the hill on Saul Street each morning over the past  or  years, winning a Mageean was just not on the radar.This team is only  minutes from achieving what for us was the impossible.St Patrickrsquos: P Smyth - frees, J Ruddy, R OrsquoNeill, D Coulter, S Mageean, D Mallon, C Lenaghan, T Connolly -, F Turpin -, M Dorrian -, A Connolly, T McGrattan - , O Coulter -, R McGrath, S McCarthy.Subs: F MacManus for A Connolly , LMcCabe for S McCarthy , F Casey for R McGrath ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Road officials set to carry out survey at Ballynahinch school  ","story":"PLANS by roads officials to carry out a survey on the main road outside Ballynahinch Primary School have been welcomed by Strangford MLA Peter Weir.The work will be carried out to assess the potential for a new pedestrian crossing and while pleased that the survey is to take place, Mr Weir is disappointed that there are no current plans to also introduce a temporary mph speed limit at the Dromore Road as part of a province-wide Department for Infrastructure initiative.Mr Weir mdash who has met with school principal Mr Michael Moore mdash said the safety of children who have to cross the busy road was of paramount importance and a real issue of concern for parents and residents.The former Education Minister said he was ldquodisappointed that the school had not been included in the Roads Departmentrsquos part-time mph speed limit scheme.ldquoI believe that the Department needs to give a clear commitment that Ballynahinch Primary School will be included in the next roll-out of the scheme, said Mr Weir.ldquoThe Dromore Road is busy and is also a bus route.

Good work by all three.Cross-countryThe Robinson brothers, Oliver and Alex, ended off their  cross-country season with a trip to the Uneven Age Group All Irelands Cross Country in Gowran, Kilkenny, on Sunday.The sun shone all day but the temperature stayed low with the ground remaining icy in parts. Alex had gained his Ulster U- team place by coming sixth at the Ulster  NI race in Donegal a few weeks previously, so he had set his expectations high.His race was ,m around a very twisty course through long grass, all of which made it more technical than previous races.The start of any cross-country race is hectic with lots of jostling and this was no exception.Alex was pulled back when the gun went off and then had to contend with some fallers so he never really got into his stride.He was disappointed to place th out of a field of  runners, but deserves huge credit for his commitment over the last few months.Alexrsquos older brother, Oliver, was running for the Down team in the U- race. He was probably one of the youngest in the -strong field, having celebrated his th birthday a few days beforehand, so had no expectations and therefore maybe put less pressure on himself.He had a great run in the end, taking one minute and  seconds off his previous road k personal best and completing the course in .. He finished th and was the second Down team member home.Both boys have done their club proud and their parents also deserve medals for acting as support crew on multiple weekends. They will all be glad of a rest before racing resumes in January.Dillon in KGavin Hynds, as a long term member of East Down AC, was delighted when his son, Dillon, decided to follow in his footsteps by signing up to the EDAC junior section.Dillon has been attending sessions since September and gaining confidence each week, so when his school, Our Lady and St Patrick Primary, announced a fundraiser k fun run and walk he felt that he might be fit to take part as a runner.On Saturday morning despite the horrible weather conditions, he set off to the RGU in Downpatrick with Gavin as his sidekick. K is a long way at Dillonrsquos age, but to give him his due he stuck at it and made it to the finish with a bit of encouragement from his dad.

In my opinion, such an appointment is crucial and could benefit the town and the business community a great deal.ldquoThe night time economy is one area that needs to be improved not only in Downpatrick but where, but rapid progress this in the current Covid climate may not be possible.ldquoHowever, there is no reason why ideas to regenerate our night time economy cannot be discussed now to lay plans for the future, he continued.Cllr Curran said every high street is dferent, with many people keen to see them become vibrant shopping hubs at the heart of local communities, explaining that the work of the Stormont task force could not be more timely.He added: ldquoAnything that can be done to increase footfall in our town centres in the future will be more than welcome.The call for evidence document is available at https:www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk consultations call-evidence-high-street-task-force, while responses to the call for evidence can be made to highstreet@communities-ni.gov.uk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11360838.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: ldquoI took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.ldquoIt is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.ldquoThis decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.ldquoThis decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.ldquoThese housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.ldquoSince my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast ndash that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.ldquoKeeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.ldquoAdhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.ldquoMy officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their future is terrying.”During his career, James competed in several athletic categories and won two gold medals for Great Britain at the  New York Paralympics. He denied he had caused a public nuisance. Extinction Rebellion’s occupation of London City Airport was designed to highlight the climate impact of air travel.The most energy-intensive activity an inidual can undertake, no other human activity consumes as much energy in such a short time.Mile for mile, flying is the most climate-damaging way to travel.Extinction Rebellion has a number of cases going through the Crown Courts.James’s was the fourth jury trial, and followed the acquittal in April  of six people for criminal damage to Shell’s London HQ, despite all but one having no defence in law.In July this year, the UK government published its Jet Zero strategy to achieve net zero in the aviation industry by .Air travel is an elite activity.Only a tiny percentage of the global population can afford to fly and they have a disproportionate carbon footprint.Taking a long-haul flight generates more carbon emissions than the average person in dozens of countries around the world produces in a whole year.The government has repeatedly been advised by its own Climate Change Committee to limit the growth of aviation in the next  years, starting with a halt to airport expansion.The government’s suggestion, in its Transport Decarbonisation Strategy, that the public can continue to fly since aviation will be carbon neutral by mid-century have been widely ridiculed.The government has recently proposed a reduction in Air Passenger Duty Tax whilst the industry is already estimated to be subsidised by £bn per year.The news comes as the PCSC Bill, which has been widely criticised for seeking to limit the right to protests, s to the House of Lords for amendments.Zoe Blackler, Extinction Rebellion media officerFor more letters, opinion pieces, and News Letter editorials, go to this link:gt www.newsletter news opinion lt——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

But they weredisciplined by the chief constable, prior to full understanding of the circumstances, after nationalist uproar at PSNI handling of the Covid breach. The saga fuelled the sense that when republicans get upset about something, the PSNI high command jump.The police ombudsman investigated the complaint against the two officers and sent a file to prosecutors. It is now December, almost a year after the incident. Are prosecutors unable to expedite cases that patently lack merit This incident is not the only example of policing weakness in the face of certain outcries. Feebly, Simon Bryne last December buckled in face of ombudsman criticism of the handling of Black Lives Matter protests that June. Far from apologising, as he did over that episode, the PSNI should have stood firm in how it responded to the calculated breach of social distancing in the second Black Lives Matter gatherings. Is Mr Byrne unaware that people who obey Covid rules need to see that those who deliberately don’t will face consequence It was heartening yesterday to see a string of distinguished policing figures — Mark Lindsay, Jim Gamble, Roy McComb — call for the two officers to be ed to normal duties.We give thanks to such PSNI officers for their service in a delicate community atmosphere, eventheir leaders do not. ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Everyone will want to meet with close family and friends and it’s important that people make informed decisions about that, and thatthey are meeting that they do so safely.“We all know the things that we can be doing to make those meetings safer. That is about getting vaccinated and getting our boosters once it’s our turn, and it is about wearing face coverings when we’re meeting indoors, and that it’s well ventillated.“Nobody invites me to parties any more so I shall be spending my time with my close family.”Northern Ireland’s Chief Scientic Advisor, Professor Ian Young, added: “I think it’s really important that we adhere to the guidelines that are in place. If meeting family and friends and socialising is important, as it is to many people, then I think it’s appropriate that we should do that.“If you do see me at any parties over the Christmas period, you’ll notice me staying near the window as much as possible and I can guarantee you I will have taken a lateral flow test beforehand.”Prof McBride, meanwhile, said it is important the rules apply equally to everyone following the furore surrounding reports of multiple reports of Christmas parties at Downing Street while the UK was still under lockdown.Sir Michael said: “I don’t know what went on or didn’t go on, but what I can say is there is no rule for one and dferent rules for everyone . These rules are there for all of us and it is in everyone’s best interests.“This is about controlling the pandemic, a pandemic that has taken a signicant toll in terms of lives lost and livelihoods impacted upon.”He added: “It’s particularly important that everyone abides by the rules and follows the regulations. “I think it’s important that the public see that we practice what we preach.”Paul GivanMichelle ONeillNorthern IrelandStormont Executive  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularDonaldson repeats threat to bring down StormontSinn Fein rising star quit over paymentsFuneral details released for tragic dad Aaron Harkin | ‘you had the biggest, kindest, caring heart’ | ‘a le taken too soon’Dennis Hutchings family lodges formal complaints over lost ‘key evidence’The ‘gradualism’ of the Northern Ireland Protocol fits the Irish republican strategyMost PopularMost romantic Christmas gts for partners: food and drink gts, and personalised presents for her and him best men’s waterproof hiking trousers UK: stay dry hiking with trousers from Craghoppers, Berghaus, MontaneMS have announced their Christmas dinner range for  - here’s what’s available, on sale nowThe best gingerbread house kits to buy for Christmas - from houses to bake from scratch to ready-made Aldi releases two festive gin liqueurs for Christmas, including a Spiced Biscuit flavour - how to buy                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The document that was locked away in Downing Street bore the signatures of four members of the British delegation who had negotiated it. They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe complaint to the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales against the Cardf and Vale University Health Board was lodged by the patient -referred to in the complaint as lsquoMr Drsquo -who was unhappy with the care and treatment he received at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardf during and after a scheduled admission for surgery to remove the right side of his colon.Mr D, who has Aspergerrsquos Syndrome, complained that hiscondition - at the time believed to be Crohns Disease -was not clearly diagnosed and that clinicians were slow to identy he suffered a post-operative bleed and needed further emergency surgery.He complained that information about his treatment and care was not provided clearly to him despite those caring for him knowing about his Aspergerrsquos Syndrome. He was also unhappy with aspects of his care after his discharge.Mr Drsquos surgery was carried out on the presumption that he had Crohnrsquos Disease according to the Ombudsman, but surgical findings suggested complex chronic appendicitis.The Ombudsman found that neither of these conditions needed the extensive surgery that Mr D was given. The Ombudsman also found there was no complete record of how his condition was monitored following his surgery and that his post-operative bleed might have been detected sooner.The Ombudsman also concluded that the clinicians were aware of the patientrsquos Aspergerrsquos Syndrome but did not clearly communicate the information about his diagnosis and treatment to him. The Ombudsman also found that the patient was not seen by a mental health clinician as requested by Mr D because it was not arranged.MORE NEWS:The Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint regarding Mr Drsquos care post-discharge.Nick Bennett of Public Services Ombudsman for Wales said: ldquoThis regrettable case highlights yet again the importance of one of the key principles of prudent healthcare formulated by the Welsh Government ndash lsquodo only what is needed and do no harm.rsquoldquoPhysicians responsible for Mr Drsquos care should have employed a lsquowatch and waitrsquo approach in which his condition would probably have settled without surgical treatment.ldquoInstead, Mr D, a vulnerable inidual, faced completely avoidable trauma of unnecessary surgery and post-treatment complications ndash a trauma which saw him seek mental health support. I anticipate that my findings will be extremely distressing for him. This is reflected in my recommendations in this case.The Ombudsman recommended that Cardf and Vale University Health Board provides Mr D with a detailed apology and a redress payment of pound,. Mr Bennett also recommended that the physicians and nurses involved in Mr Drsquos care have relevant training in the management of Crohnrsquos Disease and chronic appendicitis as well as the care and management of patients with Aspergerrsquos Syndrome.It was also recommended that the nursing team consider the importance of conducting and documenting post-operative observations and of preparing accurate and relevant care plans.The Ombudsmans report says Cardf and Vale University Health Board has accepted the findings and conclusions of the Ombudsmanrsquos report and has agreed to implement the recommendations.A spokesperson for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: \"As a health board we would like to reiterate our sincere apologies to Mr D for the concerns identied in the report.\"We are implementing the recommendations from the Ombudsman and an improvement plan has been developed to monitor the delivery of all recommendations within the agreed timescales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityExactly how fast the city should grow is up for debate as Cardf council launches a major consultation on its local development plan.Another issue is how many of these new homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.The development plan is a hugely important council document shaping how the city will evolve until , and the consultation runs for  weeks until February .The first phase of the consultation looks at how many new homes and jobs the city might need over the next  years, with three specic options. Currently developers already have plans for an extra , homesmdashwhich havenrsquot yet been builtmdashthanks to the existing local development plan.Although, itrsquos possible that not all of these will actually be built. Some additional lsquowindfall sitesrsquo are also likely to come forward, where developers build homes not allocated in the development plan.So factoring these in, the first option would mean an extra , homes needed, as well as , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , by .The second option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This could mean more affordable housing.The third option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This is based on population growth projections from the previous development plan, which some critics say were too high.Councillor Caro Wild, cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: ldquoThe replacement LDP is going to shape the look and feel of Cardf for years to come, so it was really important for us to hear as wide a range of views as possible. At this stage of the process, we are accessing a number of dferent scenarios on the possible levels of growth in Cardf up to , and the need for houses to be built to accommodate this growth..removeldquoIt is important that people understand the consequences of the options, as most growth scenarios will have pros and cons with regard to important issues such as land for employment opportunities, the impact on the environment, addressing housing need, supporting the delivery of community and transport infrastructure, and how many truly affordable homes that could be provided.People can respond to the consultation by visiting the website https:cardfldp.consultation.ai, while there will also be focus groups to gather views of people who donrsquot normally respond to council consultations.The next phase of the consultation explores eight options on how the city should accommodate a growing population, and how many homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.Option one would extend the existing strategic sites, built on countryside on the outskirts of the city. This would mean more affordable homes and a wider range of housing, due to the cheaper construction costs of building on greenfield sites.Options two and three would see new homes built mostly on urban brownfield sites, meaning land which has already been developed. This would mean denser housing, and could be more expensive to build with less range in size. Option four is similar, but focusing on building around existing district centres to create a lsquocity of villagesrsquo concept.Option five would see new homes built around existing transport links in urban areas while option six would focus growth around proposed transport improvements like the metro and planned new train stations, including on some greenfield sites.Option seven would focus on greenfield sites not already earmarked for development, on countryside on the outskirts of Cardf. Option eight would be a mix of using greenfield and brownfield sites, in urban areas and the countryside, to get the best of both.Cllr Wild added: ldquoAt this stage of the process, all of the options that are presented in the consultation are potential options, rather than preferred options. The preferred strategy could combine a number of these options together. All of the feedback from the public will be considered, alongside further technical work, which will help the council prepare the preferred strategy that will be consulted on with the public in autumn .This consultation follows a previous one held earlier this year, which focused on what the broader goals of the replacement development plan should look like. This included exploring how the city should face problems like coronavirus and the climate crisis. The final plan is expected to be approved in October . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityPollsters Yougov surveyed a sample of people from Wales and the rest of Britain, asking them whether they would support or oppose banning people who have not been vaccinated against coronavirus from visiting public places.Such places would include events and non-essential shops, Yougov suggested.The poll comes as some countries attempt to ramp up vaccination rates by either threatening new restrictions or making jabs mandatory.Political leaders in the UK have downplayed the prospects of such restrictions being introduced, but other European nations have already begun taking steps to curb freedoms for unvaccinated citizens.The Yougov poll found that in the Wales and Midlands area, nearly two-thirds of peoplesaid they would either strongly support, or tend to support, banning unvaccinated people from non-essential public places.Just one in four peoplesaid they would oppose such restrictions on the unvaccinated.The regional results largely match the total response from Wales, England and Scotland, which showed  per cent would support a ban and  per cent would oppose it.MORE ON CORONAVIRUS:Yougov uses sampling data to measure public attitudes to current events and issues. In this case, some , people across Britain, including  in the Wales and Midlands region, responded to the survey. While the sample cannot give a  per cent accurate record of public opinion, it does provide a helpful indicator of which way the wind is blowing when it comes to any future Covid policies on vaccinations and restrictions.A few days ago, Germany announced it would be reimposing some restrictions across the nation, as well as bringing in tough new measures aimed specically at unvaccinated people..removeMany leisure and entertainment venues will only be accessible for people who have either been vaccinated or who have recently recovered from Covid, and the German parliament will also consider a general vaccine mandate which,passed, could come into force as soon as February next year.The nation follows neighbouring Austria, which last month brought in lockdown-style rules for people who have not been vaccinated. Around  per cent of people in Austria have been fully vaccinated ndash one of the lowest rates in western Europe.By comparison, some  per cent of people in the UK have been given both jabs, and booster vaccines have already been administered to . per cent of those people who are currently eligible.Asked on Fridayvaccines could ever be made mandatory for the general public in the UK, a spokesman for Downing Street told reporters: \"Wersquove set out our policy on this and wersquove said itrsquos not something that we would look to introduce.\"And earlier this week, Wales health minister Eluned Morgan said such rules were\"not something the Welsh Government has considered\".While health is devolved in Wales, policies regarding vaccines have remained largely the same across the four UK nations, led by common advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation .However, England has taken the additional step of making vaccines mandatory for health and social care workersndash a measure which hasnt been introduced here in Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

But rather than rising to the challenge this Budget is just more managed decline under the SNP.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton also argued the pay increase for care staff wouldnot deliver ldquothe transformational change we need.With Ms Forbes also having pledged public sector wage rises of pound for those earning less than pound, a year, pound for those on pound, to pound, and pound for those earning more than this, the Lib Dem added this would be a real terms pay cut for ldquoteachers, nurses and many thousands of public sector workers..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Kate Forbes seeks to tackle child poverty and climate change in - Budget article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCoco Rose Bradford died on July   after being admitted to the Royal Cornwall Hospital, known as Treliske Hospital, with severe vomiting and diarrhoea on July .She was initially discharged only to be readmitted overnight on July  when her symptoms worsened.Coco was eventually transferred to the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, where she later died.Blood tests showed Coco had ldquooverwhelming sepsis by the time she was transferred.An inquest sitting in Truro is considering whether a dferent course of treatment may have saved her le.A review published in September  found Treliske staff ldquomissed opportunities in Cocorsquos care, including by failing to recognise Coco was in shock and administering an inadequate fluid management plan. vw,vw,px, px\"Coco Rose Bradford developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome It further found there had been a delay to starting antibiotics overnight on July  when Cocorsquos test results showed she had developed sepsis.Dr Yincent Tse, a consultant paediatric nephrologist at Great North Childrenrsquos Hospital in Newcastle Upon Tyne, said on Thursday he did not believe Coco could have been saved.The inquest previously heard Coco had developed haemolytic uraemic syndromendash a rare condition triggered by E.coli that causes the destruction of red blood cells.Giving evidence to the inquest, Dr Tse explained that HUS is caused by the toxins given off by the bacteria that get into the blood stream and causes the platelets to clot in the small blood vessels.It mainly impacts the kidneys but can also affect other organs, including the brain ndash particularly in children ndash causing them to become confused and, in some cases, cause seizures.HUS can also cause tissue death in the brain, resulting in serious brain damage..removeThere is no proven treatment for the condition, Dr Tse said, but there is evidence it is ldquoself-limiting, meaning it can run its course on its own.Antibiotics are not recommended, the inquest heard, because they can cause the E.coli bacteria to release its toxins, worsening the disease.Left to itself, there is the possibility the E.coli might pass out naturally.The inquest also heard doctors decided to give Coco half the level of fluids recommended by the National Institute of Care Excellencebecause of concerns about kidney damage. vw,vw,px, px\"There was a delay moving Coco from a general paediatric ward to the intensive care unit Dr Tse said: ldquoI think it is a reasonable course of action because while you can give halfyou canrsquot take away half, andthere is kidney shutdown there is a worry that the lungs will start filling up with fluidyou give too much.He said it was reasonable for doctors to have given Coco half the levels of fluid and then reassess her, adding: ldquoI think thatrsquos quite good practice.Dr Tse was askedit would have changed the outcomeCoco had been admitted on July  and given ldquooptimal fluids instead of being sent home.He replied: ldquoUnfortunately, because there is no treatment for the HUS toxin or the disease itself, I donrsquot think that would have made a dference.There was also a delay moving Coco from a general paediatric ward to the intensive care unit.Dr Tse again did not believe this would have saved her le.ldquoAlthough her perfusionwasnrsquot very good, she eventually, after a few hours of delay, got the treatment that she needed, he said.ldquoBut despite that, over the next few days inwith maximum support, she continued to deteriorate.He continued: ldquoI think, sadly, this was going to happen.Dr Tse was asked whether he believed medics should have given antibiotics at the point it was clear Coco had sepsis.He replied: ldquoI would share the hesitation in giving antibiotics, however I think thatat the timethink giving antibiotics might be helpful because of developing sepsis, I think that any nephrologist would go along with that.Another failing identied by the independent review into Cocorsquos death was that her blood pressure was not taken until  hours after she was admitted to hospital.The inquest heard that Coco, who was autistic and had limited speech, had become very distressed at having the cuff placed on her and nurses had been unable to take a reading.It has emerged the hospitalrsquos specialist learning disability and autism service were never called upon to help.The inquest will hear the final evidence on Friday, with Coroner Andrew Cox due to deliver his conclusions on a date yet to be set..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Medics could not have saved child with sepsis, expert says article_url

a vintage horse-drawn caravan - is to come under the hammer at Wilsons Auctions.By Valerie MartinThursday, th December , : pm  \"       \"  The rare horse-drawn caravan which is for sale through Wilsons Auctions.The caravan, which was built in the mid to late s, is one of only a handful remaining in the world so this is an extremely unique opportunity for someone to acquire a piece of history at auction.Also known as a Romany Gypsy ledger caravan   do, the asset is property of the estate of the late Mr Jack McNeill and comes from a letime of appreciation.It is thought that the wagon was brought from Wales to Ireland by a Mr Lovell and his we during the First World War. Soon after they arrived in Belfast it is believed that Mr Lovell died from Black Flu and before he died, and about to be left alone, Mrs Lovell accepted compensation for the damage that the wagon had suffered in the sea crossing and gave up ownership.The vintage horse-drawn caravan has been lovingly restored.It was the custom at that time in some Romany communities that the do was burned when the owner died, hence making this type of caravan particularly rare. This wagon luckily escaped as it had passed out of Mr Lovell’s hands.In  it came into the ownership of Mr McNeill. He completely stripped down, repaired, and repainted the original wood and metal employing the skills of craftsmen such as signwriter   restorer Mark Stead and wheelwright Cecil Watson. Where replacement was necessary, he sourced only authentic materials. Whilst in the restoration process, a museum stated that they estimated therewere only five remaining in the United Kingdom. It is estimated that this number has decreased still further since then.The wagon was transported to Bray, Co Wicklow in  where it had a starring role in the feature film of Charles Dickens’ ‘The Old Curiosity Shop’.Wilsons’ Plant, Machinery and Commercial Manager Richard McFetridge said: “I am delighted Wilsons Auctions have been entrusted to auction off such a special, historical asset. This horse drawn caravan has been meticulously cared for over the years and is a testament to its owners. I have no doubt this extremely rare wagon will be highly sought after and look forward to the outcome of the auction.”Bidding on the wagon will open on Wednesday, December  at pm. Bidders will have a full  hours to take part in the auction and place their bids, as the bidding will time out at pm on Friday, December .

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process. The DUP was looking for two-thirds.”Michelle Weir, Local Democracy Reporter--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.

But one of our key priorities will always be to look after our most vulnerable citizens to ensure that they do not miss out, are protected from this virus, and are not left behind. “I would like to personally offer my thanks to all of the owners of these facilities and their staff for helping us to deliver this programme, and of course to our highly skilled and extremely dedicated vaccination teams, without whom programmes like these simply would not be possible.” For the latest information on the Western Trust’s vaccination programme please visit the Western Trust Vaccination Info page.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_faacddbdbbf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cecefbecafcdc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1638984916407.jpg--covid_19___wed_8th_december_figures.jpg?163898491600","title":"covid  wed th december figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows five further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.
