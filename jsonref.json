Hattie was regularly weighed while staff were getting her to lose weight They believe he may need a lot of treatment including dental work and check-ups for diabetes and cataracts which is a common problem for larger dogs. But for now he is living next door to Hattie, who staff say is giving him some advice on how to slim down. Ms Rickard added: \u0027Hattie has been giving Bopper some weight loss tips.\u0027They both live in the bungalow on site with me - they have rooms opposite each other.\u0027So Bopper must listen to Hattie\u0027s tips - she\u0027s so much better now - she\u0027ll help him through it.\u0027            Bopper (pictured right) lives in a room next door to Hattie (left) on-site at Gables Farm Dogs and Cats Home in PlymouthToo fat to fit in a kennel - Big Bopper the Whopper - JustGiving"},{"url":null,"title":"Driver records taking selfies wheel moving bus not seems","story":"The mischievous driver shared footage of himself behind the wheel of a moving bus.

We think that a local school is covering the subject.” Broadhursts sold the book for 99p.The book, added Ball, was “originally stocked by Marie, our full-time children’s bookseller at the time”. Marie, now 84, still works at Broadhursts part-time.“We always had faith it would sell, as we do with all our books. We choose every book we stock inidually, rather than having random batches of stock sent to us,” said Ball. “Often books unsold within nine to 12 months are returned to the publisher, but some we keep for longer, either because they (or the subject) are personal favourites of ours, or because there are not many other titles on the subject available. We know that one day, someone will want that exact title, however long the wait.”Other British booksellers shared similar stories. Tamsin Rosewell of Kenilworth Books said that her shop had kept a copy of The Larger Moths of Warwickshire in stock for 10 years. “I was quite sad when someone bought it,” she said. Huddersfield children’s bookshop Lindley Books said that “we do a little dance when we sell a book like that”. And elsewhere, a staff member at San Francisco culinary bookshop Onmivore Books said that “whenever that happens here, I tell my customer that their book has been waiting for them a very long time”.Not all books find such happy endings: one bookseller recounted a less positive experience involving a copy of Piers Morgan’s autobiography that wouldn’t shift. “I worked there two different times in four years, and we never sold it, even when it was reduced to 1p! It’s probably still there,” wrote Twitter user @captainrobs. “It became shorthand for an impossible task ‘You’re more likely to sell that Piers Morgan book than…’”Joanne Ball said the overwhelming response to her tweet was a sign of the affection that people still have for bookshops, and books. “It isn’t often you see book-related stories going viral, which has been a great surprise – lots of book-lovers out there wanting to support it, too. We have had some great reactions from our local and regular customers, but the fact that people in the US and Australia now know about us, and have been talking about us, is just unbelievable,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a1f473e0fb6869cb4d4f2d96d2d94bf3992e82d/0_169_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03aef1738878f651b44d867ecc5a6bf2","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of themWelcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:First up: ancient history. Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War continues to delight paulburns:First read it at age 17. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve reread it after that. Its one of my favourite books. Just to mention a few magnificent highlights of great historical writing - The sea battle between the Corcyreans and Corinthians, 433 the plague in Athens, 430 the fighting at Megara, 424 the character sketch of the Spartan commander, Brasidias the rise and fall of Cleon the destruction of the Athenian Expedition in Sicily, 413 the oligarchic Coup and its overthrow in Athens.I can’t do a post on Thucydides and not mention his use of speeches. He gives recollections of speeches he has heard himself or pieces together a speech from accounts of those who were there at the time. Apart from the Melian dialogue, where he more or less expounds on his philosophy of history, he begins a tradition in classical historiography which is eventually much abused by speeches just being made up by some later writers. If you haven’t yet read Thucydides, put aside some time to do so. Its a reading experience you won’t forget.Another “non-fiction delight”, Babel (Around the World In 20 Languages) by Gaston Dorren, has occupied storm46:What an enjoyable read for a Languages nerd! The story of 20 Lingua Francas, sometimes their particular linguistic quirks (to other language speakers - not to the native speakers concerned of course), their social conventions, their rise to power and the reasons why they may have become a lingua franca, and just oodles of fascinating facts. The chapters, depending on the language under discussion, cover linguistics, history, politics, and the writing style is effortlessly readable and very funny.I particularly appreciated this quote from the sardonic chapter on Français, written in 1671: “Of all languages, French has the most natural and sleekest pronunciation. The Chinese and well-nigh all Asian peoples sing the Germans grumble the Spaniards holler the Italians sigh the English whistle. Only the French can properly be said to speak.”BerlinBirdie wants to “rave” about The Buddha in the Attic by Julie Otsuka:About Japanese brides travelling to the US in the 1920s to marry Japanese emigrants there, who’d mostly lied about their financial and social status, and sent photos of younger, better-looking men to tempt their brides. Rather like a dating app in fact. The book details the women’s experiences in a precise, moving way, not by following inidual stories but by depicting their varied but collective experiences - written in a first-person plural voice (“We were... Some of us found...”) and taking their lives stage by stage - the voyage, the arrival, the first night, babies, children, etc etc. A lot of their experience was hard as you might expect, yet the tone is never accusing or miserable. It’s clear, calm, delicate - almost poetic in fact. Brilliant.Completely brilliant, every last story. Every last word. There were stories from all across the spectrum, pre-war Colorado, antebellum slavery, Mexico in the days of Pancho Villa, hardscrabble Texas... They all seemed to rotate a common center of gravity, the struggle against unrealized potential for pre-Suffragge women. It still seems relevant in an age when women’s health choices are often dictated to them by the ovary-free.Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris has been the “right book at the right time” for LiteraryWanderings:This was my first foray into the world of David Sedaris and it won’t be my last. I found that the essays became stronger after the first third, but how much this was the writing or me becoming attuned to Sedaris I’m not sure. Laugh out loud funny in parts, this has been a perfect reading companion of late.Finally, EstelleMoon took a “nosee into nostalgia” and read Night Watch by Terry Pratchett:I really liked it! It’s one of the City Watch series within Discworld which focusses on Sam Vimes and the police force of Ankh-Morpork. It made me laugh out loud more than once, and is at the same time a pretty pointed and successful satire on revolutionary idealism.It’s a great book. We need Vimes now more than ever…If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

City economists had forecast a deficit of about £1.5bn. Official figures show that car exports to non-EU countries jumped by £1bn, while imports fell by £1.7bn, in the three months to September. Despite the weakness of the pound, which should help to boost demand for British goods, there are mounting worries for the future of UK trade as the world economy slows and Trump imposes trade barriers on China and the EU.After the IFS thinktank accused Philip Hammond of taking a “gamble” on the future strength of the public finances in last month’s autumn budget, the latest figures showed a bigger than expected budget deficit in October. Public-sector net borrowing, excluding the nationalised banks, grew more than City economists’ forecast by £1.6n to £8.8bn compared with October a year ago, marking the worst October for the public finances for three years. Analysts said the latest figures suggest the chancellor may now miss his tax and spending targets set by the Office for Budget Responsibility for the current financial year, while warning that a no-deal Brexit could further damage the public finances.The UK’s housing market fell to the weakest level since September 2012 last month, with prices flat or falling across half of Britain according to the latest snapshot from the country’s official surveyors’ body. The latest snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said its headline house price balance fell to -10, from -2 in the month before, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll. House prices were flat or falling in six of the 11 regions covered by the survey, up from three in June. Economists said that the reading was likely to reflect buyers’ caution before the Brexit vote and a reluctance among sellers to put their properties on the market. To add to the pressure, the prospect of higher interest rates from the Bank of England is also likely to make it more expensive for prospective home owners to buy a property.Figures released this month revealed that business investment has declined for three consecutive quarters, marking the worst run for the level of corporate spending in the economy since the global financial crisis a decade ago. Analysts laid the blame squarely on Brexit uncertainty, which has deterred companies from spending on new machinery, technology or building works. The CBI lobby group warned that investment is “flooding out” of Britain to other EU countries, although UK business investment in recent years has always lagged behind major economic rivals. Britain has, however, fallen further behind since the Brexit vote, according to Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting monetary policy committee. While a Brexit deal could help boost business confidence to invest, he said: “I suspect quite a lot of that is a permanent loss.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1be08fb65a0be68d0f1106929688a983ca844f4e/0_115_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77451ce0b65b5eaba2682284e13ad5c6","title":"britain deserves better brexit may peoples vote","story":"There is little to laugh about in the epic ongoing shambles that is Brexit, but there were at least a couple of moments of mild levity during my visit to Westminster this week. As I navigated the House of Commons between meetings I happened to find myself briefly at the door of a committee room and face to face with a gathering of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group, as they were assembling for the latest chapter of their stuttering bid to depose the prime minister.I am not sure which of us was more surprised to see the other, and I declined to offer them any advice. As if that wasn’t enough, I almost literally bumped into Boris Johnson while on my way to meet the prime minister. I asked the former foreign secretary if he wanted me to pass on any message to Theresa May. He suggested telling the PM to “get it sorted”.It was perhaps an unconscious admission from Mr Johnson that the whole Brexit fiasco, which he helped set in train, is largely un-sortable, at least on the current trajectory. However, the fact that the Tory hardliners have, thus far, failed to mount any actual challenge to a prime minister whose authority is more weakened than that of any other occupant of No 10 in modern times betrays the weakness of the case for the hard Brexit they advocate, or for the disastrous no-deal outcome some of them crave.The truth is, as is now becoming steadily apparent, that there is almost certainly no Commons majority for May’s proposed deal – and there is most definitely no parliamentary backing for no-deal.With Amber Rudd, the newest member of Mrs May’s cabinet, now making clear that she expects parliament to exercise its authority to explicitly reject and prevent a no-deal outcome, it badly undermines the PM’s strategy, which has been to present things as a stark choice between her deal and the cliff edge of no-deal.That is an utterly false choice, and it is now, day by day, being exposed as such. We should not be presented with the option of frying pan or fire. What is needed is a workable, better alternative to the prime minister’s deal. And it is incumbent on all of us who oppose it to come up with something that can command majority support. And while there is not yet a finalised alternative to the prime minister’s plan, there is now an emerging cross-party consensus that can lead to a much better outcome, with broad agreement between the SNP, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Greens – and, indeed, some Conservatives – that parliament must reject both the current proposal and a no-deal outcome.Continued, permanent membership of both the single market and customs union is one such alternative proposal that could well command majority support in the Commons. That outcome is one that the Scottish government has been consistently proposing for two years now. And it is one that is likely to find favour in Brussels. EU leaders may say that they are not open to renegotiation – they can say little else ahead of Sunday’s special summit, assuming it happens – but remaining in the single market and customs union does not involve the same renegotiation from the status quo as the UK government’s approach has done.My first preference, of course, along with that of my government and party, is for us to remain in the European Union, which is what the people of Scotland voted for overwhelmingly. That could still be achieved by a so-called people’s vote, which I have made clear the SNP would support if it came to be voted on in parliament – and any referendum would have to have a remain option for it to offer a meaningful choice. That may yet be the alternative that proves capable of commanding a majority in parliament, and the SNP would be part of it. And if it takes a general election to break the impasse and ensure a less damaging outcome to the one that we currently face, then that is something the SNP would be very ready to fight. We would go into any such campaign, unlike most other parties, as having had a completely coherent and consistent position on Brexit.From a Scottish perspective, one thing above all else is clear amid the Brexit chaos – that is, the cost to Scotland of not being independent. Independent Ireland has had nothing but support from its EU counterparts Scotland has been treated with nothing but contempt by the UK government. The Tory party, or at least those of them who even care, may not yet appreciate the long-term cost to the union of such behaviour, but it will become apparent when the people of Scotland come to vote again on their future.• Nicola Sturgeon is the leader of the Scottish National party"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7780d521e0d64d61c01674bff24702ee90705402/0_0_2548_1529/master/2548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=576a4534a35074ed2cc7086146f55797","title":"the guardian view on the populist moment difficult times","story":"Across Europe, moderate politicians are anxious about the vitality of their democracies, the sturdiness of their institutions, the civility and harmony of their societies. The threat they see is a deepening political polarisation, documented in a series in the , which began this week. Once the choice offered to an electorate was simply between the centre-right and centre-left. Now they are being offered choices on the right and left too. This represents a shift, especially for western democracies, which got used to centrist politics. In the last few decades the axis of politics has shifted rightwards, so that the centre is now situated where once the right had been. Hence the arrival of “populism” as a political force grounded in the notion of the centre versus these opposite extremes.This is a global phenomenon. When Jair Bolsonaro is inaugurated as Brazil’s president in January, five of the world’s seven largest democracies will have populists at the helm. They include India, the Philippines, Mexico and the US, which elected – in Donald Trump – a president some believe to be the first populist president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who died in 1945. Populism, clearly, is not new, and the current spike should not be overstated. In much of the western world, the established political order remains more or less intact. But clearly a dramatic realignment is under way. In the coming months the  will be exploring what the political theorist Chantal Mouffe has labelled “the populist moment”. In Europe, populism is often conflated with nativism and far-right politics, but is rarely used to describe parties or leaders on the left. The reverse is true in Latin America, where populism has historically been associated with the politics of the left.The UK’s first-past-the-post electoral system acts as a defence against populist insurgencies, but it did nothing to prevent the country’s vote to leave the EU – a decision encouraged, in part, by intensely populist rhetoric about out-of-touch technocratic elites in Brussels. Many of our continental neighbours see Brexit as a dangerous political experiment, and part of a sinister ideological continuum stretching from Nigel Farage to Trump to Vladimir Putin. Europe watches in alarm as Steve Bannon, a Trump ally, attempts to mobilise a hard right network in next year’s European parliamentary elections. His campaign is faltering but there is no doubting the threat Mr Bannon poses.There is a fundamental challenge in how to confront nativist populism without further alienating the voters who are attracted by its proponents. Trumpeting the economic benefits of migration, for example, does little to shift opinion among people who do not believe those benefits accrue to them. Fact-checking doesn’t reach those who reject the authority of the fact-checkers. There is an idiom of anti-populist rebuttal that comes across as a sneer, treating voters as dupes, unhelpfully bundling deep-rooted cultural disorientation with far-right aggression. But to tiptoe around real racism, indulging xenophobia as an expression of “legitimate” grievance, is also no remedy. Where mainstream parties have adopted anti-immigrant rhetoric, they have simply emboldened extremists – giving permission to ever more overt racism.The roots of populism are deep and primarily economic, despite the objectionable way they often find expression. Telling voters the problem they raise has no easy solution sounds like an excuse for inaction. Or it leads to technocratic tinkering. That was a feature of the centre-ground politics that now looks directionless. There is a demand for big answers and radical political ambition. The appeal to pragmatism too often sounds like code for defeatism or denial of the scale of public discontent. The appetite for drastic upheaval must be met with optimism and imagination. Credible responses to social and economic distress do not have to be modest. Appeals to a collective national interest and rhetoric of collective solidarity can be made without scapegoats. A platform needs compelling political expression to have a chance of being delivered. No one says being radical and realistic is easy, but too much is at stake to surrender and say it is too hard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd6fc812a5433b52cd949ff3a390587d75e23cd5/0_0_941_573/master/941.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ead1827524feec8855be9afd6cdd839 940w","title":"noel edmonds jungle debut to coincide with lloyds legal action","story":"TV star to appear on I’m a Celebrity as he begins legal action against bank over high-profile fraudLloyds Banking Group will be keeping tabs on ITV’s I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here as Noel Edmonds brings his battle against the lender to the jungle camp.The TV presenter’s appearance on the reality show is expected to coincide with his lawyer delivering a letter that will kickstart Edmonds’ much-trailed lawsuit against Lloyds.

In particular, it found that lower pay for minority ethnic women was much more likely to be due to ethnicity than gender.“While the sector’s formidable work to improve women’s careers should be noted, more attention is required for interventions to further improve the ethnic ersity of recruitment,” said Viola Salvestrini, the report’s author."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b820746ba1716895ef0ff379ff004d8c0b9c529c/0_4_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ae6ec1594b7136172393cb73d4cc3d0","title":"uk hydrogen heating 2050 emissions targets gas boilers electric climate change","story":"Swapping gas boilers for mix of electric and hydrogen may also be cheapest way, says reportMillions of gas boilers will need to be replaced with hydrogen alternatives and coupled with electric heating devices if Britain is to hit its carbon targets at the lowest cost, according to the government’s climate advisers.In a report on the role hydrogen could play in the energy system, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) spelt out the huge but necessary cost the country faces to switch to green heating.While electricity supplies are rapidly switching to low-carbon sources, almost all homes today rely on fossil fuels – predominantly natural gas – for heating and cooking.The public is largely unaware of the alternatives, said the report, and consumer understanding is “far from where it would need to be” before decisions on decarbonising heating are made in the 2020s.While householders can keep their radiators, the CCC envisages that in future they will need to live in much more energy efficient homes with heat pumps that use electricity to draw heat from the ground or air, running alongside gas boilers.Air-source heat pumps cost about £6,000-£7,000 but are expected to become cheaper as they become more mainstream.Chris Stark, the chief executive of the CCC, said the committee had previously been a “bit suspicious” of heat pumps but was now confident enough to recommend their rollout as a hybrid heating measure running alongside gas boilers, before a later move to hydrogen too.Stark urged the government to set out its plan for decarbonising heat in the next three years.The report said while ministers may have “a strong temptation politically to ‘kick the can down the road’ by sticking with natural gas for longer”, it would be cheaper and better to act sooner.Despite the high costs of decarbonising heating, the CCC believes the total consumers spend on energy bills could stay similar to today, as it expects electricity prices to fall as more is sourced from wind, solar and nuclear, and costs of running a car to become cheaper owing to the switch to electric vehicles.Stark said he was now more optimistic about hydrogen, and that it offered “something in the long-term that we need”. But the CCC said producing hydrogen in a low-carbon way would be a big challenge.Today the vast majority is made from natural gas and is high carbon, but in the future that production would need to involve carbon capture and storage. Producing the hydrogen in bulk using renewable electricity generation and electrolysis was considered “unnecessarily expensive”, said the CCC.It added that evidence showed the use of hydrogen would be increasingly important to cut carbon emissions from industrial processes, such as in furnaces and kilns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41e56f7f1cd1ff461615bceaa671d1523534d18b/302_109_1618_971/master/1618.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7179714eaebadac3dad52e268af023","title":"ten everyday ways drivers make cyclists feel unsafe","story":"From speeding and light jumping to parking in bike lanes and passing too close, driver behaviour is one of the main deterrents to widespread cyclingWhat prevents significantly more people in the UK from riding bikes for everyday transport? The primary answer is simple: a lack of safe infrastructure.If cyclists are expected to share the roads with a tonne or so of speeding metal then, global experience shows, you won’t get more than a certain, small percentage of the population doing it, predominantly the young and gung ho.But the reasons behind this are more nuanced than they might seem. Yes, actual danger is a significant issue. But in the UK, cycling is both less safe than it could be and also significantly more safe than most people believe, with an average of a million miles ridden per serious injury or death.The problem is it feels unsafe. A pioneering 2015 study found frightening incidents, even if they did not actually cause harm, were a routine experience for UK riders. This is a particular issue for novice cyclists, many of whom are swiftly put off their new mode of transport.Although safe cycling infrastructure can prevent the great majority of such experiences, it’s also worth stressing that near-misses are not necessarily intrinsic to the current road system. Many happen because of poor choices, carelessness and reckless actions by other road users, overwhelmingly drivers and to a lesser extent riders of motorbikes and mopeds.I decided to try and create some sort taxonomy of these behaviours by borrowing a cycle camera, riding my usual route to and from work in London, and recording what happened. The highlights, if you can call them that, can be seen in the video above.The vast majority of the clips come from the last few weeks, though a couple were from earlier. Some of the dates shown in the bottom of the screen are incorrect as it took me a while before I remembered to set it properly.The borrowed camera was a Fly12, an excellent combined front camera and light made by Australian company Cycliq. I also briefly used their rear-view model, called the Fly6, which you see in a couple of the clips.Before I list the behaviours, one final point is worth noting: this video is almost certainly an understatement of the extent of frightening behaviour on most UK roads.One of the most scary, and regular, experiences is excess driver speed. All my clips come from central London, where congestion keeps average speeds low. Ride in a less built-up area and you will routinely be overtaken by cars doing 40mph or much more, even in 30mph limits. This is no fun.Also, almost all the riding took place on my carefully-plotted route into work, which mainly comprises side roads. It’s no surprise that several of the worst incidents I chronicled come from a single spot – the perennially feral roundabout on the south side of Lambeth Bridge.After all that, here is my list of 10 driver behaviours that routinely intimidate and frighten cyclists. Watch the video for my examples, and then tell us which ones annoy or worry you the most.No fun in a car, terrifying if you’re on a bike. It’s amazing how often some drivers think it’s OK to drive an inch behind your rear wheel. The example in the video was a particularly bad one – the driver concerned seemed to think I should have been in the bus lane, even though it was occupied further down, and tried to more or less shove me off the road.A hugely common experience, generally carried out by drivers who feel compelled to overtake no matter what the risks. Obviously, fast close passes are the most scary, but they are always a shock, as shown by the startled yelp I generally give in the examples above.Another routine occurrence, often requiring you to slam on the brakes. The example above features a motorbike rider, who tailgated me down a narrow 20mph street where it was clearly unsafe to overtake, beeping the horn, before pulling across me to turn, seemingly as much for punishment as convenience. Don’t turn up the volume too loud at work, as I’m afraid I swore.This is ubiquitous, and as mentioned above, is much more of a problem on quieter roads. Even in London at less congested times, for example during the night, speeding is the norm. The example above shows that even when it’s a moped, an over-fast overtake can be startling.It is amazing how many drivers think cycle lanes are some form of emergency parking. The video snippet above features a sight I see several times a week – a 24-hour bike lane near where I live blocked by someone who has decided to pop into the adjoining shop, forcing riders to pull out into the centre of a busy road while going up a hill.This seems linked to some drivers’ belief that cyclists should be squeezed into the gutter, and that if they’re not it’s fine to edge into the rider’s lane to try and nudge them over. In the example above, I was deliberately in the centre of the lane on the roundabout in question, as I was turning right immediately afterwards.Every cyclist knows this one: as the road narrows, usually for a pedestrian traffic island, someone in a vehicle tries to overtake at the last minute, obliging the cyclist to brake heavily to avoid being forced into the kerb, or worse.Used in many cities, these painted boxes at the front of traffic lights are designed to allow cyclists to set off from a green light in full view of others, not trapped among a stream of vehicles. Sadly, quite a few drivers ignore this, forcing cyclists either to wait behind or edge even further ahead.There is much popular fuss about this habit among some cyclists. But watch most junctions carefully and you’ll see just as many drivers ignoring the red. This is often done at speed – many accelerate across as the lights change – and causes many more deaths and injuries. As ever, it’s all about the physics.It’s common as a cyclist to have vehicles occupying space which isn’t strictly theirs. The example in the video shows one of the many ways the residential street shown is unpleasant to ride on – right-turning drivers cutting the corner, veering heavily into the opposite lane. If you’re coming the other way in a car this can be unsettling. Do so on a bike and it’s downright scary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46a973d65042a1b76effc9d522fd4efc7deb9230/0_1002_7318_4391/master/7318.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78754a801cebda7cacf4c68ceaab1a35","title":"call of the blue marine life around the world in pictures","story":"Teeming with images of spectacular underwater scenes from around the world, Call of the Blue is the culmination of a five-year project by the photographer and ocean conservationist Philip Hamilton.

There have even been years without a major studio release bearing any holiday themes or connections. The absence of the Christmas movie is often credited to the constraints of release windows and limited marketing opportunities: these titles only have relevancy in NovemberDecember and waiting a year between theatrical and home video is no longer an option.But Netflix is ready to fill the void by releasing a series of original films operating somewhere between the Hallmark channel and the multiplex in terms of production values. This year brings The Holiday Calendar, The Princess Switch, A Christmas Prince: The Royal Wedding and, positioned as their tree topper, The Christmas Chronicles. It’s being given a sizable marketing push with the star power of Kurt Russell and the production clout of Chris Columbus (“from the film-makers that brought you Home Alone …”) but sadly, no number of mobile push notifications could turn this into a movie worth watching.It opens with a polished year-by-year montage of home movies chronicling Christmas morning excitement that is so Hollywoodised it’s unlikely to draw comparisons to any viewers’ real experiences. It’s also so oppressively cheery that you just know it will culminate in the absence of a family member by the time we reach present day. Sure enough, dear old Dad (Oliver Hudson) died tragically on the job, heroically saving families from a burning house. This leaves Mom (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) juggling her demanding job at the local hospital with single parenting her teenage son Teddy (Judah Lewis) and 10-year-old daughter Kate (Darby Camp).Kate clings to Dad’s favorite camcorder (a hilariously outdated model even when the diaries begin in 2006) and is introduced recording a video message to Santa. Meanwhile, Teddy is quickly devolving into juvenile delinquency from underage drinking to stealing cars – an action that is portrayed with shockingly little repercussion in a film aimed at families. After a painfully long prologue, we arrive at Christmas Eve and Mom has been called in at the last minute to cover an overnight shift. Teddy and Kate let their sibling dysfunction ease slightly and work together to set up a hidden camera in hopes of catching a glimpse of Santa. Seriously, there is so much camcorder action you’d think this was a Paranormal Activity spin-off. Something abnormal does happen – although not of the ghostly persuasion – as Santa does in fact arrive.Santa is played by Russell who instantly brings a level of energy and professionalism sorely lacking from the film. His comic timing, twinkly eyes and impressively styled beard are almost enough to inspire hope that the movie will turn around. But just as quickly as Santa arrives, we’re treated to the worst green-screen filming in recent memory and all hope is lost. Through a series of madcap occurrences, Santa, Teddy and Kate end up stranded in Chicago, working together to fix Santa’s sleigh, find his magic hat and track down his flying reindeer. If they don’t do it in time, a large percentage of children won’t get their Christmas presents and that would be bad for everyone (“Ever heard of the Dark Ages?” Santa offers as a warning).Hijinks and (attempted) heartwarming ensue and before we know it, we find Santa locked up in the slammer offering his own take on jailhouse rock. While Russell does his killer Elvis impression and Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul cameo as his backup band, you might ask yourself, if this still for kids? The answer is, for a minute or two it’s something more, glimmers of an inspired take on the Christmas movie with enough to appeal to an audience beyond desperate parents and bored elementary school students. But really, the sequence is nothing more than a trifling ersion born out of Russell’s talents (and probably, a big factor in why he did the movie).Between the atrocious green-screen work, the blatant stock footage helicopter shots of city skylines and painfully obvious Toronto-for-America locations, you would be forgiven for thinking this movie was made in 1992. If it weren’t for punchlines about Uber and fake news, Netflix could have sold this as an unearthed relic a la The Other Side of the Wind and we’d believe them.Fortunately, Christmas comes just once a year and Netflix’s Christmas movies will fade from your log-in screen soon enough. That’s not to say Netflix shouldn’t keep trying. The world needs Christmas movies. They can offer a sense of unity or a normalization of family dysfunction. And Christmas trees look great on film. The Christmas Chronicles is no Christmas chestnut, but Netflix has more freedom than a traditional studio to make one. Here’s hoping for yuletide merriment in 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06029855417cb289a3adec64d5c13e5d3122c63a/555_499_5295_3177/master/5295.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4dee48eb84ac5874df3a2e31fd16c29","title":"waste bread gails is making the most of yesterdays bake","story":"While it doesn’t have the most appetising name, the bakery’s sustainable new loaf more than makes up for it in tasteSustainable products don’t have a rich history of charismatic names and “waste bread” – the latest innovation from the bouji bakery Gail’s – is no exception.

While the amount of surplus bread across branches of Gail’s varies by the day, there is usually an unsold proportion, which Bado was determined to put to work.She devised a way to give spent bread a new lease of life, whizzing it up into breadcrumbs before making a stewy “porridge”, which is added to strong white flour, malt and a starter culture. Gail’s says the aim is to make the eventual waste loaf from one-third surplus bread the loaf is correspondingly larger – 750g compared with 500g in the case of the San Francisco. Strictly speaking, it is not replacing any ingredients with the surplus, but it is laudable that the surplus finds a new home on the shop shelf, not in a bin. I also like the fact that the waste bread changes from one day to the next. Gail’s does not limit its surplus element to old sourdough, but puts in whatever is left over from the day before, meaning it is a moveable feast.Given that eco credentials often play merely a tertiary role in our purchase decisions – taste and price are usually the clinchers – my future with waste bread lay in the eating. Reader, I loved it. Gail’s has unwittingly developed the kind of sourdough I wish it had always made, with a crisp, golden crust and moist, almost unctuous innards (it uses the word “tacky” for the crumb, which I think is unfortunate). This softer texture must be down to Bado’s porridge invention, and makes for slices of bread that invite nothing more than salted butter (toasting not necessary). It is 90p more expensive than a loaf of the San Francisco stuff, but, with a third more volume, I am not complaining.

Oh, new day! The Nations League. They laughed when Uefa announced it had commissioned an operatic anthem for its complex new international friendly fudge a piece of music that would “symbolise the unity of a very serious competition”, despite sounding like the incidental music from a terrifying 1970s horror film where a seven-year-old Michel Platini sets his demonic Rottweilers on you.They laughed when Uefa unveiled its shiny new Nations League trophy, there to represent “the pinnacle of a nation”, while also resembling a badly rolled joint made out of kitchen foil. They probably laughed too when Gareth Southgate said the Nations League was a good idea and that England would take it extremely seriously because it was “really important”.Well, no one’s laughing now. Except perhaps at Germany, whose relegation from Group A to Group B was compounded by a humiliating late collapse in the 2-2 draw with a reinvigorated Netherlands on Monday night. In fact, given the sheer rarity of those words, it is perhaps worth typing them again just for the sake of it. Germany, whose relegation was compounded by a humiliating late collapse. And once more. Germany, whose relegation was compounded by ... Well, you get the idea.One thing is certain. With the inaugural group stage complete, the Nations League has already proved itself to be that rare thing, a very good idea very well executed by one of football’s governing bodies.Odd as it might sound given the man who conceived the Nations League is currently banned from football for taking a “disloyal payment”, the beauty of the new competition has been its basic purity, a reminder that the best part of this poor old beleaguered sport is the spectacle of well-matched teams performing at something close to a level playing field.Shoot the whole thing through with some structural tension and a balanced set of groups. And suddenly a form of the game that was supposed to be dying has managed to completely outshine the increasingly tedious and remote Champions League group stage when it comes to dramatic action.This is a part of a broader trend. Look back and the most engrossing elite-level football matches of the last six months have all involved teams who play for a shared flag not a sack of cash. The World Cup was a five-week summer blast. And this week the group stages of Uefa’s newest competition have provided a series of unusually epic set of autumn internationals.Switzerland’s 5-2 defeat of Belgium was shot through with a genuine hunger for victory on both sides. England and Croatia provided a slow-burn treat on Sunday afternoon, a game as tense and densely knotted as their world Cup semi-final four months previously. The Netherlands and Germany in Gelsenkirchen was a joy to the end, not to mention a significant moment in the footballing life of both nations. International football needs the Netherlands. Those who have been watching closely say the Nations League campaign might just have helped reignite that sense of shared orange pride in the national team.There is, of course, a temptation to conclude that the history of these things is written by the winners that England’s success in qualifying for the final stage will naturally create a jaundiced view of the merits of the competition. There has already been some grudging talk of a tinpot trophy, of undue euphoria at crumbs from a competition Jürgen Klopp has called “the most senseless in the world”.Well, here’s another interesting thing about the Nations League. Harry Kane’s late winner at Wembley was worth at least €5m (£4.45m) in bonus payments for reaching the final stage. Which is, it must be said some decent tinpot. Overall England will earn between €9m and €10.5m for competing in this same Mickey Mouse league, a bonus payment equal to around a quarter of the Scottish FA’s complete annual turnover and half that of the Northern Irish FA.Again, those are some sizeable crumbs. Chuck in the £20m England made by reaching the last four of the World Cup and this is now surely the most lucrative year in the competitive history of the England team. Kane, with his golden range of prods and tap-ins and deflections, has more than paid for his own Rooney-style circus game 12 years from now.And so roll on the Nations League, whose only slight oddity from here is a six-month wait for the semis, third-place play-off (yes, really) and final, which will take place over a delicious-looking week in Portugal at the start of June. For England this is all jam, all progress. The brittle gains of the summer have hardened into a progress that feels tangible, given shape by the heat of genuine competitive fixtures.As for Uefa, and indeed everyone else involved in trying to sluice a little extra cash from the world’s great shared sporting obsession, the message should be taken on board. Elsewhere in recent days a report in Süddeutsche Zeitung has suggested the true depth of Gianni Infantino’s mania for selling international football to the highest bidder. Infantino’s “mystery consortium” has been identified as an entirely unsurprising combination of SoftBank Investment Advisers and a London-based company called Centricus Partners, both of whom have ties to Saudi Arabia.This looks to all intents and purpose like a geopolitical power grab, a sell-off that would see Fifa hollowed out, and Infantino himself installed as chairman of a new Fifa outsourcing company. The suggestion is Infantino intends to pursue this project. He may just get it through too given the enduring greed and self-interest at play. Fifa says the document is outdated, and denies any such thing is about to happen.Against this backdrop the current manoeuvres at Uefa look disarmingly sane. There was a fairly convincing suggestion this week that the European club Super League really isn’t going to happen any time soon. Plus of course the Nations League looks like a winner, offering a reminder that football is at its best when money and the hoarding of talent play less rather than more of a guiding role and that when it is allowed to shine the spectacle is still good, the product still vital."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

It’s totally inspiring.”The international development and women and equalities secretary, Penny Mordaunt, said the day was a celebration, but also a reminder “that there was still so much to do”.“The message I would give to women considering a career in politics is despite everything you hear, working here is fantastic, and if you think you might want to do it, the chances are you’d be quite good at it,” she said.Helen Pankhurst of the Centenary Action Group said: “This is a huge year in the history of the women’s movement … I just hope we aren’t waiting another 100 years until we achieve true equality.”The prime minister arranged for two delegates to come from her Maidenhead constituency. One of them, Tameena Hussain, 30, said she was already something of a political animal having been active in her local Conservative party association since her early 20s. Asked if the event had encouraged her to stand for office, she was equivocal. “Never say never,” she said, adding: “But, you know, parliament isn’t as scary as it’s made out to be. If you want to help people, then you shouldn’t let anyone put you off.”"},{"url":null,"title":"first ever plane with no moving parts takes flight","story":"Flight represents breakthrough that could lead eventually to carbon-neutral air travelThe first ever “solid state” plane, with no moving parts in its propulsion system, has successfully flown for a distance of 60 metres, proving that heavier-than-air flight is possible without jets or propellers.The flight represents a breakthrough in “ionic wind” technology, which uses a powerful electric field to generate charged nitrogen ions, which are then expelled from the back of the aircraft, generating thrust.Steven Barrett, an aeronautics professor at MIT and the lead author of the study published in the journal Nature, said the inspiration for the project came straight from the science fiction of his childhood. “I was a big fan of Star Trek, and at that point I thought that the future looked like it should be planes that fly silently, with no moving parts – and maybe have a blue glow. But certainly no propellers or turbines or anything like that. So I started looking into what physics might make flight with no moving parts possible, and came across a concept known as the ionic wind, with was first investigated in the 1920s.“This didn’t make much progress in that time. It was looked at again in the 1950s, and researchers concluded that it couldn’t work for aeroplanes. But I started looking into this and went through a period of about five years, working with a series of graduate students to improve fundamental understanding of how you could reduce ionic winds efficiently, and how that could be optimised.”In the prototype plane, wires at the leading edge of the wing have 600 watts of electrical power pumped through them at 40,000 volts. This is enough to induce “electron cascades”, ultimately charging air molecules near the wire. Those charged molecules then flow along the electrical field towards a second wire at the back of the wing, bumping into neutral air molecules on the way, and imparting energy to them. Those neutral air molecules then stream out of the back of the plane, providing thrust.The end result is a propulsion system that is entirely electrically powered, almost silent, and with a thrust-to-power ratio comparable to that achieved by conventional systems such as jet engines.Prof Guy Gratton, an aerospace engineer and visiting professor at Cranfield University, said: “It’s clearly very early days: but the team at MIT have done something we never previously knew was possible in using accelerated ionised gas to propel an aircraft. Aeronautical engineers around the world are already trying hard to find ways to use electric propulsion, and this technology will offer something else that in the future may allow manned and unmanned aircraft to be more efficient, and non-polluting. In particular, the fact that they have already got this out of the laboratory, and flown a battery driven model aircraft – albeit so far on a very small and controlled scale – is very exciting.”The successful flight of the plane – which has no name beyond the uninspiring “Version Two” – owes as much to the engineering prowess required to make it as thin and light as possible as it does to the propulsion method itself. The plane weighs just 2.45kg, but manages to fit in a five-metre wing, battery stack, and a high-voltage power converter.In the immediate future, the MIT team hope to increase the range and speed of the plane, primarily by scaling up the size of the overall machine. Potential applications in the short term include unmanned drones, where silent flight may be beneficial, and high-altitude solar-powered flight, where the lack of moving parts could allow such a plane to soar for years on end, acting as a pseudo-satellite.In the longer term, the ability to power flight purely through electricity opens up the possibility of carbon-neutral flight, which could lower the emissions of the aviation industry globally.Barrett also noted that solid state propulsion tends to miniaturise well, and suggested that smaller drones than those currently possible with rotor-based flight could take-off using an ionic wind drive in the future. “Solid state things lend themselves to scaling down quite well,” he said, “creating extremely small flight vehicles that serve uses we can’t imagine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/070fb8f0dc3580a3df03c33f64d196f362aed28d/0_0_3500_2527/master/3500.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=88ec05cf849c0149e225a663713fe10b 1400w","title":"the flexible workspaces with community and wellbeing in their fabric","story":"As working habits change, co-working spaces that put people at their heart are finding popularity with small businesses and entrepreneursIf there’s one thing most successful businesses have in common, it’s a strong professional network. From institutional networking organisations to local business community groups, opportunities to build mutually supportive relationships with like-minded professionals are the lifeblood of many a thriving enterprise.Jane Rutter set up Zeal, a digital and creative agency, eight years ago. She attributes “a significant proportion” of its growth to the networks she’s built as a direct result of utilising co-working spaces. The business currently has two offices one based in a Bruntwood building in Leeds and another in a similar collaborative co-working space in London. Bruntwood provides inspiring workspaces and office environments across 140 buildings in the north and Midlands.Basing the team in co-working spaces “really helped us grow as an agency because it generates so many new leads,” she says. “There are always useful networking events happening, and there’s a customer community portal we can use to communicate with other businesses based in the same building who we’d like to explore working with.”As well as creating easily accessible networking opportunities, Rutter says working alongside other businesses in shared spaces has created a ready-made sense of community for her and her team, enhancing both professional development and personal wellbeing.“There’s a whole schedule of wellbeing programmes on offer that boost staff morale and encourage personal development, from yoga classes and free ice-cream to knowledge-sharing sessions where you can pick up new skills,” she adds.Networks play another important role – offsetting the sense of isolation that many business owners feel. Burnout is common among entrepreneurs, but having people to bounce ideas off or sense-check a piece of work can be enormously reassuring.“Loneliness is one of the biggest problems for the self-employed – particularly freelancers – but being part of a collaborative workspace allows you to build relationships with others in your position who understand the pressures of being in business,” says Carl Reader, author of The Startup Coach and The Franchising Handbook.“While friends and family understand that self-employment is different, they don’t always fully appreciate the challenges that a business owner faces every day. There’s also a business benefit from the new relationships you build – when business associates get to know you and your business, they can become a great source of new work. Sometimes, that’s the perfect medicine for the stress of self-employment.”From a psychological perspective, being part of a business network has had a “massive” impact on Rutter, offsetting the sense that she carries the full weight of the business on her shoulders and that there’s nobody to turn to for advice or input.“As a direct result of the workspaces we’ve used, I’ve made lots of friends who run their own agencies, and they’re the people I turn to when I lose a client or have a big win to celebrate,” she says.“I can tell friends about the challenges I’m facing and they’ll offer support and buy me a drink, but my professional network will offer support, buy me a drink, and then talk me through the practicalities of what I should do or how they dealt with a similar situation.”Ultimately, of course, people are employed to deliver results for an employer, which is why investing in their wellbeing is simply good business practice.“Happy, healthy people are the biggest asset to any business. Human beings aren’t just units of production, and workspaces that treat them as such create a battery hen experience where wellbeing suffers, presenteeism reigns and productivity drops,” says Toby Sproll, director of retail, amenity and community at Bruntwood.He points out that the way in which people work is evolving, and working environments need to reflect that. “New trends and technologies are changing workplace habits, so modern businesses need flexible workspaces, and that means the design of office buildings and the spaces within them have to have people at their heart.”Sproll says: “Work takes up so much of our daily lives – wouldn’t it be better if you could have some fun, learn something new, and potentially make a difference to your local community while you’re there?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcf4a5bdc6b5d02afe3fd6f82bd26b58c841f95e/0_380_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1744e794acc4430ea14dbf00e0277055","title":"its important to feel connected companies share their co working experiences","story":"Achieving a true work-life balance is notoriously difficult, whether you’re a working parent, first-time entrepreneur or a senior business leader.

That’s what enables you to recharge your batteries. Our office is designed so people can collaborate and talk to each other while working flexibly, but we encourage them to have their notifications turned off in the evenings. Most things can be sorted the next day. I switch off by playing music. One of our other members starts the morning with 30 minutes of meditation. Our people use their skills to improve their work-life balance too – one built an AI-powered tool to determine house price trends and bought his house accordingly. Another has worked out optimum travel times and accuracy.We don’t have assigned desks – we have a large community area where we mix with different people from different companies and we think that really contributes to maximising productivity.Antonio Giansante is co-founder and operations director of strategic design agency BGNWe set up this company with work-life balance in mind. We all have young families – I’ve got a six-month-old baby – and work-life balance to us means spending as much time as possible with them. We just don’t believe in working loads of hours for the sake of it. If you can’t do your work in 40 hours, then your business is not efficient. Eventually we’d love to implement a four-day week.We try to trust that our people will do their work. I think breakfast is very important, so we make sure everyone has everything they want, from potato cakes to cinnamon and raisin bagels. We also go for “family meals” once a month. You spend a lot of time with people at work, especially in a small team, so it’s important to feel connected.As long as you have the internet and a computer or your phone you don’t need much else. It’s remarkably easy for me to switch on and off from work. You know what? People can usually wait for a response.Simon Ramsden is a director at engineering consultancy Hilson MoranElectronics has changed how we work and I can sit for hours in an evening on my laptop. But in terms of how we run our office, we employ professionals and we’re paying them to do their job – not to sit in the same place for a set number of hours. Our staff work from home when they need to and our office computer system tells us if projects are on track. The days of finishing a meeting at 3.30pm and wasting time travelling into the office are over and we have to accept this.My problem is that my work is also my hobby, so if I am sitting thinking I could watch television, I’d rather be sorting out work instead. But I am genuinely happiest when I am not switched off. We had a staff meeting yesterday and I asked everyone how we could be more efficient. One of our tips was to use spreadsheets instead of Word. Engineers sometimes want to write reams of technical jargon that nobody has time to read, that can be communicated more succinctly. I’m happy if staff go to the gym at 11am to avoid the lunchtime rush it’s more efficient on their time. I’m actually out and about so much that it’s refreshing being back in the office. It helps that it’s a great place to work, designed and run as a WELL-accredited office. This has had a huge impact on staff satisfaction.Peter Brown is CEO of Notch CommunicationsI run two very erse companies, Notch Communications and a biotech company, Stream Bio, so I don’t sleep much. In fact, I sleep around four hours a night and have done for the past 30 years. I deal with a lot of major corporations in North America and being in the service industry you have to be around when they are working. I basically never go to bed on the same day I wake up, but constant trips across the pond mean I don’t get jetlag.When we set up Notch we wanted to employ some of the brightest scientific minds out of university, and if you take me out of the Manchester office the average age is 23. We’re not a 9-5 business, so we have to allow people to have time out during the day.I, personally, rarely stop working, but I love getting up in the morning. Even if I don’t always have time to go to the gym, I find a way to complete 10,000 steps in a day. I walk to the station in the morning and back in the evening and I leave the office for about 40 minutes to walk around the city, to ponder. You have to be mindful of stress levels when you’re in an industry like ours, so we encourage our staff to do as much as they can.

You also get to scale up without changing buildings, meaning you can concentrate on the work at handScaling a startup into a bigger business is hugely exciting for founders and their teams, and getting to that next level can depend on having the right ecosystem of support, contacts, community, and the right working environment.Firms based in co-working spaces or shared offices, for example, benefit on several fronts. The fact that maintaining the space is someone else’s responsibility frees up time for entrepreneurs to focus on growing their business. They can also access breakout spaces if they need headspace to think through an idea.However, the two key benefits these types of working spaces offer SMEs looking to scale up are flexibility and the chance to make valuable contacts, says Carl Reader, business advisor and author of The Startup Coach.“As your business grows it’s easier to move to a bigger office space within the same building, without the logistical issues that arise when you change your physical address and phone number,” he says. “You could find your nextdoor neighbour is the ideal person to help with the recruitment of your next team member, while the people you meet at the coffee machines may well be your next suppliers, customers, or even joint-venture partners.”Eagle Labs, part of Barclays UK Ventures, are dedicated co-working office and event spaces where businesses can work, attend technical events and participate in industry-focused transformation programmes. The flexible working environment supports the scale-up process, and promotes collaborative innovation across the entire entrepreneurial ecosystem.Location has been crucial to the progress of Wattl, a video platform startup launched in 2016. A year ago the company joined Mi-Idea, a post-accelerator programme run jointly by Bruntwood and Cisco, which included two years of free office space in the Bright Building located on Manchester Science Park. The move is already paying idends for the company’s growth prospects, says its co-founder Emma Ryan.“We’re a tech startup and we are bootstrapping, so this is much more than office space, it is also a huge source of support,” she says. “We’ve had opportunities to do pitching practice, and attend pitching competitions. Until now, all our focus has been on developing the platform’s technology, but we are at the point of needing investors, and there are events organised where we get to meet them. This is the ideal environment and ecosystem for our stage of growth.”Opportunities to meet other tech startups, all running different types of business, but facing the same issues and challenges, have also proved invaluable. “There is a sense of having support from those around you, and that you’re not on your own doing something that is really hard,” adds Ryan.Established in 2013, cybersecurity business Altinet has also benefited from its location in Bruntwood’s Platform building in central Leeds. Co-founder Henry Doyle says: “We are quite a young workforce, 20-strong and growing. This building, with its central location and amazing amenities, is allowing us to attract talent from the city and beyond.”Altinet is housed in its own office on the fifth floor, but its staff enjoy close contact with those of the 50 or so other companies based in Platform, making use of the mezzanine floor, a communal space complete with sofas, pods and coffee machines. They also take part in the many events organised by Bruntwood, from sports to breakfast clubs.Doyle says: “There’s a real sense of community, comprising of almost every service provider you can think of law firms, accountants, web designers, marketing agencies, and finance companies, all under one roof. It’s good to know that we also have space to grow – our office has room for another 20 people – so we don’t have to think about relocating as we move through this next crucial phase of growth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b6b234d7117a471f0b0b5195a99fc63b65f64a9/97_141_5243_3146/master/5243.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0b9fb3b4610cea8fa9784f40dfea2f2","title":"stuart broad jonny bairstow england sri lanka third test","story":"With the series against Sri Lanka won, Broad returns for the third Test in place of Jimmy Anderson, while Bairstow will become England’s fifth No 3 in the past five matchesThe B team are back. Jonny Bairstow and Stuart Broad are in the XI for the final Test in Colombo, starting on Friday. Having the luxury of an unassailable lead on an overseas tour for the first time since England’s visit to the Caribbean in 2004, the pack has been shuffled to allow these two stalwarts, who were compelled to wear their yellow bibs in Kandy, a resumption of their Test careers.It is fair to say Jimmy Anderson has been rotated, a concept England spend a lot of time talking about but seldom doing. With the series won they seized the chance to give Broad some Test cricket before the tour to the West Indies.Anderson does not like the idea of missing Tests but he understands. Moreover, it has been a frustrating series for pace bowlers. Anderson took one wicket in the first two Tests – the same applies to Sam Curran and Ben Stokes – and he lamented the lack of lateral movement either in the air or off the pitch while lauding the efforts of this England side in Sri Lanka over the past month. Bairstow is not a like-for-like replacement for Curran, who is still suffering from a side strain, and, if taking the short-term cricketing view, his inclusion lacks logic.On that occasion England were in the field for over 13 hours. In these circumstances a captain usually craves the extra bowler. England are going in to this Test with an extra batsman with Moeen Ali at seven and, rather surprisingly, Ben Foakes at eight. However, there is a longer-term yearning to sort out the batting order – and to reintegrate Bairstow.It was soon pointed out to Root that Bairstow will become the fifth No 3 in five matches. “Yes, and we have won all five‚“ he said. “We’re not the finished article we’re still learning and improving but we are going in the right direction. Sometimes you have to tinker with things to get to where you want to be. And if we don’t try, we don’t know.”Root described Bairstow as: “definitely a strong option at three and it’s an opportunity for him to nail down that spot. He’s more than capable of doing it. He bats up the order in white-ball cricket and one thing we know about Jonny is whenever he’s got a point to prove or he’s up against it he generally comes out and does something pretty special. Hopefully we’ll see that Jonny this week with that determination and drive to really hammer that spot home for himself.”So Stokes’ sojourn at three has lasted for one knock. After the use of a nightwatchman Stokes reverted to No 5 in the second innings in Kandy. “I stayed at four there because I wanted to split the left-handers up,” said Root, who reiterated his preference to remain at four for the foreseeable future, since this gives him a bit more “thinking time” after captaining the side in the field.“I think No 5 is Ben’s preferred position. Long-term he’s going to be bowling more in an English summer. So his workload will have an impact on his batting position. It wouldn’t be impossible for him to bat at three – he’s a very fit guy – but it might be a better formula to have him in the middle order.”England’s latest theory about their batting lineup has some merit. They now pick the best players and then decide which order to send them out. They may consolidate soon in a rather boring manner but for the moment the intriguing experimentation continues.The home side are still without important players. Their captain, Dinesh Chandimal, who has a groin strain, will not be fit enough to play in Colombo, while Akila Dananjaya, who took eight wickets in Kandy, will be in Brisbane this week undergoing tests on his bowling action.As a consequence the off-spinner Nishan Peiris has been drafted into the Sri Lanka the squad so too has Danushka Gunathilaka, an opening batsman recently disciplined for poor timekeeping. He could replace Kaushal Silva, who has struggled at the top of the order in this series."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38d2767844a0161a30d928e3c0770f313b3b8997/0_47_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=589f96c3d8d949d0293699caadef06be","title":"tom scudamore fit on course ride thistlecrack betfair chase horse racing tips","story":"Tom Scudamore has been passed fit to ride Thistlecrack in Saturday’s keenly anticipated Betfair Chase despite fears he might have sustained significant injuries at Cheltenham last Saturday. The veteran jockey was taken to hospital that evening and has not raced since, but he was cleared by the sport’s senior medical adviser, Dr Jerry Hill, after a series of tests at Oaksey House in Lambourn on Wednesday.“Obviously, I got a bit of a kicking from King’s Socks on Saturday,” Scudamore said. “They took me to hospital more as a precaution because I was a bit short of breath and they wanted to make sure I hadn’t punctured a lung or anything. That was all-clear, I had some x-rays and I just needed a couple of days off.”Scudamore said he never doubted that he would be fit to return to action at some point this week. Just the same, it is a relief to him that he will not be barred from continuing his association with Thistlecrack, on whom he won the King George VI Chase in 2016.No other jockey has sat on the horse in a race since he was fifth under Aidan Coleman in the Imperial Cup three and a half years ago. The following month, Scudamore and Thistlecrack won a Grade One at Aintree by a wide margin at 25-1.“I feel good,” the jockey added. “Been a lot better with each passing day. I was feeling a bit sorry for myself on Saturday night but I rode out yesterday and this morning. It was painful watching my brother’s horse win yesterday with someone else on it, but other than that it’s been fine.”Thistlecrack has been hampered by injuries in the last 18 months and punters are mostly sceptical about his chance of returning to top-class form on Saturday, making him a 10-1 shot against Might Bite, Native River and Bristol De Mai. “He’s looking well,” Scudamore reports. “I’m very happy with him, Colin Tizzard is very happy with him, but he’s got to go and show it. It’s going to be a tremendous race and there’s no reason we can’t be very competitive. He feels in a good vein of form but obviously it’s a different thing from going and doing it for real.”A decision is expected on Thursday on whether Might Bite will be partnered by his regular jockey, Nico de Boinville, who is struggling with a thumb injury. Noel Fehily is on standby to take the ride if needed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/761b0a95ada3928f02f2bba49c98b04f8f5fe453/0_84_1729_1038/master/1729.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a50e2c25f430a9a819261e58cef95caf","title":"world chess championship game 9 carlsen caruana","story":"A freshly bruised Magnus Carlsen came dangerously close to landing a decisive blow in Wednesday’s ninth game of his tightly wound defense of the world chess championship against Fabiano Caruana in London, until a moment of impatience allowed his opponent off the hook and left the best-of-12-games match no closer to resolution in a 4½-all deadlock.The 27-year-old champion, sporting a bandage over a black eye absorbed in a collision with a Norwegian journalist during a kickabout on Tuesday’s rest day, harried the American challenger out of his preparation early and pushed him to the brink of disaster in the middlegame, but one rushed misstep gifted Caruana the slack he required to hold for a 58-move draw with three classical games remaining and the gnawing spectre of a tie-breaker looming ever larger.“I felt like I had a comfortable advantage and then I just blew it,” a clearly disappointed Carlsen said in the immediate aftermath. “I was poor.”Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place at the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. No American-born player has won or even competed for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972.\u0026nbspIt marks the first title match between the world\u0027s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.\u0026nbspThe match will consist of 12 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion.The time control for each game is 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, 50 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 1. Players cannot agree to a draw before Black\u0027s 30th move.\u0026nbspIf the match is tied after 12 games, tie-breaks will be played on the final day in the following order:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• Best of four rapid games with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• If still tied, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment).\u0026nbsp• If all five mini-matches are drawn, one sudden-death \u0027Armegeddon\u0027 match will be played where White receives five minutes and Black receives four minutes.

Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bg2 Bc5 7. O-O O-O 8. d3 Re8) until he veered with 9. Bg5. The opening choice came as a bit of a surprise given how seldom Carlsen had played it in the past (only once in 37 previous classical games with Caruana prior to Game 4) and how frustratingly little he was able to mine from it eight days ago in a contest that quickly petered out to a straightforward draw.Carlsen’s deviation (9. Bg5) represented an aggressive effort to uncouple Caruana from the encyclopedic prep that’s buoyed him amply throughout the fortnight to date, but the 26-year-old American responded quickly for the next few moves (10. bxc3 f6 11. Bc1 Be6) until 12. Bb2 prompted the first long think of the afternoon. Caruana’s ultimate decision (13. ... Bd5) after 21 minutes was met by Carlsen’s 14. Qc2 after a scant 72 seconds and the world No 2 suddenly found himself more than a half hour behind on time before his 14th move.Caruana’s temporal complications were redoubled with his drastic and potentially dubious 17. ... Bxf3, which sent Carlsen’s advantage into a spike on the Stockfish evaluation engine.“I didn’t feel totally comfortable, (but) I thought if I started to drift it could get very unpleasant,” Caruana said of the choice. “I wanted to make it more concrete. Of course I’m basically admitting my position is very unpleasant, but still that the drawing margin is very high with these opposite-colored bishops.“I thought it would be easier to play if I simplify the position a little bit.”Carlsen, edge on time approaching an hour, made all the right moves, making equal exchanges of material while continuing to squeeze Caruana’s slowly diminishing position: 18. Qb3+ Kh8 19. Bxf3 Nxd4 20. Bxd4 Qxd4 21. e3 Qe5 22. Bxb7 Rad8 23. Rad1 Qe7 24. h4 g6. Little by little it seemed Carlsen, after eight draws in as many games, was inching toward a breakthrough win that would all but seal his third defense of the title he captured from Viswanathan Anand in 2013.And then he blinked.Carlsen’s hasty decision to offer a pawn with 25. h5 immediately prompted criticism from both the computers and the pundits. American grandmaster Hiraku Nakamura called it a “strange move” and “peculiar choice”, adding: “It feels a little bit premature to me.”That assessment was only confirmed over the next several moves (25. ... gxh5 26. Qc4 f5 27. Bf3 h4 28. Rxd8 Rxd8 29. gxh4) and from there a bloodless denouement appeared inevitable despite a patch of counterplay opportunities for the challenger that breathed a rattle of life into the winnowing proceedings. Eventually, the rivals shook hands after three and a half hours.“I was very happy with the opening, obviously,” said a downtrodden Carlsen, who extended a career-high streak of 14 straight draws stretching back to last month’s European Club Cup in Porto Carras, Greece. “You cannot expect more than what I had for sure.”The champion admitted he had “mixed feelings” about 27. Bf3: “On one hand it leads to a very comfortable advantage. On the other hand, as Fabiano said, it simplifies the game quite a lot. I felt like I wasn’t in time to do everything that I wanted. I just think (25. h5) was a a mistake.”An impassioned Carlsen bristled when asked by a reporter from Norwegian broadcaster NRK why he continued to persist for so long in the endgame despite the high likelihood of a peaceful result. When did he understand it was a draw?“I understood it immediately,” Carlsen said, voice rising. “It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t play. I’m trying to entice him to play h5 and if he does play h5 then I at least have a target. But obviously if he just keeps still and keeps his fortress just waiting for my king to enter then there’s nothing, but there’s no harm in playing. I really don’t understand the point (of the question).”Carlsen will be widely regarded as the favorite to retain the title in the €1m ($1.14m) match if the next three games end in draws, forcing a tie-breaker that under Fide’s match regulations consists of a series of games under tighter time controls. The Norwegian, who in addition to his No 1 ranking is the world’s top rated rapid player and top rated blitz player (compared to Caruana’s respective ratings of No 8 and No 16), is unbeaten in tie-breakers over the last 13 years. But the circumstance is one that Caruana is not willing to entertain just yet, and even less prepared to concede.“I’m really not thinking about the tie-break now,” said Caruana, who is attempting to become only the second American-born player to capture the world championship after Bobby Fischer in 1972. “If we get there then I’ll start to think about it, but there’s still a lot of chess to be played.”He added: “And I really don’t agree with most people about my chances in the tie-break.”Much of the chatter during the build-up to Wednesday’s game surrounded Carlsen’s black eye, which he’d revealed in an enigmatic Instagram post the day before with no explanation. Had the world No 1 fit a few rounds of sparring with Anthony Joshua into the rest day itinerary?Carlsen’s traveling physician, Dr Brede Kvisvik, confirmed the champion had suffered the injury to his right eye while playing football on Tuesday and was given ice to ward off swelling. No stitches were required.“There’s no concussion, as we had feared,” Kvisvik told NRK. “It looked worse than it was.”Carlsen, asked multiple times about the shiner in the mixed zone and during the press conference about whether it had any effect on the afternoon, offered the same terse response to each query: “No.”The players will have a quick turnaround before the competition resumes on Thursday at the College in Holborn with the Brooklyn-bred challenger playing as white in Game 10.“I would have loved to have win one game (so far),” Carlsen said. “But it’s not a disaster.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25d1d746261d23862bf732e3420b77b481afb4ac/0_136_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bde8f1d3da45cae56e409d763ad4280e","title":"facebook criticised for post promoting child bride auction","story":"Company failed to remove post that informed users of auction of 17-year-old girl for several daysFacebook has been criticised for failing to remove a viral post promoting an auction of a child bride in South Sudan, which eventually led to the payment of the largest dowry ever recorded in the civil war-torn country.The highest bidder was a man three times the age of the 17-year-old girl who was auctioned. At least four other men in Eastern Lakes state competed, including the region’s deputy governor, said Philips Anyang Ngong, a human rights lawyer who tried to stop the bidding last month. “She has been reduced to a mere commodity,” Ngong told the Associated Press, calling it “the biggest test of child abuse, trafficking and auctioning of a human being”. Everyone involved should be held accountable, he said.The girl, named as Nyalong by AP, became the man’s ninth wife. Photos posted on Facebook show her sitting beside the groom, wearing a lavish dress and staring at the floor.The groom, who did not respond to requests for comment, paid a final price of 500 cows, two luxury cars, $10,000, two bikes, a boat and some mobile phones.The bidding war caused local and international outrage.The auction was advertised but not carried out on the site, but it took several days for Facebook to remove the post that first promoted the auction. After it was taken down, other posts “glorifying” the auction remained, said George Otim, country director for Plan International South Sudan.“This barbaric use of technology is reminiscent of latter-day slave markets. That a girl could be sold for marriage on the world’s biggest social networking site in this day and age is beyond belief,” he said. Facebook did not reply to a request for comment.While South Sudan’s government condemns the practice of child marriage it says it can’t regulate communities’ cultural norms, especially in remote areas.“You can’t call it bidding as if it was an auction. It’s not bidding. If you see it with European eyes you’ll call it an auction,” government spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny told the AP. “You have to see it with an African eye, as it’s a tradition that goes back thousands of years. There’s no word for it in English.”Some local lawmakers and activists disagree. In a statement released this week, the national alliance for women lawyers in South Sudan called upon officials to comply with the government’s plan to end child marriage by 2030. Ending the practice includes putting a stop to the auctioning of girls.South Sudan’s anti-human trafficking chief called the case reminiscent of others he has seen across the country, in which girls are forced or tricked into marriage after being told they are going to live with relatives and go to school instead.“It is clear that some human-trafficking practices are hidden in our culture,” John Mading said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17c9047adcdc6c4d6c96dac2048e72e360ebba1e/0_56_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=143f0907b1e988c2820548d69bf6466d","title":"share your experiences of christmas festivities overseas you could win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Tell us how you spent Christmas on a trip to anywhere in the worldYou may have been to an inspiring Christmas concert, eaten local fare, taken part in unusual festivities in a far-off land – or spent the day on a remote tropical beach.Wherever you were in the world, please share your tales of a Christmas spent overseas.Please be specific about locations, and include prices and websites where appropriate.Read the terms and conditions"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4749a373519a58d73e9c16f499786c3074c5dc95/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a36569d45a8bb3151bd206166685423a","title":"our new column from inside amazon they treat us as disposable","story":"In The Amazon Diaries, our anonymous insider takes us behind the scenes at an Amazon fulfillment center where workers are ‘an extension of the machine’ Welcome Amazonians. It is always Day 1. Are you ready to make a difference?It was my first day as a seasonal Amazon worker, hired just prior to peak season. Our site operations manager was like many Amazon managers: an ex-military white male, in his late 40s and wearing straight-fit jeans and a T-shirt with “Amazon Military” emblazoned on the front. He drew a line alongside an inverted pyramid, writing “least important” on the bottom and “most important” higher up, with the word “customer” scrawled along the very top.“Where do you think Jeff Bezos sees himself on this chart?”Silence. He points to the bottom of the pyramid.“Jeff sees himself as the least important person in the company. What this company cares about is the customer promise, and putting our customers first.“Where do you think our associates are?”“Here! Jeff sees you at the very top! You, the associates, are the closest to the customers. It is up to you, every day, to uphold our customer promise. As front line associates, you are the most important part of this company!”As I headed to our training session wearing my new orange associate work-vest and wearing my white badge designating me as a “seasonal” employee, I was approached by a co-worker in a fancy, blue and green-lined “Ambassador” vest and a blue badge that signified he has been “converted” to a non-seasonal Amazon worker.“Did they give you the pyramid crap?”“That’s a load of shit.” We laughed, but I wasn’t quite sure I understood.“Welcome to Amazon,” he said.The inverted pyramid has stuck with me as an Amazon fulfillment associate. In some ways it’s on point. It’s important to take a step back and realize what an Amazon fulfillment center really is. Prior to Amazon, the sale of stuff largely took place through physical stores. Enter a store and there can be dozens of employees, stocking shelves, managing the check-out counter, controlling inventory. The pace and rhythm of the day, at least compared to fulfillment centers, can be relatively relaxed.At Amazon, by contrast, we are not retail workers. We are factory workers.A single fulfillment center can contain 1,500-2,000 full-time workers, stowing, picking, packing, unloading, sorting, palletizing and delivering hundreds of thousands of items every day. Centers are filled with the whirl, grind, and moan of conveyor belts, the incessant drone of a forest of Kivabots moving shelves.We work hard, and diligently, to make Amazon run. While our collective efforts produce astounding results, we are supervised ever more intensively. Through the use of digital trackers and indicators, our workday is managed down to the second, with each task timed based on a “rate” set by managers who push us ever faster. Work is often organized to keep workers from talking or even taking breaks, with this time considered “off-task”. Like factory workers on the assembly line, we are essentially extensions of the machine.When you recognize that we are what keeps Amazon going, and the most important part of the business, putting us at the top of the pyramid is right. Workers – whether the engineers or the hundreds of thousands of warehouse employees – are the backbone of the business and the source of astounding wealth. Without us there is no Amazon Prime, no advertising revenue, no streaming video, no HQ2.However, the pyramid analogy is also fitting because at the time this place feels like a pyramid scheme. After a few months at the company, it becomes clear to most of us that management doesn’t regard us a crucial contributors to its success. In reality, they treat us like disposable parts.It doesn’t take long before you’ve see blown backs, boxes falling on people’s heads, carpal tunnel in your coworkers’ wrists, and balky knees that never get better. You’ve seen workers compensation claims repeatedly denied and efforts to address safety issues given low priority. You’ve seen sexism, racism, and ageism in a promotion culture tainted with favoritism. You’ve seen write-ups unfairly distributed and used to manipulate workers. You’ve seen an emotionally toxic culture, where the stress of meeting productivity targets leads managers to treat workers like things, to be pushed harder and faster without regard for the emotional or personal cost. You’ve arrived home exhausted, too worn out to spend time with your kids or friends. And you’ve noticed that the wealth we produce is being accumulated by our boss – the modern world’s richest man – while our wages barely keep us afloat. Amazon’s much-touted new minimum wage of $15 is not enough to propel hundreds of thousands of us into the middle class.Those of us as at the bottom of the pyramid put our bodies and lives on the line, but those at the top of the pyramid are hung out to dry. The closer you are to doing the actual work of making this company run, the more your self-respect is attacked.Every other week, this column will seek to understand the complexity of life inside Amazon, and explore the effects Amazon has on our lives and on our broader community. Throughout, I want to remain consistent on one thing: Amazon workers deserve respect. As the people who make this company run, we are unique. And only if we are united will we be able to transform our company and our communities into the ones we want."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e95cbdae73183a811377e62a8ab8b8a64a7f3868/0_18_4281_2569/master/4281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b06c07190f975a44e0cbe37d6f321767","title":"asia bibi family being hunted house to house in pakistan","story":"Supporters appeal for family to be given asylum in Europe or north AmericaThe family of Asia Bibi, the Christian woman who spent eight years on death row in Pakistan for blasphemy before being acquitted three weeks ago, claim they are being hunted by extremists going house to house with their photographs to try to track them down.Bibi’s family have been in hiding since her acquittal by the country’s supreme court. She is in protective custody as part of a deal between the government and a hardline Islamic party, under which violent protests were called off while a review of the court ruling was undertaken.Bibi’s lawyer, relatives and supporters have appealed for the family to be given asylum in a European or north American country. Several countries have indicated their willingness to offer a home, but nothing concrete has emerged.John Pontifex, of Aid to the Church in Need UK (ACN), which has campaigned on Bibi’s behalf since she was convicted and sentenced to death in 2010, said he had been in almost daily contact with her family over the past three weeks and they were very frightened.“They have told me that mullahs had been reported in their neighbourhood going from house to house showing photos of family members on their phones, trying to hunt them down,” he told the .“The family have had to move from place to place to avoid detection. Sometimes they can only operate after sundown. They have had to cover their faces when they go out in public. They have had to remove the rosary that hangs from their car rear-view mirror for fear of attack.”Pontifex said the family’s faith was “sustaining them in this time of acute danger”. He added: “They say that if they are not allowed to find a future outside Pakistan, the fear is that sooner or later something terrible might happen to them.”Bibi’s lawyer, who fled Pakistan shortly after the court ruling saying his life was in danger, said this week that talks on asylum were under way with several European countries. “I hope the western world is trying to help her,” Saiful Malook told reporters in Frankfurt.Canada, Spain and France are thought to have offered asylum to Bibi. Germany and Italy have reportedly held talks with Pakistan on the issue.The UK government has declined to answer questions about whether it is considering an offer of asylum, saying it does not want to further endanger Bibi and her family.The former foreign secretary Boris Johnson and many other MPs and peers have called for the UK government to act. Some reports have suggested that the government fears a backlash among British Muslims of Pakistani heritage if it offers Bibi asylum.The Muslim Council of Britain said in a tweet: “There are unfounded media reports that Pakistani national Asia Bibi is being denied asylum into the UK because of concerns from British Muslims. We find such insinuations to be as nonsensical as they are isive. We see no reason why Asia Bibi should be denied asylum into the UK.”After Bibi’s acquittal, Islamic hardliners called for her and the judges in the case to be killed, and they mounted protests that brought cities to a standstill. Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan, has been accused of capitulating to their demands.Bibi, a farm labourer, was accused by Muslim villagers of insulting the prophet Muhammad in a row over a cup of water. The supreme court judgment said there was no evidence to support the charge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/344f2a0c76245c039c103dcc14cfc8e10ddee4f2/705_496_2092_1255/master/2092.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0849b902317292a1afb474a484bacc3b","title":"mattei salvini ready to confront eu after italys budget rejected again italy european commission","story":"Italy’s deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini has said he is prepared to confront EU leaders after the European commission rejected his country’s draft 2019 budget for a second time, while calling on them to “respect the Italian people”.Italy is facing sanctions after the commission said in a report that the government of the far-right League and anti-establishment Five Star Movement had seriously violated fiscal rules.Italy has about €2.3tn (£2tn) of public debt and the Bank of Italy warned this month that the cost of servicing the debt could rise to €5bn in 2019 and €9bn in 2020.Salvini, who leads the League, responded sarcastically to news of the commission’s report. “A letter from the EU? I’m also waiting for one from Father Christmas,” he told reporters.It is widely suspected that Salvini is exploiting the standoff to whip up anti-EU anger before May’s European parliamentary elections.The markets took the news in their stride. The yield gap, or effective interest rate, on 10-year Italian government bonds fell to 309 basis points above German debt within a few hours of the announcement.Wolfango Piccoli, the co-president of the research firm Teneo Intelligence,, said in a note that the Italian government was unlikely to adopt meaningful changes to the budget, which must be approved in parliament by the end of the year.But Piccoli warned that the wrangling could rumble on well into next year, saying: “Given the complexity of the overall procedure and the fact that political considerations might prevail ahead of the May 2019 European elections, Italy is not expected to face sanctions until late spring at the earliest, if they materialise at all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21fc2fe494d627c4da55f1241633e8409df8b93b/177_0_1687_1012/master/1687.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c95d252edce5ec20b072198a936f33db","title":"steve bannons rightwing europe operation undermined by election laws","story":"Exclusive: ambitious plan to campaign in EU elections would fall foul of laws in nine of 13 targeted statesSteve Bannon’s political operation to help rightwing populists triumph in next year’s European parliamentary elections is in disarray after he conceded that his campaign efforts could be illegal in most of the countries in which he planned to intervene.The former chief strategist to Donald Trump has spent months trying to recruit European parties to his Brussels-based group, the Movement, which he promised would operate as kind of a political consultancy for like-minded parties campaigning in the bloc-wide vote in May 2019.But the  has established that Bannon would be barred or prevented from doing any meaningful work in nine of the 13 countries in which he is seeking to campaign, according to national electoral bodies and relevant ministries. Confronted with the findings, Bannon acknowledged he was taking legal advice on the matter.“I’m not totally disagreeing with you,” he told the  in Paris. “I think there is more flexibility in some areas. But there’s no chance we would ever break the law.”Further disclosures about Bannon’s operation to foment a Trump-style populist insurgency in Europe are revealed in a  documentary.Bannon’s intervention in European politics comes amid heightened sensitivity about foreign involvement in elections. Questions have been mounting over the scale of Russia’s influence over the 2016 US presidential campaign and the UK’s referendum to leave the EU.However, in an interview with the , Bannon rejected the comparison between his movement and meddling by foreign states. “It’s very different from Russia, or Chinese, or other people trying to have influence, because I’m a private citizen,” he said. “I’m not associated with the White House.”A former investment banker with a reported net worth of about $50m (£40m), Bannon is personally bankrolling his European operation. He has pledged to spend millions of dollars to provide nativist and ultra-conservative European parties free access to specialised polling data, analytics, social media advice and help with candidate selection.But officials working on electoral law and independent experts in multiple countries said this kind of assistance would be considered in-kind donations.Professional services that have a monetary value and are provided by foreign sources are banned in France, Spain, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Finland. In Germany and Austria, in-kind services must be valued and are included in the limited sums parties may take from foreign donors.In October, Bannon told the  he had already spent $1m of his money on polling he planned to provide for free to parties in seven European countries. He described it as the most significant and most expensive political polling ever undertaken in Europe, and said it would be used by political consultants with experience in data analytics to help target voters in the European elections.By the time the elections conclude in May 2019, Bannon estimated, the project would have spent between $5m and $15m. There are no other known financial backers to his operation, although he has repeatedly referred to other unidentified donors who are “quite interested in what happens in Europe”. Asked recently if any of his donors were Russian, Bannon replied: “This will all be Europeans,” he said. “And me.”Bannon’s project was already in turmoil after parties he was courting in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic and Germany indicated they will not join his project. He now faces the challenge of persuading prospective recruits that they will not risk sanctions for receiving help from a Brussels-based group bankrolled by an American.Bannon insisted his operation was not failing and that he had time to recruit more parties. “Some people may not ever admit they’re signed up until after the European elections,” he said. “I’m doing all the polling whether there’s a country officially in or not. I’m doing all the data analytics whether the country is in or not.”The scale of legal challenges facing Bannon’s operation emerged six weeks ago, when his partner, the Belgian far-right politician Mischaël Modrikamen, told the  his own party was forbidden under Belgium’s electoral law from receiving contributions from the Movement. “It is a bit frustrating for me,” he said. “I would have loved to have a godfather … a benefactor.”A former corporate lawyer, Modrikamen confessed he did not know what electoral laws permitted in Germany, Italy or France, saying he was focused on recruiting parties to their operation. “For me right now I’m focusing more on getting the members,” he said. “I’m a bit frustrated because I have no time.”In the weeks since, the  conducted a review of the domestic laws in the 13 European Union countries in which Bannon and Modrikamen had signalled they wanted to operate. It revealed that parties in France, Finland, Belgium, Spain, Hungary and Czech Republic would risk sanctions for breaches of electoral law if they agreed to accept the assistance of the former Trump strategist.Parties in Germany and Austria can only accept such small sums that his war chest would be useless. Bannon’s activities would be permitted in Denmark and Sweden, but the parties he wanted to recruit in both Scandinavian countries have declined his offers of help.The only EU countries where Bannon has both willing partners and sufficiently lax electoral laws to allow him to boost party campaigns are the Netherlands and Italy.Bannon has poured most of his efforts into Italy, which elected a populist coalition government this year. His efforts to recruit the anti-establishment Five Star Movement have so far been rebuffed, but he has succeeded in enlisting the interior minister, Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League, and Giorgia Meloni of the smaller party Brothers of Italy.However, legislation being considered by the Italian parliament would prohibit foreign donations to parties in the country. Should it be passed into law as expected, Bannon’s grand European project would in effect be restricted to the Netherlands, where the anti-Islam MP Geert Wilders appears keen to cooperate.Informed about the findings of the ’s research, Modrikamen said: “There is certainly a problem, as you say, with contributions in-kind.” He added there may have been “some over-enthusiasm” in Bannon’s public declarations about turning the Movement into a nonprofit to help with campaigning in the European elections.When the findings were relayed to Bannon, during a meeting in Paris last week, he conceded that the polling, data analytics, and help with social media he had promised far-right parties in Europe may turn out to be unlawful. “We’ve got counsel looking at the same thing,” he said. “What we’re not going to do is anything that violates elections laws in those countries.”When it was suggested that Bannon’s European project may be restricted to providing campaign help to one Dutch MP, he replied: “It’s a start.”He added that if lawyers advised his operation was “close” to violating laws banning foreign interference “then there’s no chance we’ll do it”.Concerns about foreign influence on domestic elections have multiplied in recent months. In the US, the special counsel, Robert Mueller, is investigating the extent of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, including possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Mueller’s team has interviewed Bannon four times.In the UK, the National Crime Agency is investigating the former Ukip donor Arron Banks, after the Electoral Commission said there were reasonable grounds to suspect he was “not the true source” of £8m in funding to the Leave.EU Brexit campaign.Emails published by the Observer last weekend suggest Banks was keen to involve Bannon – a founder of Cambridge Analytica – in a scheme to raise US cash for his Brexit campaign as far back as 2015. Neither Bannon nor Banks has responded to the report.In his final interview before the Observer’s disclosure, Bannon, who spent much of October and early November campaigning for pro-Trump Republicans in the US midterms, insisted his intervention in Europe could not be described as foreign “interference”. “I think it is very different,” he said. “I’m not doing this as a White House guy. I’m not associated with the White House, I’m not associated with the Republican party.”Additional reporting by Kim Willsher in Paris, Josie Le Blond in Berlin, Sam Jones in Spain, Angela Giuffrida in Rome, Shaun Walker in Budapest, Christian Davies in Warsaw and Robert Tait in Prague."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcd78f817c75acfcab7f92abc2f9ef2eca2f21c9/120_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f602d0cdae8fdf20883ade0280b2e86","title":"bamboo house easy to build sustainable cubo wins top prize","story":"Earl Forlales awarded £50,000 for trying to address chronic housing shortage in the PhilippinesThe creator of a house made of bamboo that can be put together in four hours to solve the chronic shortage of affordable accommodation in the Philippines has won a £50,000 top prize to develop cities for the future. Earl Forlales, 23, a graduate in material science engineering, took inspiration from the bamboo hut his grandparents lived in outside Manilla.Forlales was awarded first prize by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) for his house, known as Cubo, for its use of low-cost, sustainable material, and the speed at which it could be constructed.John Hughes, the competition head judge and Rics president, said: “The world’s cities are growing all the time and there is a real need to make sure they are safe, clean and comfortable places to live for future generations.“There were many exciting, original designs among the submissions.

But after conservative groups rallied against the change, the government announced a referendum on the issue in August.As voting day nears, conservative groups have deployed a reported budget of 100m Taiwan dollars (£2.5m) in an effort to push the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman only. The group Alliance for Next Generation’s Happiness, which gathered enough signatures to trigger the referendum, voiced fears for society, with spokesman Tseng Hsien-ying saying: “The collapse of the family system will deal a huge blow to society.”Advertisements have blanketed Taiwan’s airwaves and newspapers. Misinformation has spread on social media, with same-sex marriage opponents claiming marriage equality would affect the island’s falling birthrate and make it a haven for foreigners with HIV who seek to use the national health system.Taiwan had been set to become the first country in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage when the island’s highest court said in May 2017 that barring gay couples from marrying violated “the people’s freedom of marriage” and “the people’s right to equality”.“Sexual orientation is an immutable characteristic that is resistant to change,” the court said in its ruling. “The freedom of marriage for two persons of the same sex, once legally recognised, will constitute the collective basis, together with opposite-sex marriage, for a stable society.”The ruling required same-sex marriage to be legalised within two years. While some form of legal recognition for same-sex couples is inevitable given the court’s ruling, conservatives hope to limit it to civil partnerships rather than amending the civil code on marriage.The situation has lead to a confusing ballot on Saturday, with a total of five questions related to same-sex life on the island, two with language in favour and three opposed. One of the questions concerns including LGBTQ material in the national curriculum, something conservatives hope to ban. It is unclear what would happen if several of the conflicting referendums pass.Taiwanese will also be voting on a range of other issues, from nuclear and coal power use to food imports from Japan to the name used in Olympic competition, which could potentially see Taiwan barred from the 2020 Games in Tokyo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/608e60c538296d1ba49e47ed0c334812a7b2ae55/0_86_4000_2402/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=397de78b366c515cabe290b98be299c6","title":"what next for the rohingya","story":"After repatriation plans stalled, there are fears that refugees in Bangladesh may never return to Myanmar Days after an attempt to begin the repatriation of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya in Bangladesh stalled, the future of the world’s most persecuted minority looks more uncertain than ever and concerns are growing that it will be years before they can return safely to Myanmar, if ever.Efforts by the Myanmar and Bangladesh government last week to begin the repatriation of the more than 700,000 Rohingya refugees living in camps in Cox’s Bazar fell apart after not a single Rohingya agreed to go back to Myanmar, leaving one of the world’s biggest refugee crises in a further state of limbo.The key obstacle for repatriation is that while most refugees are desperate to return home, the conditions in Rahkine state remain as dangerous and volatile as before the military crackdown in August 2017 which saw tens of thousands killed, women raped and villages razed, triggering a mass exodus.The Myanmar government declared last week it was ready to take back the Rohingya, and had built camps and reception centres to welcome them in batches of 150 per day. However there were no guarantees of safety, citizenship and freedom of movement that the Rohingya and international community consider essential for repatriation to begin.“I do not believe that Myanmar wants to take back the Rohingya,” Yanghee Lee, UN special rapporteur for Myanmar, told the  on Wednesday.Myanmar itself has stated that returning Rohingya would not be allowed to move beyond the Maungdaw Township area in Rahkine, one of the three areas they fled.“Talk of repatriation is very unrealistic right now and even more it is very dangerous,” Lee said. “Myanmar has not shown any real willingness to take back the Rohingya and despite all their talk about taking them back, that’s all it was, talk. They went though all that trouble driving them out and nothing has changed.”The volatile conditions in Rahkine may prove to be an unsurmountable stumbling block to sending the refugees back in the near future – one human rights groups and NGOs fear could be exploited by the Myanmar authorities to ensure the Rohingya remain in the Cox’s Bazar camps for years to come, if not permanently.Lee said even with reconciliation efforts it would be “years and years” before it was safe for the Rohingya to return because of “decades of discrimination against the Rohingya by law, by practice and by policy” that has entrenched anti-muslim sentiment in Rahkine. The situation remains so bad that Muslims in Rahkine are still fleeing to Bangladesh – 14,000 have crossed the border since January and the head of the UN fact-finding mission to Myanmar recently said that “genocide is still ongoing”.Lee’s pessimism was echoed by Mark Farmaner, director of Burma Campaign UK, who told the  that Myanmar’s public show of being ready for repatriation was a “charade” to ease international pressure, which has mounted since the UN fact-finding mission that concluded ethnic cleansing occurred in Rahkine state and the Myanmar military generals should be investigated for genocide by the international criminal court (ICC).“Of course Myanmar has no intention of taking them all back or reinstating their citizenship,” said Farmaner. “You can clearly see that they’ve only built camps to house around 30,000 Rohingya, the amount of refugees they consider to be a small price to pay to take back to get the international community off their back – but they certainly don’t want any more than that.”Farmaner said the promised pledge by Myanmar to bring back 150 Rohingya a day would mean repatriation of the million refugees in the camps, some who arrived before 2017 in previous outbreaks of violence, would take almost twenty years.Myanmar promises a pathway for Rohingya to citizenship, which was stripped away in 1982. However this will only be once the refugees have signed up for a National Verification Card (NVC), which most refugees are resistant to as it means an acceptance they are “foreign Bengalis” rather than rightful Myanmar citizens. Maungdaw district administrator U Soe Aung told magazine Frontier Myanmar this week that it would be “impossible” for all Rohingya to get citizenship.“It appears Myanmar is preparing permanent apartheid-like arrangements for the Rohingya, and any returnees from Bangladesh will just be funnelled into this system,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch.Meanwhile, Bangladesh is not prepared to accept that the one million Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar are staying put, and Bangladesh refugee commissioner Mohammad Abul Kalam told the  that repatriation “will definitely happen”. While Bangladesh has reiterated its promise not to force any Rohingya back over the border, multiple NGOs on the ground have privately expressed concern that the Bangladesh authorities might try and start restricting aid and NGO visas to Cox’s Bazar or spread misinformation to the refugees to persuade them to return.The insistence the Rohingya’s presence is only temporary has meant Bangladesh is reluctant to allow more permanent infrastructure in Cox’s Bazar camps such as schools for the hundreds of thousand of children. Caroline Gluck, spokesperson for UNHCR, said the longer they remained in the camps, the greater the risk of extremism, particularly among young men deprived of the ability to work.Bangladesh is still pushing forward with a plan to relocate refugees to a new camp on a silt river island, Bhasan Char, a proposal that has caused concern at Human Rights Watch and aid agencies because it is at high risk of floods. Kalam said any relocation to Bhasan Char would only happen “once the election is over”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3706189.1542835975!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"school structural defects state to take further legal action","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBuilders engaged in remedial work at Tyrrelstown Educate Together school in Dublin.  Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsThe Department of Education has indicated that it intends to take further legal action against Western Building Systems (WBS), the construction company at the centre of a controversy over structural defects in school buildings.The department last month said that “precautionary measures” would be needed at 22 schools built by the Co Tyrone firm, and considerable sums of money have already been spent on temporary repairs.Costs are expected to escalate in the new year when more detailed structural investigations of 42 schools get under way to determine the extent of work required to ensure all schools are safe.In a letter to the Public Accounts Committee, the secretary general of the department, Seán Ó Foghlú, said legal actions had , through the Chief State Solicitors Office, already been initiated against WBS “with regard to four school buildings that had presented deficiencies with regard to fire safety”.“The department would intend to take a similar approach in relation to structural defects, with a view to the State recouping remediation and other relevant costs,” he wrote.“The full scale and cost of remediation work required will not be clear until the next phase of technical investigations across the 42 schools has been completed. While legal proceedings are ongoing, the department will be limited in the extent to which certain aspects of the engagement with Western Building Systems can be referenced in public commentary.”Mr Ó Foghlú also said the department was committed to a review of its own design and build programme, which will be conducted by an independent person or entity.“We are also continuing to engage intensively with the school authorities across the 42 schools constructed by Western Building Systems to ensure that they are fully informed of developments relating to their schools. Our overriding priority through this process continues to be the safety of school students and staff.”Minister for Education Joe McHugh has said it was too early to determine the cost of repairs to schools, but said the scale of remedial work required to make 42 schools with structural concerns safe would require “big money” and a supplementary budget for his department.Labour TD Joan Burton said she expected the full cost could range anywhere between €50 and €120 million."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Soil scientists are looking at ways to reduce Irish farming\u0026rsquos reliance on nitrogen fertiliserConsiderable sums spent on temporary repairs to schools built by Tyrone firmIreland should follow model being pursued in Canada, Taoiseach saysVaradkar facing limited options if EU\u0026rsquos draft withdrawal deal with UK cannot be ratifiedIreland needs \u0026lsquoinnovative approach\u0026rsquo to reimburse cost of drugs to treat rare diseasesNational treatment programme to expand to reach more of the 30,000 infected with virusCharity supports bulk of BusConnects, calling investment and modernisation \u0026lsquocritical\u0026rsquoResearch lives: Dr Conor Brennan, associate professor, Dublin City University School of Electronic EngineeringMany coming forward to tell of alleged abuse said incidents were perpetrated on camping tripsTD says having vision to fight climate change important but it is hard to see one across GovernmentJoint statement advises public representatives \u0026lsquoto weigh their words carefully\u0026rsquoMinister warns of influx to North from Britain but Government loses vote 23-16Report from Coalition 2030 highlights major problems with housing and climate actionMinister for Climate Action Richard Bruton says Ireland might achieve 1 per cent reduction by 2020Only \u0026lsquobenign nature\u0026rsquo of surroundings prevented collision on flight to Corfu last yearIreland has potential to adopt \u0026lsquonature-based solutions\u0026rsquo such as the use of peatlands to capture carbon dioxide, climate expert saysGerard McEnery (56) pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing serious harmEuropean arrest warrant easier to execute"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3706066.1542827801!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin bus routes overhaul should make m50 central an taisce","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe plan promises to fully transition to a fleet of “low-emissions vehicles” by 2030, with half of the fleet transitioning by 2023. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins DublinThe redesign of the bus network should make greater use of the M50, An Taisce has said.The environmental and heritage charity said a “major oversight” in the proposed and existing network is the “minimal use” by buses of the M50.In its submission to the National Transport Authority (NTA) regarding the BusConnects plan, An Taisce said the proposals come “at a time when the need for a reform of Dublin’s transit system comes from several pressure points”.It said investment and modernisation of public transport infrastructure is “critical” in order to deliver radical and further reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.An Taisce’s Climate Committee said it supported the majority of the BusConnects plan, which includes the construction of core, high-speed bus corridors, the addition of orbital routes, integrated and simplified ticketing, the development of a network of high-quality cycling routes and park-and-ride facilities.However, it said one major oversight in the proposed plans is the minimal use of the M50, “which is by far the most important orbital in the city”.“In other cities of comparable size, for example Ottawa, Canada, the main city motorway artery or ring is critical to linking cross-routes and creating the vital network effect to ensure increased ridership, high modal share and reduced network subsidies,” it said.“In Dublin, planning to include the M50 as a major orbital route linking all major radial routes is surely critical to success of BusConnects.”Transport Infrastructure Ireland warned in its submission there may be “limited availability” within the existing national road corridors to accommodate some of the proposals. It pointed to a number of national roads that are proposed to be used for spinal and orbital bus routes, namely the M50, N3, N4, N11 and N81.An Taisce also said the BusConnects fleet acquisition process must prioritise “the very lowest emissions technology that is available and technically suitable”.It acknowledged the plan promises to fully transition to a fleet of “low-emissions vehicles” by 2030, with half of the fleet transitioning by 2023.“At the moment it is undetermined what low-emissions vehicles might mean, and the plan states that research is currently ongoing, which was also the message received at local information sessions,” it said.The charity said that despite gains for many Dublin residents, the redesign involves “an inherent trade-off with the accessibility for vulnerable groups such as elderly and disabled”.It said if the provision of additional services, such as a community transport service, were to be considered, “this trade-off simply disappears”.“An investment such as an urban community transport service would be in keeping with a sustainable transition which ensures that nobody is left behind by the network redesign,” it said.“Aside from being a matter of justice, this would also galvanise support for BusConnects, which has faced significant local scrutiny since the plan was released.”An Taisce said the integration of Dublin Bikes would be a “simple and sensible addition” to the multi-modal ticketing system.It added that financial incentives are important but that the BusConnects plan “seems to make no mention of discounted fares for regular users, such as weekly, monthly and annual ticket holders”.“This needs to be considered as a means of increasing patronage, in combination with measures to make driving more costly for those who do not need it,” it said.Some 30,000 submissions were received by the NTA in relation to the redesign of Dublin’s bus network when public consultation closed at the end of September. A revised network is due to be published by mid-2019, and a further round of public consultation will begin.Aside from a redesign of the network, the BusConnects project also involves upgrading 16 core bus and cycle lanes into the city. Earlier this month, details of the first four proposed corridors were released by the NTA."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3706178.1542835561!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach says government may have to negotiate a no deal deal in event of brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May with  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels.  Photograph: Olivier HosletEPA The Government and the EU may end up having to negotiate a Brexit “no-deal deal” with the UK government if the draft withdrawal treaty cannot be ratified, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.As nervous preparations continue for Sunday’s summit of European leaders, the British prime minister Theresa May left Brussels last night after meeting European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker reporting “good progress” on outstanding issues.However, she said she would return on Saturday for further talks in advance of the summit as there were “some further issues that need resolution”.Mrs May and Mr Juncker were discussing the political declaration on the future relationship between the EU and UK – a document which will accompany the withdrawal treaty agreed last week and which European leaders will formally agree on Sunday.But while the treaty is legally binding, the declaration is only a basis for future negotiation.On Northern Ireland, the political declaration is now expected to include language on the Border that will reflect Mrs May’s promise to explore technological solutions as an alternative to the backstop, which has proven controversial with eurosceptics in the Conservative Party and with the DUP.The withdrawal agreement, in both the draft produced in March and in its final form, allows for “alternative arrangements” to ensure the Border remains open.London is playing up the formula and high-level sources said that the EU side was likely to give Mrs May whatever assistance it could. But Government sources in Dublin insisted that the declaration did not affect the legally binding backstop in the withdrawal treaty.Amid fears that Mrs May will be unable to secure parliamentary backing for her deal with the EU, attention in Brussels and Dublin is turning to the consequences of a “no-deal” Brexit at the end of March.The Taoiseach yesterday told the Dáil that “no one knows for sure what would happen if there was one”.“It is my view that if we did end up with a no-deal situation, we would find ourselves having to negotiate a ‘no-deal deal’ quite soon thereafter. A no-deal situation might continue for a few weeks it might not last more than a few weeks.”Mr Varadkar indicated that while the Government would not prepare to erect border infrastructure, it would have to intensify preparations for a no-deal outcome.“It certainly could be a disastrous few weeks,” he said. “That is why we must think about these things.”He said that Ireland would be obliged to “protect the single market” but would have to do this without the erection of a hard border.“I think that in a no-deal scenario we would find ourselves having to come up with a deal,” Mr Varadkar told TDs.“We would have to come to some kind of agreement on regulations and customs to avoid a hard border in order that the UK honour its obligations as a member of the WTO and that we continue to honour our obligations as an EU member. The point I was making is that if we had no deal, we would find ourselves having to find a deal very quickly.”The Taoiseach also said the Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin “totally misunderstands” the DUP by telling the party that the deal represents the “best of both worlds”.“It is not the best of both worlds the DUP wants,” Mr Varadkar said. “The DUP holds very firm to the view that the most important thing is the integrity of the United Kingdom, the precious union. If this means a lesser world, that is acceptable provided that the integrity of the union is upheld.”The Taoiseach was also very critical of Sinn Féin’s efforts to secure a border poll.“Special arrangements in respect of customs and regulations for industrial goods should not be seen as a constitutional threat,” he said. “When people start to talk about Border polls, however, it really undermines the work we are trying to do to convince people that that is not what this is about.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3704748.1542739998!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"china s rise gives families and consumers more options","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCelebrating the Chinese New Year   in Yuyuan Garden: Many middle-class couples are opting to not take advantage of the relaxation of the restrictions on the number of children because it is simply too expensive. Photograph: GettyFor Shanghai residents Stella Zhu and Tony Wei, the biggest impact of the changes brought about by China’s economic rise over the past decades has been the fact that you have more choices than ever before.“In the past you didn’t have so many choices. Nowadays sometimes you have too many choices,” says Zhu, a 37-year-old lawyer.These options can be what food to eat, where to educate your children, even how many children to have. Zhu is about to have her second child, which until a couple of years ago would not have been an option for most urban residents in China.They do not know the gender of the child, because ultrasound scans are illegal, largely due to the preference for boys in rural areas which led to abortions of female foetuses. Zhu and Wei are happy to enjoy the surprise.“Initially it wasn’t allowed at all to have a second child, then because one of us is an only child, we were allowed to have a second, but now it’s all open,” says Zhu, who comes from Chongming Island near Shanghai. She is an only child, while Wei, who was born in Binyan in Guangxi province, has a younger sister.China’s economic rise in the past four decades has translated into a middle class that by the Chinese government’s reckoning is nearly 400 million strong. Consumer spending now accounts for more than 60 per cent of economic growth in China.Wei runs a media company. He left his home town when he was 18 and went to study in Changchun. “I’ve never been back to live in my hometown. The city life is very different,” he says.Both are well-travelled – Wei rode a motorcycle to Berlin from China last year – and prefer to use their English names for this article.Although they are well-off, financial concerns were a factor when deciding on how many children they would have. Many middle-class couples are opting to not take advantage of the relaxation of the restrictions on the number of children because it is simply too expensive.Both came of age during the period of reform.“Maybe there has been a revolution in the past 30 years, it’s a very big difference. Maybe if I was born in a small town in the earlier days, I would be working in a factory. There are more chances for me to change my life now,” says Wei.The social changes have also been felt in rural China.One young woman, who asked to be referred to by her family name Shu, was born in 1997, the year Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule, in a village called Jinxiang, about three hours from Shenzhen, in Guangdong province.Shu has two boys, aged four and two, and she lives in a house with her husband’s parents.Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong, has undergone several transformations over the years, from fishing village to manufacturing centre to high-tech hub, and the recent opening of the world’s biggest sea bridge is expected to boost the Pearl River Delta even further.Here, as everywhere else in China, education is incredibly important to Chinese parents. With a population of nearly 1.4 billion, the pressure to succeed is intense. There are more than half a million schools, with 265 million students in the largest public education sector in the world.“China’s economy is very good now and we don’t have the same kind of burdens as before. I hope my boys can go to the city, maybe not Shenzhen as it is very expensive, but at least study in the city near my village. Then the boys will have the opportunity of going to university and have a stable job if they stay in the city. If they come back here, they can start a business, so they can make more money,” she says.Both Stella Zhu and Tony Wei joke about wanting their son Owen to be a football star and go to Harvard, but Zhu worries about being a “Tiger Mom” and having too high expectations, putting their children under too much pressure.“I have no idea about what Owen will do. Some Chinese parents put crazy pressure on their children. But maybe in two or three years, I will also become like those crazy parents,” she says.Wei’s parents are still in Guangxi. When his parents come for Spring Festival they stay for a couple of weeks, but it’s a big adjustment for them. “They find Shanghai very different, they have different habits, they don’t like big cities,” he says.Zhu’s mother is 72 and lives with the family. “My mother’s generation is very different. In the old times, they didn’t have so much food or consumer items. At home she always wants to control how much we cook. She likes to put all the food in the refrigerator, sometimes for months. She puts it in there and she feels safe,” she said.“The older generation cares about money because in the past they were too poor. I tell my mother not to worry about money so much, it’s more important that we are happy, that we have good food and are healthy. But she always says we spend too much money and need to save more money,” she says.She believes people are much happier now than when she was a child.“Compared to my childhood, life is much better and much more relaxing,” she adds.She is open to what her children want to do in the future. “I think I will let them decide. They can do whatever they like as long as they don’t do something bad or become criminals. It doesn’t matter much how much money they make,” she says.Stella Zhu is also looking forward to the future with hope. “It’s not like when we were younger, because now we have chosen our way. For me, my future is to work hard, continue as a lawyer, do better in my career, and of course you can earn more money and make your family life better.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3706076.1542831047!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"very good progress in brussels as brexit talks go to the wire","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker meet to discuss Brexit draft agreements  in Brussels on Wednesday. Photograph: Yves HermanReuters Theresa May will return to Brussels on Saturday for further talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker after a meeting on Wednesday failed to finalise a crucial draft joint political declaration on the EU-UK future relationship“Very good progress” was made at Wednesday’s meeting, the commission said in a statement, on a document that is expected to be approved alongside the withdrawal agreement at an EU summit on Sunday. Work was continuing, the commission said, with Mrs May adding later that there were “some further issues that need resolution”.Mrs May arrived at about 5.30pm local time and shook hands with Mr Juncker, refusing to answer shouted questions, and after the meeting disappeared without comment. Commission officials were saying next to nothing. All sides appeared to accept that the withdrawal agreement (WA) cannot be reopened and that Sunday’s summit will effectively just rubber-stamp it. Mrs May acknowledged as much in the Commons on Wednesday, while German chancellor Angela Merkel told the Bundestag there was no question of renegotiating the deal now.Mrs May’s focus on Wednesday night was on the final tweaking of the declaration, which she hopes to sell to her sceptics as providing the reassurances and safeguards they are looking for and believe are lacking in the WA.On Northern Ireland, the political declaration is now expected to include language on the Border that will reflect Mrs May’s promise to explore technological solutions as an alternative to the backstop. The withdrawal agreement, in both the draft produced in March and in its final form, allows for “alternative arrangements” to ensure that the Border remains open. London is playing up the formula.But she also gave a new version in the Commons on Wednesday of how the backstop could be creatively interpreted – the government, she said, could agree to keep the entire UK aligned with EU regulations rather than allowing Northern Ireland to erge from Great Britain.“If we were in the situation where the backstop had to be in place for a matter of months, for example, it would be right for the United Kingdom to give the commitment that we would not be looking to erge from regulations during that period and that we would ensure that we kept that free access for the goods from Northern Ireland coming into Great Britain, as we have committed in the withdrawal agreement . . . and as we had committed previously. That will of course be a decision for us here,” she said.Nature abhors a vacuum and so Brussels was swirling with rumours and talk of “serious” blockages on the road to agreement on the declaration. Diplomats were sceptical of how serious such threats are.Spain has threatened to veto the deal if its concerns on Gibraltar are not met. And there are still reported to be French and other objections to the omission in the declaration of commitments to access to UK fishing waters and what some see as a dilution of “level-playing field” guarantees in the trade section.One senior diplomat said of the Spanish problem that “It should be all right on the day. An issue like this will have to be sorted beforehand.”Berlin weighed in to give the deadlocked discussion a kick forward, suggesting that a deal on the declaration needed to be finalised on Thursday, in time for capitals to consider it ahead of Sunday, or Dr Merkel might not attend the summit. After Mrs May’s statement on Wednesday night that timetable will not be met. But it was a clear message to Spain and others obstructing the deal that they should not be jeopardising the agreement and that there is limited sympathy for their stanceIt also appeared to be a message to London that any talk of negotiations on Sunday is out – the summit will be a formal approval of both documents and little more. Downing Street has been briefing unofficially that Mrs May hopes to engage in negotiations. Not if Dr Merkel has her way."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

It’s taken nine years of work to get here, and it’s a hundred years since the ionic wind was first discovered”.In the tests, the battery-powered unmanned aircraft, that weighs just five pounds, managed sustained flights of 197 ft in an MIT gym hall.Professor Barrett was inspired to launch the project after watching sci-fi series Star Trek as a child. He was especially impressed by the show\u0027s futuristic shuttle crafts that skimmed through space with just a blue glow and silently glide.The project was inspired by the shuttlecraft featued in sci-fi series Star TrekThis made me think, in the long-term future, planes shouldn\u0027t have propellers and turbines, he said. They should be more like the shuttles in Star Trek.Ionic wind, also known as electroaerodynamic thrust, was first identified in the 1920s and explored by scientists and engineers in the US and at Britain’s Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough in the 1960s, but they were only able to produce very low levels of thrust, insufficient for flight.To overcome this obstacle, the MIT test aircraft carries an array of thin wires strung beneath the front end of its wings. A high voltage current passed through the wires via a lightweight power converter strips negatively charged electrons from surrounding air molecules.This produces a cloud of positively charged ionised air molecules that are attracted to another set of negatively charged wires at the back of the plane, like a giant magnet attracting iron filingsAs they flow towards the negative charge, the ions collide millions of times with other air molecules, creating the thrust that pushes the aircraft forward.One of the biggest challenges faced by the MIT team was designing a power supply that would generate 40,000 volts from the plane\u0027s battery output, one of the biggest stumbling blocks in adapting the technology for large-scale commercial use.Prof Barrett told the  that while it will take “several decades” for the technology to be advanced enough to power passenger aircraft, unmanned aircraft with wing of up to 80 ft will be possible in the nearer term.The silent aircraft has obvious applications as a stealth drone, as it would not be detected by infrared scanners. Defence giant Lockheed Martin has reportedly already expressed interest in the project.Guy Gratton, an aerospace engineer and visiting professor at Cranfield University, said: “It\u0027s clearly very early days: but the team at MIT have done something we never previously knew was possible, in using accelerated ionised gas to propel an aircraft.  “Aeronautical engineers around the world are already trying hard to find ways to use electric propulsion, and this technology will offer something else that in the future may allow manned and unmanned aircraft to be more efficient, and non-polluting.”Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)Please review our commenting policyHead of Russia\u0026#39s military spy agency accused over Salisbury attack dies after illness at 63British

type two diabetes is nearly ten times higher than previously thought, new analysis reveals.Campaigners expressed shock last night as it emerged the real tally of those with the life-threatening disease is approaching 7,000.Earlier this year figures from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health sparked concern when they indicated there were 715 people under the age of 25 in England and Wales living with the condition.Traditionally the lifestyle-related condition was only seen among older adults, often those overweight or obese.It was only in 2000 that the first recorded diagnosis of a child with type 2 diabetes took place.However, a new analysis by the charity Diabetes UK for the first time took into account data from GP surgeries, showing the true number receiving treatment to be far higher.The condition is much more aggressive in children and young people than in adults, with a higher overall risk of complications that tend to appear much earlier.Diabetes UK warned that thousands more children and young people could be diagnosed with the condition over the coming years, as the latest figures on childhood obesity show that more than a third of children in England will be overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school.It has called for better specialist support for youngsters with the condition to help manage their illness and reduce their risk of serious complications.How to | Manage and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetesMeanwhile, it backed proposals for a ban on junk food TV advertising aimed at children before 9pm, and to restrict supermarket price promotions for unhealthy foods.Bridget Turner, director of policy and campaigns at Diabetes UK, said: Type 2 diabetes can be devastating for children and young people.To help shape a future where fewer children develop the condition, we need continued commitment across society to create an environment that reduces obesity.We need to encourage healthy living by providing clear and easy-to-understand nutritional information about the products we are all buying, and protect children from adverts for foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar.At the same time, we must look after those who already have the condition so they can avoid serious complications such as amputations, sight loss, stroke and kidney failure.Children and young people with Type 2 diabetes should have access to expert treatment by healthcare professionals trained to manage and research the condition and the challenges it presents.Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, added: For many children, the development of Type 2 diabetes can be prevented with lifestyle changes, but this isn\u0027t easy - they need support.That\u0027s why we were pleased to see the ambitious proposals set out in Chapter 2 of the Childhood Obesity Plan - we urge the Government to maximise their impact by introducing them all and doing so quickly.Ten areas in England are piloting new ways to encourage residents to take more exercise, and slim down bulging waistlines.Three of the towns have announced plans to ban junk food from the streets surrounding schools.It comes as 12 major housing developers signed up to plans to expand the programme nationwide, with “health and wellbeing” measures included in all new housing developments and regeneration schemes.Darlington has drawn up plans to ban takeaways selling hot food from within 400 metres of schools, by the end of this year.Barton, in Oxfordshire, has now introduced a ban on any licenses to those wanting to sell hot and cold food, drinks or confectionery, within 100 metres of a school, between 7.30am and 6pm.Head of Russia\u0026#39s military spy agency accused over Salisbury attack dies

Independent TechAmazon has suffered a customer data leak less than two days before Black Friday.Amazon customer service contacted people to warn them that their names and email addresses had been compromised, though it is not yet clear how\u0026nbspmany customers were affected or how it happened.\u0026nbspAn Amazon spokesperson told\u0026nbspThe Independent:\u0026nbsp“We have fixed the issue

Apple has traditionally resisted Black Friday, instead running small offers but not slashing prices or offering deep discounts.In the last couple of years, for instance, the company has just offered gift cards when people bought specific products. Those gift cards have to be spent in the Apple Store and the products still sold at full price.Apple said almost nothing about this year\u0027s deals. It announced them with a mysterious set of phrases, reading only: Four days. Special offers and making clear the dates.As such, Apple\u0027s own website does not traditionally offer the best deal on the company\u0027s own products. Better offers can often be scored through other retailers – and a complete list of the best of them can be found in this list.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This is a long way from the lofty predictions that some analysts forecast for bitcoin this year, with many having forecast a return to the $20,000 price it reached at the end of 2017.But while some cryptocurrency analysts have revised their predictions, others have stood by their figures in anticipation of a major market turnaround in the coming weeks.Follow the latest bitcoin price updates on\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s\u0026nbsplive blog.One of the most optimistic predictions comes from Adam Back, co-founder of the blockchain firm Blockstream, who said\u0026nbsphe anticipates gains that will take bitcoin\u0027s price to more than 100-times today\u0027s value.Personally I consider $250k-$500kBTC plausible in the years ahead, Mr Back said on Twitter in response to fellow cryptocurrency enthusiast Bobby Lee, who himself speculated about whether the overall value of bitcoin could overtake the overall value of gold in the coming years.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

Increased institutional backing, he said, would help turn bitcoin\u0027s fortunes around.CoinMarketCap)Other analysts have taken a more retrospective look at bitcoin\u0027s recent turmoil, saying that such significant price movements are not surprising given the cryptocurrency\u0027s history.What we’re seeing now are the after-effects of the unprecedented rise of Bitcoin and other cryptoassets seen in 2017. This year is simply a retracement of that. The same is happening in broader markets as well where tech stocks, for example, are following a similar pattern. As with all markets, if prices reach levels that are higher than can be justified they need to pull back, Mati Greem, an analyst at the online trading platform eToro, said in an email to\u0026nbspThe Independent.These cycles can sometimes be accentuated in the crypto market due to the riskier nature of this nascent industry. In the same way previous cycles have not signalled the end for broader markets, these price movements don’t signal the end for cryptoassets. We’re still very much at the beginning of the crypto journey.

We are bound by European rules – as are the Dutch, the Belgians and the Irish,\u0027 he saidBrexiteers are “not telling the truth” when they claim France would not need to impose onerous and costly border checks on imports of UK produce in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the President of the Normandy region has said.Some Brexiteers have argued that because the UK and the EU are currently fully aligned in terms of food and plant standards it would be unnecessary for France to check UK produce entering the EU after 29 March 2019, even though Britain would suddenly be a “third country”.This is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look likeAnd some have even sought to argue that the imposition of such checks would be illegal under World Trade Organisation rules.Lord Lilley, a pro-Brexit former UK trade and industry secretary, suggested this in an interview with the BBC’s Today programme on Monday, as he sought to play down the economic risks of leaving the EU without an agreement.But Hervé Morin, President of the Normandy region and a former defence minister in the cabinet of President Nicolas Sarkozy, insisted on Wednesday that such checks would be unavoidable due to EU customs union and single market rules.“The British are sovereign, but it’s the European rules we apply in France,” he told The Independent, speaking at the French ambassador’s residence in Kensington, central London.“It’s a decision that stems from the EU. We are bound by European rules – as are the Dutch, the Belgians and the Irish.”“Anybody who says something different is not telling the truth.”The prospects of such checks is deeply worrying for UK for UK farmers.The National Farmers Union president Minette Batters said in September that crashing out of the EU would be an “Armageddon scenario” for British farmers.Trade experts agree with the reading of Mr Morin and dismiss the claim that WTO rules forbid new checks.“The EU is obliged by the WTO to treat the UK as it treats other third countries. That is, with many more frictions than the UK faces at present as a member of the EU,” says Alan Winters of the UK Trade Policy Observatory.Normandy is home to a number of major ports, including Cherbourg, Le Havre\u0026nbspand Caen, serving both the tourist and business trade.Mr Morin said that there were “huge challenges” to get the infrastructure in place for future customs checks, even assuming the UK enters a 21-month transition period in March 2019.“There’s a lot of stake economically,” said Mr Morin. “Customs will have to be set up, capacity will have to be increased.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The IFT is billed as ‘non partisan’ but its ‘advisory board’ is nonetheless made up of a smorgasbord of Conservative yesterday’s men and women. Former Tory leader Michael Howard, former Spanish PM José María Aznar and former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott are prominent among them.There’s also Ben Sasse, the Republican Senator from Nebraska, who claims to be an independent conservative but has voted with the decidedly anti free trade President Donald Trump 87 per cent of the time, per an analysis by FiveThirtyEight.\u0026nbspHannan has managed to find some business types to sit with the think tankers on the ‘executive board’, such as Brexiteer blowhard Lord Digby Jones, a former CBI chief who now lives on another planet to most of its members.The ITF has offices in London, near the Embankment, where they can meet together with an august corps of ‘fellows’ and a PR agency for the purposes of making ‘the moral case for open commerce’.\u0026nbspGiven its ostensibly idealistic aims, you might think that the ‘private iniduals, commercial and non-commercial organisations’ putting their hands in their pockets to advance its aims would be only too keen to shout their association with it from the rooftops.If I were contributing to an outfit whose cause, we are told, ‘is the ultimate instrument of poverty alleviation, conflict resolution and social justice’ I’d certainly want people to know about it.\u0026nbspStrangely, however, that’s not the case for the funders of Mr Hannan’s group.\u0026nbspHere’s the answer I got to my question on the subject: “The majority of our income comes in the form of donations from private iniduals.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

We are bound by European rules – as are the Dutch, the Belgians and the Irish,\u0027 he saidBrexiteers are “not telling the truth” when they claim France would not need to impose onerous and costly border checks on imports of UK produce in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the President of the Normandy region has said.Some Brexiteers have argued that because the UK and the EU are currently fully aligned in terms of food and plant standards it would be unnecessary for France to check UK produce entering the EU after 29 March 2019, even though Britain would suddenly be a “third country”.This is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look likeAnd some have even sought to argue that the imposition of such checks would be illegal under World Trade Organisation rules.Lord Lilley, a pro-Brexit former UK trade and industry secretary, suggested this in an interview with the BBC’s Today programme on Monday, as he sought to play down the economic risks of leaving the EU without an agreement.But Hervé Morin, President of the Normandy region and a former defence minister in the cabinet of President Nicolas Sarkozy, insisted on Wednesday that such checks would be unavoidable due to EU customs union and single market rules.“The British are sovereign, but it’s the European rules we apply in France,” he told The Independent, speaking at the French ambassador’s residence in Kensington, central London.“It’s a decision that stems from the EU. We are bound by European rules – as are the Dutch, the Belgians and the Irish.”“Anybody who says something different is not telling the truth.”The prospects of such checks is deeply worrying for UK for UK farmers.The National Farmers Union president Minette Batters said in September that crashing out of the EU would be an “Armageddon scenario” for British farmers.Trade experts agree with the reading of Mr Morin and dismiss the claim that WTO rules forbid new checks.“The EU is obliged by the WTO to treat the UK as it treats other third countries. That is, with many more frictions than the UK faces at present as a member of the EU,” says Alan Winters of the UK Trade Policy Observatory.Normandy is home to a number of major ports, including Cherbourg, Le Havre\u0026nbspand Caen, serving both the tourist and business trade.Mr Morin said that there were “huge challenges” to get the infrastructure in place for future customs checks, even assuming the UK enters a 21-month transition period in March 2019.“There’s a lot of stake economically,” said Mr Morin. “Customs will have to be set up, capacity will have to be increased.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

When public assets are gone, they\u0027re gone - in the case of this first student loans sale, for too little return.”She added:\u0026nbsp“It is troubling that the Government could have expected to recoup the £1.7bn sale price in just eight years.“Decisions on asset sales must fully consider value for money but I am not convinced that this transaction, with its narrow and short-term objective of reducing public sector net debt, is fully compatible with that principle.”\u0026nbspA Government spokesperson said: “We are confident that we achieved value for money for taxpayers from the first sale of student loans.As the National Audit Office has found, we received more for the loans than the value to Government of retaining them, further strengthening the public finances.“Student loans are designed so that borrowers only repay when they can afford to - this gives more people the chance to go to university and get on in life, but, as the Public Accounts Committee recognises in its report, this also means many students will never fully pay back their loans.“We welcome the report from the Committee and will issue a full response in due course.”Department for EducationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

And fees are also spent on student welfare and widening participation.\u0026nbspHowever, about\u0026nbspa fifth of the income is spent on things that students are less keen on, according to HEPI.The report shows that Nottingham Trent University spends a total of £740 of each student’s annual fees on finance, marketing, HR, policy and planning, alumni and the vice-chancellor’s salary.\u0026nbspHowever, the paper concludes: “It is clear there is some distance left to travel before all students have access to clear and comparable information.”The report calls on the government, regulators and institutions to make changes to increase transparency on the use of students’ tuition fees – and it suggests renaming\u0026nbsp“tuition fees”\u0026nbspas “student fees”\u0026nbspto reflect better how the money is spent.Students to be offered two-year degrees to cut cost of tuition feesHalf of students considering studying abroad over \u0027high\u0027 tuition feesEU students in England will pay same tuition fees year after BrexitThe analysis is published\u0026nbspjust weeks after reports have suggested that tuition fees in England’s universities could be cut to £6,500 a year as part of the government’s review of post-18 education.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspNick Hillman, the director of HEPI and a co-author of the report, said: “Tuition fees were introduced 20 years ago and they have been tripled twice.“Ministers and regulators have repeatedly demanded information on where the fees go. Yet there is still little information available and three-quarters of students want to know more.”He added: “The arguments for telling students what they want to know are overwhelming. Where this has already occurred, it has tended to show less than half of the fees go on the direct costs of teaching but most of the rest does go on student-facing activities.“Any reduction in the headline fee cap is therefore likely to hit students hard –\u0026nbspunless every penny were permanently replaced by other funding, which history suggests is exceedingly unlikely.”Jim Dickinson, a co-author of the report, said: “Students and their unions have been clamouring for information about where their fees go for years – yet despite nudges from government and sector bodies, research suggests that little progress has been made.“Fears that increased transparency will lead to dissatisfaction are unfounded –\u0026nbspand regardless of the balance between the state and student in funding higher education, students want and deserve to know where the money goes.”Shakira Martin, president of the National Union of Students, said: “When students are paying such a high price to access higher education, it’s no wonder that many are demanding a greater transparency to how money is spent.”She added: “There clearly needs to be much more accountability built into the system –\u0026nbspto that end, providers publishing a breakdown of where fees go would be a good place to start.\u0026nbspThere must also be a greater student involvement in the decision-making process where money is to be invested.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Student news in pictures Show all 34Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.South Korean policemen detain student protestors during a protest against South Korean President Park Geun-Hye outside the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea.Filipino demonstrators face off with anti-riot police during a protest near the US Embassy in Manila, PhilippineHundreds of protesters including Indigenous People, students and militant groups marched towards the US Embassy to protest against the presence of US military troops and condemning the violent dispersal which left at least forty people hurt including twenty police officers and three people who were run over by a police vanA federal judge in Mexico has ordered that a once-fugitive police chief be held on charges of kidnapping in the disappearance of 43 studentsA man holds up a photograph of a missing student with a caption reading \u0027We are missing 43,\u0027 during a meeting marking the 25-month anniversary of the disappearances of 43 students in the southern state of Guerrero, in Mexico City.

This Government recognises the importance of this area and is increasing the information available to students to ensure they can make informed choices about what and where to study.“We think universities should follow suit which is why in February 2018 we asked the OfS to work with the HE sector to improve transparency, so that students know what they should expect. The OfS will play a key role in ensuring students have more information and guidance to help them effectively challenge providers who do not deliver on their commitments.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Pandora, small by moon standards (50 miles or 81 kilometers across) is elongated and irregular in shape. Mimas (246 miles or 396 kilometers across), a medium-sized moon, formed into a sphere due to self-gravity imposed by its higher massAn X1.6 class solar flare flashes in the middle of the sun in this image taken 10 September, captured by NASA\u0027s Solar Dynamics ObservatoryAn image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013A false colour image of Cassiopeia A comprised with data from the Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescopes and the Chandra X-Ray observatoryAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory.

On this mission, Kathryn Sullivan became the first U.S. woman to perform a spacewalk and Marc Garneau became the first Canadian in space. The crew of seven was the largest to fly on a spacecraft at that time, and STS-41G was the first flight to include two female astronauts1730 A Fresh Perspective on an Extraordinary Cluster of GalaxiesGalaxy clusters are often described by superlatives. After all, they are huge conglomerations of galaxies, hot gas, and dark matter and represent the largest structures in the Universe held together by gravityNasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope has unveiled in stunning detail a small section of the Veil Nebula - expanding remains of a massive star that exploded about 8,000 years agoThe arrangement of the spiral arms in the galaxy Messier 63, seen here in an image from the Nasa Hubble Space Telescope, recall the pattern at the center of a sunflowerThe spectacular cosmic pairing of the star Hen 2-427 — more commonly known as WR 124 — and the nebula M1-67 which surrounds itFour images from New Horizons’ Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) were combined with colour data from the Ralph instrument to create this enhanced colour global view of Pluto2230 Fresh Crater Near Sirenum Fossae Region of MarsThe HiRISE camera aboard Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter acquired this closeup image of a fresh (on a geological scale, though quite old on a human scale) impact crater in the Sirenum Fossae region of Mars.

Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceshipupper stage \u0026amp Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth’s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons), a follow-up read.The spaceship – whatever its name – is SpaceX\u0027s big hope for the future of space travel. The company hopes that it will eventually replace not only the existing modes of deep space transport but its existing rockets and spacecraft, too.Eventually, SpaceX\u0026nbsphopes to use the Starship to carry people to Mars, where they will live, and possibly even beyond. In the shorter term, the company is aiming for a 2023 mission that will see a Japanese billionaire pay for a host of space tourists to take a trip around the Moon – if the Starship, which will cost around $5 billion to build – is ready in time.Starship is actually the spacecraft\u0027s fourth name. Before it was known as the BFR, the spaceship was known as the\u0026nbspInterplanetary Transport System or ITS – and before that it was called the Mars Colonial Transporter, or MCT, marking it out as part of Mr Musk\u0027s plan to send people to take over Mars.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Instead, on the Privacy page, you have to click on Limit Past Posts, then select Limit Old Posts and finally hit Confirm on the pop-up.39 Make yourself harder to findYou can stop completely random people from adding you by selecting Friends of Friends from the dropdown menu in the Who can send you friend requests? section of the Privacy page. It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps. The list might be longer than you expected it to be.

Those are intended to make it easier to cut down on how much time you spend there.That includes a feature where users can set a daily reminder when they\u0027ve gone over the amount of time they want to spend on Facebook. That reminder can be for whatever amount of time, and can be easily dismissed when it arrives – but is intended as a quick way of nudging yourself to get off the app.But it also allows people to easily unfollow pages and unfriend people so that their news feed is a more healthy place to be. Clicking that option will show a host of pages that you might want to hide from your timeline, for instance.The new tool works much like the Your Activity page that was recently\u0026nbsplaunched on Instagram. A range of different companies – including both Google in Android and Apple for iOS\u0026nbsp– have launched similar tools, graphing usage in an attempt to ensure that people are using the services safely.It comes amid increasing concern about the damage social networks and other technology are doing to the people who use them.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But 4K is already old news, after Samsung revealed its first 8K TV meant for consumers – doubling the name, quadrupling the number of pixels on offer and heralding the future of screens.Samsung\u0027s newest television crams a full 33 million pixels into a vast display that it hopes becomes the ultimate way of watching the TV. Despite how it might sound, 8K is actually four times as many pixels as existing TVs, and offers what the company says is a significant improvement and innovation on that technology.But the 8K TV isn\u0027t only the consequence of wanting to cram in more pixels or to add bigger numbers to specifications. That sort of thing is largely pointless anyway, because at a certain point those numbers fail to matter: once you have enough pixels in a small enough screen, the eye can\u0027t actually see anymore and so the extra ones aren\u0027t visible anyway.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightIn fact, it is at least partly the result of a growing trend among consumers: buying much bigger televisions. As the screens expand, so must the number of pixels, if companies want to keep a consistently good look – and so the 8K TV starts at 65, going all the way up to 85. (That vast screen, big enough to fill the wall of a small living room, will set you back £15,000.)And so expanding TVs has left companies like Samsung racing not only against the latest spec numbers and pixel counts, but to ensure that their displays are high quality enough to cater for the vast sizes that people are buying them in.We\u0027re seeing a trend towards larger screen technologies, says Stuart Mayo, Samsung\u0027s director of TV and AV, speaking at the launch of the new displays. People have moved from 32 inches to 55 inches as the average screen size now.Part of the reason that people are embracing bigger TVs is that while the screen has grown, the rest has gradually fallen away – the big bezels and backs that often came attached to the display itself have disappeared. That means that people can fit much more screen in the same amount of space, and that the TVs themselves aren\u0027t quite so ugly, meaning that the average display size has quickly shot up.And so you are convinced, encouraged to drop £15,000 on a television roughly the size of a single bed. But then you start to worry that all of those huge numbers might mean nothing if you only end up watching broadcasts of the same 4K – or, most likely, 1080p at best – content that you have been viewing all along.There\u0027s no reason to be concerned, says Samsung: the TV is smart and beautiful enough to analyse that video and make sure it looks its glorious best on your vast new television. The arrayed computing power in the 8K TV allows it to upscale whatever content it is given and fill in the quality gaps to make it look right at home on the vast new displays.Yes, we have 8K coming out before we have a huge volume of 8K content, says Mayo. But you\u0027ll be able to enjoy everything at the world\u0027s best quality.It upscales any of the content you love watching today. So Netflix box sets, the rugby world cup, the olympics – our TV allows you to upscale any of that content and it will be superior.Hidden behind all TVs is what is perhaps the really important part: a processor that is the engine room of the TV and delivers the picture experience that appears on the display itself. Making the 8K TV has largely been made possible by advances in that kind of technology that allows the whole set to be doing far more work, and more smartly: inside of the television is artificial intelligence that can analyse the huge images, take them apart, and then use its technology to work out how best to show them.However beautiful and lush the TVs look when they\u0027re doing their thing, there is one ugly fact that remains true no matter how smart they are: that they are an unfortunate obelisk of black when they\u0027re turned off. That gets even more of a problem as the TVs get bigger and take up more space, swallowing up rooms with their big black void.Samsung thinks it has a fix for that, too, with its ambient mode. As well as allowing the television to be helpful even when you\u0027re not watching anything – by showing news headlines or other updates, for instance – it has something that Mayo refers to as its chameleon feature. Users take a picture of the wall behind the TV and the display then replicates that, allowing the television to effectively disappear. As TVs get bigger and more beautiful, Samsung is also working to make sure they can be a little more invisible, too.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For years, the US has been unable to launch its own astronauts to the space station or anywhere else – instead relying on Russia to do so for them – and has been waiting and hoping for private solutions to the problem.The historic launch will take place on 7 January, 2019, Nasa said.Nasa video says it is going back to the Moon –\u0026nbspand staying thereThis will be the first uncrewed test flight of the Commercial Crew Program and will provide data on the performance of the Falcon 9 rocket, Crew Dragon spacecraft, and ground systems, as well as on-orbit, docking and landing operations, it said in an announcement.The flight test also will provide valuable data toward NASA certifying SpaceX’s crew transportation system for carrying astronauts to and from the space station.No astronaut has been launched into space since 2011, when the Space Shuttle programme was retired. Since then, all launches have happened at the Baikonur\u0026nbspCosmodrome, which is run by Russia – a situation that has occasionally caused problems, such as fears that no missions would be able to launch after a major issue with a recent trip to the International Space Station.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

I can\u0027t say exactly how we solve this issue, but I hope it will be solved by Sunday.The EU is due to hold a summit to discuss Britain\u0027s draft Brexit deal on that day.Angela Merkel speaking in Germany on May\u0027s Brexit deal (Image: )Angela Merkel delivers a speech to parliament (Image: )Merkel said her government regretted but respected Britain\u0027s decision to leave, adding: We want - and that is in our fundamental interests - to have a good relationship with Britain in the future too.On the Irish \u0027backstop\u0027, an insurance policy to avoid a return to controls between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU state Ireland, she said this presented a situation that was very, very difficult to solve.I think rightly, we have placed value on Britain not being able to decide unilaterally when it ends the customs union, but rather that Britain together with the EU defines this date and afterwards the future relationship comes into effect, she said."},{"url":null,"title":"royal","story":"CAMILLA Parker Bowles’ first boyfriend described his former lover as not good looking, an...MEGHAN Markle paid a subtle tribute to the late Princess Diana during her tour of Australia,...SARAH Ferguson has once again spoken of her charity work and how it helped to ‘save’ her life...PRINCE Harry will leave pregnant Meghan Markle at home next week as the Duke of Sussex carries...MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry are celebrating their six-month wedding anniversary tonight by...MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry joined Kate and Prince William for a double date at the Royal...MEGHAN Markle was a very different royal bride-to-be than Kate Middleton, Sarah Ferguson and...CAMILLA takes centre stage in new pictures released to mark Prince Charles’s 70th birthday, as...PRINCE Charles is celebrating a milestone today - his 70th birthday.

But they kept quiet when signing us up in  and when holding the first referendum in .Voters were betrayed from the start.

So he refused to hold it.His successor Gordon Brown, never big on honesty when a lie served him better, pretended this Lisbon Treaty was too insignicant to bother voters with.The EU is founded on deceit. “When it becomes serious, you have to lie,” says President Jean-Claude Juncker. Voters are bullied into reversing inconvenient referendums or denied a say at all.And so to Mrs May, the Brexit deal her Cabinet agreed last night and the revealing EU leak yesterday which makes crystal-clear Brussels’ intentions to keep us in its vice-like grip for ever.That plan being to lock us into its Customs Union for all time, unable to make our own trade deals, powerlessly swallowing its orders and obeying its rules.Our Government knows we cannot legally escape this central pillar of the EU — which we voted to “leave”, remember — without consent from Brussels that it will never give.This is not some minor afterthought, to be bargained away, which is why MPs rejected it in July.

I’m prepared to cut the  series some slack, though, for two reasons.First, it is purely a temporary pairing and, second, ITV has promised me Noel Edmonds, who shouldn’t just have been the first one in the camp, he should’ve been choppered in about eight years ago, when the contestants started all this “bonding” rubbish, which has ruined more series than I care to remember.Oh, what some of them could’ve done with a one-man feud generator like Noel, whose Wikipedia entry will give you a fair idea of his inner turmoil even before you get to the bit where he says: “When I die, my energy willto where it came from.” Ilford He’s also got a le-size mannequin doll called Candice, who accompanies him everywhere and would be a more than welcome replacement for a few of the camp mates, who’ve got a bit of a Rita Who and Knob Too feel about them this year.The knob part of that equation, fairly obviously, is all-singing, all-dancing John Barrowman “MBE” , who described himself as “fabulous”, “an icon” and “down-to-earth” within the space of one sentence, on Sunday, and was wrong on every count.He also hit on the yacht waiter, using one of his dance moves.“It’s a pas de bourrée. Kick ball, change and turn. Can you do that ”“I’m not allowed.”Not even the kick balls bit Shame. He needs someone to calm him down.Although, as horrendous as it must be to live with, I don’t mind Barrowman on I’m A Celeb, as the show does need a massive irritant to get under everyone’s skin.On similar grounds, I also welcome EastEnders’ Rita Simons, who looks like she might have a tantrum or two in her, Nick Knowles, who will be incapable of stling his Sir Galahad complex, and Harry Redknapp, just because he’s Harry Redknapp.Of the others The public jury’s probably still out on Emily Atack and The Chase Governess Anne Hegerty, who “used to be a Brownie”, as well as eating a lot of them.Mentally, though, I have already completely written off Coronation Street’s Sair Khan, some bloke off Hollyoaks, The Vamps’ James McVey and X Factor’s Fleur East, who arrived dressed as a dispatch rider for the first episode.Possibly for the very good reason she’s now working as one.This might sound like a hasty and fairly damning assessment, I realise, but compared to some series, four solidly promising bookings isn’t actually a bad .What it very clearly needs, though, is Edmonds, because, without him, Sunday’s opening episode, for all its high adrenaline thrills, became a bit of a drag.It usually does, of course, as the celebs haven’t yet let their guard drop.But, in this instance it meant the spotlight fell on Holly Willoughby, and you quickly realised Dec hasn’t had to work this hard since he tried bouncing jokes off Hogan the Koala.Just as Edmonds could turn out to be a massive disappointment, Holly Willoughby could get the hang of I’m A Celeb, obviously.At the moment, though, her one signicant contribution came after the parachuting challenge when she asked: “How come Shane had a helmet and Emily didn’t ”’Cos the bloke was doing all the hard work and she was just hanging around.Buckle up, Dec.Alastair Campbell’s far-too-frequent Good Morning Britain appearances always proving as welcome as a turd in a swimming pool.Strictly stars forever banging on about reaching Blackpool without ever mentioning it means they get paid more.Every wretched, product-placing second of the entertainment on Friday’s Children In Need.And particularly EastEnders’ big song-and-dance routine, which had the Disney Company’s Angela Affinita claiming: “We have Letitia Dean actually interacting with Mickey Mouse.”Good luck with that one, Mickey.IF you want to know just how brutally British republicans would mistreat the Royal Family,they ever came to power, just take a look at what those who claim to love them the most do to the Windsors now.Stuff like We Are Most Amused And Amazed, a th birthday tribute, hosted by Armstrong  Miller, on ITV, that probably left the future King Charles III thinking Charles I got off lightly.Two hours of canned laughter and pick-a-card-any-card magical tw*ttery with the likes of Sandi Toksvig, who took  seconds to remind us she’s gay, Omid Djalili, who took an entire  seconds to remind us he’s Iranian, and Rowan Atkinson, who rather set the evening’s tone by announcing: “As the more perceptive of you will have noticed, this is hell.”There was a family of German illusionists as well, which I thought was a bit insensitive, given the royal circumstances, plus Sooty  Sweep and a lot of grovelling from randoms, like Cheryl Tweedy and Kylie Minogue.Presumably because they could both be guaranteed to keep a straight face when describing the birthday boy as “a style icon” and “philanthropist”.Then, at the end of it all, dear old Charles shuffled on, waved and thanked everybody.And he may even have meant every syllable of it as well, given that Alexander Armstrong thrilled the Palladium crowd by deciding not to sing.Truly, the Royal Family is the most wondrous thing.Jenny Eclair: “The last thing any woman needs, during or after the menopause, is a bothersome vagina.”Tough, you’ve got one for another  minutes.MEANWHILE, desperate times call for desperate means at the rugby, as England trail Japan - and Sir Clive Woodward suggests: “We’ve got to start using our physicality, just outside the rucks, to suck these Japanese guys.”A WELCOME antidote to all of the lazy, repetitive, biased, hideously self-satisfied and right-on comedy broadcast by the BBC and Channel  finally reappeared, on Saturday night.Michael McIntyre’s Big Show, on BBC, which has to be the most perfectly judged hour of television, all year.A quota-free joy that’s warm, funny and has mainstream appeal, without ever being too cloying, safe, predictable or slick, as you will have noticed when Lionel Blair completely sabotaged the “Unexpected Star” reveal, in a pop-up Zimmer frame shop, with -year-old David Owen.“Say hello to David,” McIntyre whispered into his ear-piece.“Hello David!”Pause. “How does he know my name’s David ”Well, quite. Among his other gts, though, Michael McIntyre, above, has the ability to charm and ad-lib his way out of these situations, which gives his Big Show a seat-of-its-pants feel, despite being one of the most carefully structured formats on television.As anyone with a brain can see, in fact, it should be the blueprint for almost everything BBC comedy does.So I can pretty much guarantee, this time next year, Have I Got News, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order will still be telling us how much they hate Brexit and Donald Trump and someone from the BBC, on £, a year, will be assuring licence-payers: “Sara Pascoe is the future of comedy.”Pointless Celebrities: “Hi, I’m Luisa Omielan and I’m a comedian.” Bless.And Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “I don’t think the word ambition applies to me. I don’t have any ambition.”WHO said the following on live TV, last week “The colon has been mobilised and we’re very close to the moment the bowel’s coming out.”A Nicky Campbell on Channel ’s Removing The Tumour B Theresa May in Downing Street Joe Lycett: “Measuring the strength of earth-quakes, the Richter scale was invented by Charles who ”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Between Newcastle and Gateshead, the King Edward Bridge spans what river ”And Joe Lycett: “Nicola Sturgeon, a Scot or a fish ”Kristy: “A fish.”MICHAEL McIntyre’s Big Show. Paddy Considine, Jessica Raines and Bel Powley all performing brilliantly in BBC’s Informer.Channel ’s strangely addictive and reassuring live operations series, with Nicky Campbell.Prime-Minister-in-waiting Johnny Mercer MP breezing through Celebrity Hunted, without dear old Kay Burley to encumber him.Scotland playing olé football against the mighty Albania.And the politically incorrect brilliance of the response Chase contestant Bethan gave to Bradley Walsh’s question: “The name of what German ­company comes from the name of founder Adolf Dassler ”“Hitler.”Compiled by Graham WrayGary Neville: “Lingard has his hands in his head.”Michael Dawson: “It’s an unexpected start for Spurs because they didn’t expect that.”Trevor Bayliss: “We’ve come to Sri Lanka to play in conditions which are foreign to us.”And Paul Merson: “A poor finish from Vardy, but that’s him at his best.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Like .million others, I voted for Brexit on the basis thatthe EU wouldn’t give us a mutually beneficial deal then we would simply leave without one.It’s now clear that, despite the clear mandate from . per cent of the British people that they want out, the painful preication of Mrs May’s “negotiations”has told the Brussels Eurocrats that our government is wavering on that mindset and, consequently, they feel they have us over an imported barrel.So it’s time to show them that they don’t — by openly preparing for no deal. After all, the notion that Merkel, Macron et al will bite off their own electorate’s noses to spite Britain’s volte face on EU membership is an absolute nonsense.In a letter to The Times yesterday, the chairman of pub chain JD Wetherspoon, Tim Martin, wrote: “The great urban myth, promoted by advocates of the deadly exchange rate mechanism, the euro and Remain, is that a ‘deal’ with the EU is a prerequisite of future prosperity.”The reality, he says, is that no deal would allow us to join successful countries such as Canada, Singapore, Israel and Australia in the free-trading world and “by slashing the EU’s , protectionist tarfs, shop prices will fall, with no loss to the Treasury, since tarf income is currently remitted to Brussels”.On top of that, we won’t have to pay the £billion orce bill, will regain control of our fishing waters, borders and laws and, ultimately, all have more money in our pockets.

Or, in John Sergeant and Ann Widdecombe’s case, common moths in freefall after a battering from a tea towel.But former Pussycat Doll Ashley is used to performing complicated dance routines in front of huge crowds and, therefore, oozed confidence and expertise from the get go.Little wonder since, according to her former dance teacher in the US, she was taught “all dferent styles of dance” from the age of eight to  and once had an introduction to ballroom training by an elite dance company at summer school.So yes, she’s undoubtedly the best, with former Steps trouper Faye Tozer not far behind. But the true Strictly stars are all the others who improve each week despite being way outside their comfort zone.FOLLOWING the shocking attack of a female PC being karate-kicked to the ground by a thug, the flippant commentary accompanying the footage is indeed sickening.But at least the film might help secure a prosecution and hopefully prove a turning point in how we take back control of our lawless streets.Because the real problem here is the fact that thugs clearly don’t fear the consequences of their actions.So may I humbly suggest that it’s high time the Home Office toughens up and shows, not tells, our hard-pressed police that they now have the power and support they need from on high to do their job effectively.CHECK out poo guru Gillian McKeith out on the town with her smiling -year-old daughter Skylar.Considering my daughters won’t be seen dead with meI wear anything more risqué than a baggy polo neck and tweed maxi skirt, she’s very fortunate indeed.THE £.

In , we expect our national broadcaster to reflect all our opinions even-handedly.We don’t want the BBC to tell us that one side is right and the other wrong, or what we should believe, or which opinions are “true” and which are “”.But that is what the BBC has started to do, at least on the subject of Brexit.The BBC tried to be reasonably balanced during the referendum campaign, but it was so upset by the outcome that it has abandoned any attempt at impartiality and become grotesquely one-sided.The views of Remainers are not just over-represented, they are rarely challenged. And scare stories about Brexit which are either exaggerated or completely imaginary are presented as fact.I decided to compile a list of myths about Brexit — particularly scare stories about what will happen when we leave the Customs Union orwe leave Europe without a deal.Then I compared them with the facts. Although the pamphlet did not mention the BBC, most of the myths were things we hear daily on its programmes.The BBC rose to the bait and invited me into the Today programme on Radio  yesterday to be grilled by John Humphrys, its star interviewer. It was a fair enough interview. He challenged my arguments but I was able to refute his claims point by point.However, they then brought on a chap called Chris Morris, described as the BBC “reality checker”, who was invited to rebut my document. But all he did was oppose my facts with the opinions of people with whom he agreed.He systematically argued the Remain case and defended their Project Fear scare stories. The one thing he did not do was bring in any new facts. My central claim was thatwe leave the EU Customs Union but have a free trade agreement with the European Union, our businesses have little to fear.The main dference will be that traders will have to send in a customs declaration detailing the goods they are buying from or selling to Europe.That is a nuisance which we should try to simply as much as possible.But allegations that “this will be hugely costly, cause y delays, disrupt supply chains and undermine economic growth” are imaginary or exaggerated.“Fact checker” Morris said the majority of trade experts and freight companies to whom he had spoken robustly disagreed with me. This is an opinion, not a fact.Surely,trading in a free trade area — like that which exists between Switzerland and the EU or between Canada and the US — is so intolerable, the people there would be calling for a customs union.But they aren’t. I prefer their practical experience to the speculation of Mr Morris’s contacts.I also quoted a report by the CLECAT organisation, which covers , companies handling  per cent of the freight and customs in Europe, who said: “All the ingredients to ensure a smooth exit process of the UK from the EU, and which allow almost frictionless trade after the exit, are already available.”Why should a BBC fact checker’s unnamed contacts count for more than their considered view He then claimed there are no checks at the border at present. I go across to my house in France frequently and see the checks — for drugs, illegal immigrants, alcohol, cigarettes.And companies have to report all their cross-border trade separately on their VAT s and provide statistical s to Brussels.Then Mr Morris claimed there would be more checks by our customs officers at Dover, resulting in delays and disruption. That is nonsense.The Head of Customs and Revenue has said it only stops and searches lorries at present where it has intelligence information about drugs, illegal immigrants, and goods such as tobacco and alcohol, upon which excise duty is paid.It does not expect any of these risks to become more frequent. So it will not need to search any more vehicles.As I was still in the studio, I was able to rebut his pathetic attempts to rebut my facts. Normally he gets a clear run.But what is intolerable is that he almost never tries to rebut arguments by those trying to overturn the referendum result.I asked him afterwards to name a single Remainer whose case he had attempted to dissect. When he replied that there were “lots”, I said it should be easy to name one and, after repeated challenges, he named Jeremy Corbyn.The idea that Mr Corbyn — a man who has voted more often against European membership than any other MP and went on holiday during the referendum — is a Remainer could only be taken for reality by a BBC reality checker.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Access to our waters for fishing is also a crucial sticking point.Angela Merkel warned today that the vital get-together on Sunday still hangs in the balancethe details arent signed off by TONIGHT - urging other leaders to stop scrapping.The German Chancellor said: Well hopefully have a European Council on Sunday to sign the exit treaty and discuss future relations.But she vowed that Britain wont be able to leave a customs union deal without Brussels say-so - in a blow for Brexiteer hopes that the withdrawal deal can be altered.She told the German parliament: We have placed value on the fact Britain cant decide unilaterally when it ends the state of the customs union, but that Britain must decide this together with the EU.European capitals are unwilling to thrash out last-minute details at the Sunday meeting itself, and wont speak to Mrs May until its almost over.Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis set Friday morning, when EU leaders chief advisors meet in Brussels, as the deadline for a final text - although Mrs Mays comments this evening seem to have scuppered that.He said: Well need to have agreed beforehand on the Political Declaration on the future relationship and were not there yet.The Commission stands ready to consider the text and take any action at any time.An EU diplomat told The Sun: Its nobodys intention to make [Sunday] a negotiation summit. No Merkel, no summit.If No  feels it needs a negotiating one and is willing to risk another Salzburg, they hold the keys. But the appetite for risk here is low.The PMs spokesman said: A summit has been called, an agenda has been published and we look forward to attending.But the spokesman refused to confirm that the meeting will definitely go ahead as planned.Chancellor Philip Hammond tonight predicted that relations will run more smoothly once the withdrawal agreement is signed - with both sides investing more trust in one another.He told ITVs Peston: I hope that once we get this deal done there will be more trust, more openness and more willingness to progress.Earlier today Mrs May warned her MPs that her deal is the only way to avoid a isive second referendum on Brexit.The Prime Minister told the Commons it must opt for her deal or risk no Brexit at all.She told MPs at Prime Ministers Questions: If you look at the alternative to having that deal with the European Union, it will either be more uncertainty, more ision, or it could risk no Brexit at all.Mrs May said she would continue to negotiate on that future partnership during her meeting with Mr Juncker.She was asked repeatedly by Tory MPs to go back and renegotiate, with one Brexiteer urging her to cut away the tentacles of the EU for good.But she slapped down the colleagues who want to try and change her deal, said there were three clear ways to get out of a never-ending customs union - and called on MPs to back it when it comes to the Commons.This morning the Prime Minister was warned she must squeeze extra Brexit concessions or her deal will get torpedoed in the Commons. A Tory source said: The Chief Whips view is that fear of No Deal will not be enough to win this one.They went on: The numbers are terrible and he needs something sufficiently dferent from what people currently think they are voting for in order to get this through.But new DWP boss Amber Rudd suggested that Nos strategy of pressuring MPs to vote for the deal because of the fear of nothing at all wouldnt work.In remarkable comments this morning she insisted that there was no majority in Parliament for No Deal.She also said she believed thatMPs voted down the deal, Parliament would prevent us leaving with nothing at all in place.Ms Rudd, who took over from Esther McVey last week, told Radio  that MPs should take a fresh look at the deal once Mrs May comes back with it later.This is the cake, its been baked, the Prime Minister will bring it back... perhaps that will remind colleagues that there is still a negotiation going on, she said.The news came as:It is believed that the Brexiteer rebels are still a few letters short of the  needed, and yesterday Mr Rees-Mogg admitted it had all gone a bit Dads Army - and warned a coup against her could come next month instead.And Cabinet ministers could get behind a new technological solution to solve the Irish border issue - as first revealed by The Sun this week.Mrs May told her ministers yesterday the country could avoid having to use the controversial Irish border backstop after Brexit because of a new plan to avoid a hard border with alternative arrangements of technical solutions away from the border.The current document on our future partnership with the EU is just seven pages long, but Cabinet ministers were this week shown a -page draft which was to be discussed between Mrs May and Mr Juncker today.The more flesh we can put on the bones, the better.

There isn’t a majority for that to take place”.A second Cabinet minister, Treasury chief secretary Liz Truss went on to insist the only choice is actually between the PM’s deal and no Brexit at all.Dubbing the moment as “a historic opportunity to leave the EU”, Ms Truss argued: “If my colleagues don’t sign up to this in Parliament, we’re in grave danger of not leaving at all”.But the PM stuck to her long-running line to tell the Commons that the alternative to her deal “will either be more uncertainty, more ision, or it could risk no Brexit at all”.Three Tory backbenchers thought to be loyal to Mrs May all spoke out to criticise the proposed deal - Neil Parish, Damian Collins and George Freeman.Slamming the deal’s controversial Irish backstop for threatening the UK’s integrity, Tiverton and Honiton MP Mr Parish told Mrs May: “I am a great supporter of yours and I accept what a dficult and tough job you have.“Please can I ask you to listen to these concerns and renegotiate the deal before you put it onto the floor of this House ”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn leaped on the government chaos to insist Mrs May’s deal was “dead”.But the PM hit back to repeat Mr Corbyn’s weekend gaffe back to him as she reminded MPs that he “hasn’t even read” the draft Brexit deal.Tory ministers have been told by No to expect the ‘meaningful vote’ on her deal to be held on December .Meanwhile Environment Secretary Michael Gove failed to give Eurosceptic MPs firm assurances that Britain will be free of EU quotas by January .Furious Brexiteers demanded he set a red line to ensure any extension of the transition period beyond December  will not apply to fishing.But Mr Gove wouldn’t give a final date for being outside the EU’s Commons Fisheries Policy - only saying Britain would become an “independent coastal state” after the transition period.He urged Eurosceptics: “We need to keep our eyes on the prize of making sure that after that transition period we can have all the opportunities to do the right thing environmentally, economically and socially.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There was an authoritative confidence about him as he picked at the Prime Minister’s Brexit scab in the House of Commons, exploiting the huge dficulties of a PM fighting on too many fronts. With Tory Remainers and Leavers both raising objections to her messy plan and the leader of Northern Ireland’s DUP, Nigel Dodds, nodding along to a Corbyn he’s supposed to hate, the danger’s real for meandering May. Because all of the objections raised by Corbyn - blank cheque costs, dficult trade deals and that Irish issue - all pack legitimacy.  May might even secretly agree with some of his points though, she’s never going to admit that publicly when she’s erasing previous red lines to try and sell as bad deal as better than no deal. She isn’t unintelligent so May will be only too aware that backing the best deal was two years ago voting to remain in the European Union. I suspect her Brextremist MPs won’t buy its her way or no way, May claiming the risk is Britain doesn’t leaveher concoction’s defeated in Parliament. Not so long ago she was pretending the UK risked crashing out with no deal unless her scam was approved. Corbyn still faces big questions about how Labour in Government could pull off a superior deal, and of course the issue of another referendum, but his enjoying himself is evidence of her struggle.

The annual event in Festival Place was meant to involve a parade of hundreds of school children, who had practiced a dance routine and song to perform to the crowds. But they were left disappointed at not being able to do their rehearsed routine, and parents have slammed the organisers for failing to instruct the children where to go and what to do, or guide them safely through the crowds. Parents described children left in tears at not being able to perform, and being pushed and shoved by the crowds.   One parent said her daughter who was asked to take part in the parade was actually abandoned in a side-room for an hour, leaving her panicked and crying. There was further disappointment when , wrist bands given out to the crowds, ten of which were meant to change colour to win pound vouchers, maled. The error resulted in Festival Place refusing to award any prizes, leaving numerous people, including children, disappointed when they believed they had won a prize. Those who attended took to social media to complain about the event. James Waine described the switch on as a shambles, adding: Would love to see their risk assessment for health and safety. Needs to be an investigation and report of the melee I have just witnessed.   Claire Boswell added: The organisers of this event let so many people down. Children were scared, crying and disappointed. I feel guilty now that my children had such an awful evening when it is the organisers who should be feeling this guilty. Carly Woodhams described it as the worst Christmas switch on ever adding: I dont think Ive ever seen so many children crying whilst watching lights being switched on. Kirsty Mason labelled the event as appalling, after her nine-year-old son was almost knocked over in the crowds, adding: Trying to get out was a nightmare, people were packed in so tightly you literally couldnt move. Mum Laura ONeill said her daughter was left panicked and crying having been asked to take part in the parade with her school friends, only to be abandoned for nearly an hour in a disused side room with no information about what was going on.   She added: It was confusing, scary and awful for them. Sara Gook said her six-year-old daughter believed she had won the wrist band competition, adding: She was all excited thinking she had won then after waiting ages just had her band taken off her and told no one had won due to a technical issue. Lauren Heidi Bridgeman had the same problem, thinking her daughter had won, and said: My eight-year-old was in floods of tears and was devastated. The event was also criticised for not being Christmassy enough, with an owl being lit up in the shopping centre rather than a Christmas tree, and the lights turned on by Snow White. Dani Natasha Dacey commented: Nothing Christmassy about it. Where the hell was Santa or a Christmas tree  Such a disappointment.   Kimberley Green accused the organisers of ruining the start of Christmas adding: No fireworks, no Santa, no organisation, no remorse, no safety. Absolute shambles of a light switch on. To make matters worse, shoppers said the roads around the centre were gridlocked following the event, as everyone tried to head home. A statement from Festival Place said: “This year’s Festival Place Christmas was planned to have a new focus with a parade event followed by six weeks of fun from the lights switch-on through to  December. “The Winter Woodland launch was incredibly well supported by the local community, but that did make the centre very busy and some planned elements of the parade couldn’t happen – safety is always a priority.   “We were most disappointed that the children of Hatch Warren Infant School didn’t get to perform the routine they had worked hard on, and are in touch with the headteacher to see how we can best make it up to them. “Unfortunately there was a technical fault with the wristbands which we couldn’t have foreseen and this meant we regrettably couldn’t launch the competition as planned. Following this we have donated all of the prize money to a local charity, St Michael’s Hospice, our nominated charity. “Festival Place is now decked out for the season, there’s a superb grotto for the little ones and lots more fun to come – we’re really looking forward to welcoming visitors to celebrate all that we have to offer this Christmas.” "},{"url":null,"title":"cruel note mums car said","story":"NewsCruel note on mums car said seriously ill daughter does not look disabledRachael Hanley, , of Rotherham in South Yorkshire was on a shopping trip with two-year-old Evie-Mae when she was confronted by the abusive womanShareCommentsByNathan Sandhu:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsRachael Hanley, , with two-year-old daughter Evie-Mae \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mother, whose young daughter has a serious breathing condition, discovered a cruel note left on her car after a family shopping trip. Rachael Hanley, , was devastated when she ed to the car park to find a handwritten letter from an angry female motorist saying her two-year-old does not look disabled. The note was attached to her windscreen despite an encounter two hours earlier with the shopper where she explained that her daughter was disabled when confronted. Rachael was accused of misusing a Blue Badge in Sheffield, South Yorkshire - and told she should bring a wheelchair for her daughter, Evie-Mae next time.To make matters worse, the tot unexpectedly began fitting and vomiting when they ed to the car and was left needing basic le support following a full body shaking seizure.Youngster Evie-Mae Pinkney, who was born on Valentines Day, has apnea of infancy - an unexplained episode of cessation of breathing for  seconds or longer. The disease means she has pauses in her breathing when she sleeps and the tot can need rapid access to oxygen.She also suffers from seizures - which trigger tiredness - that can be brought on spontaneously and without warning.Rachael had parked at Meadowhall, Sheffield with her two children during a shopping trip to buy Evie-Mae some new shoes and a hot chocolate when she was confronted by the abusive woman.The stay-at-home carer provided an explanation, before locking her car and leaving to go shopping, but ed to find the note tucked under the windscreen wiper.The note read : I have reported you for miss using a blue badge. Your daughter did not look or appear disabled. Hope your car is clamped. Next time bring a wheelchair.Rachael, from Rotherham, said: She said you cannot park there unless you are disabled, she got quite irate and aggressive. I locked the car and went into Meadowhall, we were gone for around two hours.Evie-Mae is quite forward and is aware of peoples feelings. She asked why was I crying, and why is that woman shouting at you .How do you explain to a two-year-old what is going on  When we got back to the car Evie-Mae had a full body shaking seizure, the only advice we have is to put her in the recovery position to make sure her airways are not blocked.After the seizure, I put her into her car seat and thats when I realised what was on the windscreen.The mother, who also has a -month-old son called Kye Pinkney, initially took to Facebook to vent her anger.Evie-Mae, who turns three in February, was diagnosed with apnea of infancy aged around six months but can often present as a child who is well. The tot has been given CPR, including chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth on six separate occasions.Evie-Mae on average suffers one seizure a week but her mum says they used to be daily.She has had a blue badge for over two years.The reason we have the blue badge is because we have to carry portable oxygen at all times and the equipment can be quite bulky, added Rachael. Especially when its a child that looks so healthy. She looks well until she suddenly starts having CPR.She can be having a great day and can end up in AE an hour later. She can become critical really quickly.Some disabilities arent always visible. Some people are old-fashioned and would expect Evie-Mae to be a wheelchairshe has a blue badge.Thats what upsets me the most, everything we have been through as a family having to save her le at times.When Evie-Mae was really young doctors said she wasnt going to make it and advised us to make plans for a funeral. So, to go through that as a family to then having a person saying dont park there is very upsetting. I could not believe someone could be so judgmental even after an explanation.Infant apnea is defined as an unexplained episode of cessation of breathing for  seconds or longer, or a shorter respiratory pause associated with bradycardia, cyanosis, pallor, and or marked hypotonia.Government guidelines state parents of children under three years old can apply for the badgethe child needs to be kept near a vehicle at all times with bulky medical equipment needed."},{"url":null,"title":"gay couple claim were kicked","story":"NewsGay couple claim they were kicked out of Wetherspoons for kissingThe men claim they were told to leave by a doorman at The Rodboro Buildings pub in Guildford, Surrey - but a Wetherspoons spokesman denied their claimShareCommentsBySimon Worthington:,  NOV NewsThe gay couple claim they were told to leave after kissing at the pub \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA gay couple claim they were left mortied after being kicked out of a Wetherspoons pub for kissing. The duo - who have asked not to be named - claim the incident happened at The Rodboro Buildings pub in Guildford, Surrey. They claim they were ordered to leave by a doorman as they were making their way out on Saturday night. A spokesman for the pub chain denied it was the kiss that got them thrown out - claiming they were asked to leave because of subsequent behaviour. One of the men, aged , said: Wed been out for a friends birthday, it was the end of the night and we were ready to leave.  Our two friends were waiting outside for us. We were on our way down the stairs when we stopped and had a kiss. There was nobody around. My partner would never have kissed methere was, he doesnt like public displays of affection. Speaking to the Morning Advertiser pub trade website, the man added: Then suddenly there was a shout from the bottom of the stairs from one of the door staff saying Oi you two, out. When asked why they were told to leave, the staff member allegedly said because of that on the stairs. The man then said he asked: Youre kicking us out because I kissed my boyfriend   He just replied Out so I asked him again but he refused to reply. Writing on Twitter, one of the mens friends said: Some friends of minegot thrown out of @Wetherspoon_UK Guildford merely for kissing each other. Seems they like to serve hate and homophobia with the friendly beer. Eddie Gershon, a spokesman for JD Wetherspoon, said: The men kissed at the top of the stairs, which is not an issue. However, they were asked to leave the pub because of their behaviour after that. I would stress thata man wants to kiss a man or a woman kiss a woman - or any other combination - it is absolutely fine to do so in a Wetherspoon pub. But this couple were not asked to leave for kissing each other.

It was revealed this week that Meghan is up at am and works hard all day on projects shes passionate about. And now it has emerged that she spends days preparing her speeches and insists on writing them herself. The Duchess of Sussex made two speeches during her and Prince Harrys royal tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.  In ABC News special Meghan’s New Le: The Real Princess Diaries, which airs tomorrow, royal experts discuss how Meghan penned her own speeches for her first tour. The networks royal editor, Omid Scobie, noticed she was carrying notes with handwritten scribbles all over them. Omid said: I asked a palace aide, has she written this herself , as thats quite unusual for the royals, theres usually other people. This was all her, shes been up for days working on this speech. Penning speeches herself isnt Meghans only unusual move - her content is also a step away from the norm with a focus on womens empowerment and feminism.  Vanity Fairs Michelle Ruiz says in the documentary: In these times and for this family it is pushing the envelope to give speeches on feminism. Its certainly something the Queen doesnt do, nor does Kate Middleton do. Meghan is the feminist princess of our dreams. During the tour, Meghan, , gave a speech at the University of South Pacic in Suva. She told the students about she worked on campus at Northwestern University and said every penny went directly towards my tuition. Meghan also detailed the importance of education in empowering women.  She said: Everyone should be afforded the opportunity to receive the education they want, but more importantly the education they have the right to receive. And for women and girls in developing countries, this is vital. Providing them with access to education is the key to economic and social development. Because when girls are given the right tools to succeed, they can create incredible futures, not only for themselves but also for those around them. This was Meghans second speech after speaking at the launch of the charity cookbook, Together: Our Community Cookbook. Meghan also spoke at Government House in Wellington to mark theth anniversary of womens suffrage in New Zealand.  She said: Womens suffrage is not simply about the right to vote for women but also about what that represents. The basic and fundamental human right of all people - including members of society who have been marginalised - whether for reasons of race, gender, ethnicity or orientation - to be able to participate in the choices for their future and their community.

Harri Cooke, from Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, was a happy and healthy tot before his mum, Carly, , noticed he had a weeping eye last September. After initially believing her son had a common cold that had caused conjunctivitis, it wasnt until Harris face began to swell that further tests were conducted and a deadly cancerous mass was discovered behind his nose. In January this year, Harri was diagnosed with Ewings Sarcoma - a rare type of bone cancer - and has since needed gruelling rounds of chemotherapy in a bid to shrink the tumour in his face as well as pioneering US treatment.   Harri is now in remission after nine months of treatment and his mum, Carly, is sharing their story to raise awareness. Carly, a self-employed massage therapist, said: Harri often had colds so at first I didnt think much of his weeping eye. The doctors agreed that it was likely to be a cold but as the weeks passed he was believed to have a blocked tear duct. It didnt seem to bother him, he was so happy all of the time. But when his face began to swell we were referred from our GP to an eye specialist. Once we arrived six doctors turned up, and they all seemed really worried. The NHS did everything they could but we just didnt realise how serious it was. Harris bone structure around his eye had changed, indicating the malicious mass that lay behind.   His type was so rare - we were in complete shock. You never think its going to be your child. It was six days later after Harris diagnosis that he started chemotherapy on February  this year. Carly, and husband James Cooke, , who works as mechanic, found themselves having to focus entirely on Harris treatment. His cancer would require treatment available only in America, as well as other NHS treatments. In order to give Harri the best possible odds, his cancer requires treatment with proton beam therapy - a type of radiotherapy that uses protons as opposed to x-rays. Carly added: I have another younger son called Josh, who is now  months, but we had to focus on Harri.  Family friends managed to raise us pound, for him to receive in order for him to receive proton beam therapy. The NHS fund the treatment and main expenses, but we couldnt have afforded for James to take  weeks off work. And despite everything he was still smiling, it was so hard watching him go through it, it was like torture. Harri endured  treatments in Florida, US - which continued every day under general anaesthetic for six weeks - combined with  rounds of chemotherapy. Thankfully it was all worthwhile and the youngster is now in remission but his parents now worry how his treatment will affect him in the long run. Carly said: I believe that only one percent of fundraising from big cancer charities goes specically to childrens cancer. The medication is so much harsher to children.   Harris treatments means that he could have growth issues, teeth problems and is more likely to have cancer later in le. Hes had to have over  blood transfusions to try and save his le. Carly is urging other parents to recognise the signs, however small, of this deadly illness, and help raise awareness of how a child can be affected. Carly said, Its so rare and unexpected that its hard to know what to look for. Blood supplies are currently depleted, and donors are needed for both blood and platelet transfusions. Charities like CLIC Sargent, a charity for children with cancer, are brilliant for helping families and informing them.

Sarah McGuiness gave birth to her son Max Williams at just  weeks after going into early labour. Despite medics best efforts to slow down the pregnancy, Max was born breathing, but weighed just lb and oz. Sarah, from Llanwit Major in South Wales, said she lived in constant fear her fragile son wouldnt survive - and one night was terried she had lost him forever. While staying at the University Hospital of Wales, Sarah had been getting some sleep on the ward while her partner Chris sat at Maxs incubator in the intensive care baby unit. After checking her phone one last time before going to sleep, she saw the words RUN pop up on the screen in a text from Chris, reports Wales Online. Max had stopped breathing after something became trapped in his airways. Despite being revived, he stopped breathing three more times that night before one one occasion all alarms were set off and a crash team came in to work on him. Sarah and Chris watched on in disbelief as the team worked to save their newborn sons le.  Describing the horric moment they thought theyd lose Max, Sarah said: I’ve never moved as quickly as I did that night. “It usually takes a while to get buzzed through the doors of the women’s unit, but someone must have seen how I was running because they opened straight away. “When I arrived, there was a team working on Max. Something had got stuck in his airway and he’d stopped breathing. “They managed to revive him but it happened three more times, once when I was holding him and he just turned blue in my hands. “Suddenly all the alarms were going off and the crash team rushed in. We were left standing in the corner of the room feeling a terror that’s hard to describe. “I don’t think that memory of being on the brink of losing everything but being unable to change any of it will ever leave us. Sarah had been having a normal pregnancy up until the morning of her -week scan, when she realised she was bleeding. A midwe referred her straight to the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend where tests revealed she was in early labour. She was given injections to try and slow down labour, medication to help mature the baby’s brain and lungs and was told she might deliver before the end of the day.   In the space of just a few short hours, Sarah and partner Chris Williams lives changed forever. Sarah said: “I started shaking uncontrollably at that point, out of shock I think more than anything. “And it was then that the midwe whispered words in to my ear that I think helped to save all three of us in the days that were to come. “She hugged me really tight and told me that I couldn’t cry now. She said that my stress and adrenaline could speed up labour and my job was to stay as calm as possible. “In a situation that was suddenly and very dramatically out of our control, it gave me a focus.” The pair were rushed to the University Hospital of Wales where they were prepared for the imminent birth of their baby. But the medication to slow the labour seemed to work, giving them hope that the pregnancy might progress for another few weeks at least. The following morning, Sarah woke up in a pool of blood and was convinced that she’d lost the baby. An examination revealed that she was cm dilated. The baby was still alive but she was now in full labour. Sarah added: “From then on we were on one major countdown. We knew that every minute the baby stayed inside would help so we celebrated each hour that passed. “But the pain got worse as the days progressed, and we knew that there was no stopping the inevitable.   “I was told to push when I was ready and I remember Chis saying ‘whatever happens next, our baby is about to be born’. In that moment we felt so happy.” Baby Max was born tiny but breathing, although it took some time for the neonatal team to get all the necessary tubes into him. Chris and Sarah said they couldn’t see Max from where they sitting, so they avidly watched everyone’s expressions for signs that he was okay. Eventually, and to their complete surprise, they were given the opportunity to hold their new son. Sarah said in those few seconds they felt immense pride and a confidence that Max would survive. For the first few weeks, Sarah and Chris quickly learnt to adapt to the routine of le on the neonatal ward with their new son. For  precious seconds twice a day, the new parents took it in turns to hold him through the incubator windows while his sheets were being changed. They celebrated each tiny bit of progress and laughed at how he would suck avidly at the cotton bud dipped in Sarah’s milk, which they used to keep his mouth clean and moist.   But at around the two-week mark things began to change - and Max began to struggle with his breathing on the night Sarah received the dreaded text. With Max’s condition continuing to deteriorate, a decision was made to start him on a course of steroids. It was the only option left open, but given the very long and frightening list of potential side-effects – including partial but permanent paralysis – it was a very frightening thing for Chris and Sarah to consent to. Max was paralysed and sedated and placed on an oscillator breathing machine to keep his lungs permanently inflated while the medication took effect. Sarah and Chris were painfully aware that the longer he was dependent on the machinery to breathe for him, the worse his chances for a normal le were going to be. Thankfully the steroids did their job and, very slowly, Max’s condition started to improve. Each day, the consultants would make the smallest adjustment, trying to work out the best course of action for Max. Sarah added: “Each baby and each situation is very dferent and there are so many components in the care of a neonatal baby.   “I have so much respect for the medical team who painstakingly and meticulously took the tiniest of calculated risks every day to work out what was best for Max. “That takes real bravery and determination.” Eventually, Max was well enough to come off the ventilator and be moved out of intensive care on to the high dependency unit . But even though the family were one step closer to home, some of their darkest days were yet to come. Shortly after moving on to HDU Max was diagnosed with stage  retinopathy of prematurity , an eye condition that can cause blindness in premature babies. Sarah and Chris were told that to be in with a chance of saving Max’s sight, he would need laser eye surgery under anaesthetic. This would mean ato the ventilator and the intensive care unit. Sarah said: “The thought of going back to the place that filled us with such dficult memories terried us, but the fear I felt at the prospect of Max being blind just grabbed hold of me and wouldn’t let go. “Through the whole journey I’d comforted myself by daydreaming about all the tiny normal things we could do together in the future, like walking down the street jumping in puddles. “Now even that seemed like it was being taken away.” Still a full month away from his official due date, Max was taken to theatre for surgery. He spent two days on the ventilator before ing to HDU. Then came the wait to find out whether the surgery had been a success.   During this time Max was also having dficulty learning to swallow and would often choke and stop breathing for periods of time. Eventually, despite his setbacks, Max was finally well enough to go home – a week after his official due date – and his parents received the news that his eye surgery had been a success. Max required home oxygen and some feeding support for a few months after “graduating” from the hospital.

What she hadn’t expected was the sadness at having to say goodbye to the neonatal team. “We developed such a strong bond with so many special nurses and consultants who’d cared for Max that it was dficult to leave them behind,” she said. “They’d got us through the hardest possible of times by showing care, compassion and even humour at times. “We’ll never forget these nurses and all the staff.

Bopper - nicknamed Bopper the Whopper - was taken in by the RSPCA when his owners became too unwell to look after him. Now the poor pooch finds breathing and standing dficult because of his huge size. He tips the scales at .kg when he should weigh around kg. Gables Farm Dogs and Cats Home, in Plymouth, took Bopper in from the RSPCA but say he is too large to fit in any of their kennels. So he is currently living with deputy manager Ruth Rickard. He isnt the only overweight dog the rescue home has looked after.   Earlier this year they managed to slim down a dog called Hattie, a collie cross, who weighed kg. Ruth says: Just when I thought Hattie the Fattie was the fattest dog we had seen here at Gables in comes Bopper who makes her look tiny! He weighs much more than Hattie did and is a lot older so he will need our help to achieve what Hattie has so he can start to feel better and more mobile. Boppers extreme weight means he is at a very high risk of developing diabetes and will have to have his blood taken regularly to monitor his sugar levels.   He has now been put on a special diet complete with gentle exercise to reduce his size - with the total cost of his treatment and weight loss plan totting up to around pound. The animal home is trying to raise money to help pay for Boppers care.It comes as half of British dogs are now classied as overweight or obese, according to research by dog well-being app PoochPlay. It found that out of , dogs analysed .% were recorded as overweight. The research also found that a portion of canines in the UK lacked an active lestyle.  Nearly half of app users stated that their dog was an indoor pet, while % were recorded as either lazy or sedentary. This is in comparison to % of dogs who were recorded as active. Obesity in dogs can lead to serious health issues, including diabetes, joint and bone disorder and cardiovascular problems – shortening their lespan by up to two years. Research has shown that % of owners do not know the level of exercise their pet requires, fuelling the pet obesity crisis in Britain and beyond. Dferent breeds of dogs naturally require dferent amount of activity, with dogs such as Labradors needing the same amount as a human, whereas smaller dogs, such as chihuahuas, only need  minutes a day.  The research aimed to explore areas of dog health and safety, including the weight of the pet and the level of exercise they regularly receive. Ravi Sharma, CEO and founder of PoochPlay, said: “We want to tackle dog obesity one dog at a time, and hope to educate society on the correct amount of food and exercise their furry friends should be having.

Every responsible vet, as well as the Government, says you should always see a puppy with its mother before purchase, so that you can check its breeding conditions. So, posing as a potential buyer, I emailed Tfany Chihuahuas asking to see Simba and her mum. That, it turned out, would not be possible – the mother was hundreds of miles away. “She is an import from a reputable partner breeder so both parents are not here to be seen,” came the reply. “However I do have their photos.”   That explains why pictures of the same puppy, and many more besides, can be found on the Facebook pages of Tfany Chihuahuas and a breeder in Russia. Tfany Chihuahuas is run by Elena Katerova, who upset viewers in August when she appeared with “teacup” dogs on Good Morning Britain and some appeared to be distressed by the experience in the studio. “One of the little dogs was literally shaking, that suggests it isnt very happy or strong,” tweeted one viewer. They’re terried! posted another. I asked her why she didn’t state on her Facebook page or website that the dogs were imported from Russia. “I do say that when people get in contact with me, but at the end of the day it’s business, I don’t want my competition to know what I’m doing,” she replied. She insisted “I work with reputable breeders abroad because they’ve got the best quality dogs,” and said there was nothing wrong with importing the dogs, which are taken to Moscow and then flown to Britain via Amsterdam. “They travel with a courier on a plane, they come through legally,” she says.   “If you’ve got the right shytransport,you meet all the rules, there’s nothing unethical. They are the right age, they travel fully vaccinated, I’ve got all the right paperwork.” But how can potential buyers follow the official advice to see puppies with their mothersthey’re in Russia  Elena said she can provide videos, or buyers can travel to Russia – which does not seem very practical. Earlier this year, Elena was in court after a customer shydiscovered that the Pomeranian called Bella that she’d bought had a metal splint in one leg. “Six weeks after the operation the seller sold the dog to me for pound, and claimed the dog to be a perfect example of the breed,” posted Jane Martin on shyTrustpilot. She was refunded through her bank but then refused tothe puppy, saying: “I made it clear I was willing to pay an appropriate price but this was declined.”  Elena admitted that the puppy had broken a leg but said it had recovered and accused Ms Martin of trying to get it cheaply. She sued and Ms Martin was ordered to pay her pound,. In a counterclaim, Elena Katerova was ordered to pay pound to Ms Martin. The Mirror’s Lucy’s Law campaign led by campaigning vet Marc Abraham of PupAid will ban the sale of puppies by anyone apart from the breeders themselves. Environment minister Michael Gove has pledged to back the campaign, aimed at stamping out puppy farmers. Elena said: “Lucy’s Law is not in place at the moment.” It’s only a matter of time.  In other puppy dealing news, one of Britains biggest puppy farms has been raided by the police and RSPCA. A total of  dogs were taken from Little Rascals of Brant Broughton, Lincs, last week. A spokesman for the RSPCA said: “As an investigation is ongoing, we cannot go into any further detail at this time.” Little Rascals Pets Limited was put into compulsory liquidation by HM Revenue and Customs over unpaid tax earlier this month, and it has four outstanding county court judgments totalling more than pound,. It was licenced for  breeding bitches but the licence expired on  October. Former director Edward Swindells said the family business would continue, saying that around  dogs remain on the site. “I will respond to you when the RSPCA respond to me,” he said. “We have not received any information from them as yet, we have not received any allegations or requests for interviews.”  Meanwhile, around  dogs and puppies have been rescued in County Durham. Search warrants were executed under the Animal Welfare Act on buildings in Bishop Auckland where a suspected puppy farm was discovered. Police officers reported that some of the animals were badly injured. “With Christmas around the corner, we encourage people to buy puppies from a reputable breeder,” said Inspector Andy Reeves, of Bishop Auckland Neighbourhood Police Team. “Make sure you see the puppy with its mother, all the paperwork is in order and injections are up to date.” Or, better still,you want a dog then visit your local rescue centre, where you could find your new best friend - and you wont be helping puppy farmers.

Study Of A Head Of A Young Man, measuring just in high, is expected to fetch about poundmillion when it is auctioned in London next month. Buried in the original layer of paint, in the lower edge of the “powerful and touching” th century portrait, experts found what are believed to be the Dutch master’s thumbprints. No other prints by the painter, said to be the “foremost master of the Western artistic tradition”, have ever been found. While it is impossible to confirm the prints are those of Rembrandt, who is famous for his portraits and use of light and shadow, experts believe they are the “only known fingerprints of the Dutch master”. They were uncovered during a process of technical examination and restoration, which included pigment analyses, X-ray and infra-red imaging, just before the painting went on display in the US and the Louvre, in Paris. George Gordon, worldwide co-chairman of Sotheby’s Old Master paintings, who are auctioning the work, called the find an “extraordinary discovery”.   “You often get finger and thumbprints in the nish of painting, but that doesn’t really tell you anything of interest,” he said. “This is in the original paint. “This shows that Rembrandt was happy with the painting while it was still wet. He painted it very quickly. “But what is certain is that it is somebody that picked up the painting as soon as it was finished.” He added: “While as far as we know no comparable finger or thumbprints of Rembrandt have been found in other works to confirm the conclusion, the discovery of the marks in the original layer of paint.... make their connection to the artist highly credible.” He said that the portrait, dating from around , has a “spiritual and emotional impact”. “We know he worked really quickly and you can also see and feel it in this painting,” he said. “When Rembrandt applies thick layers of paint, some of the colour leaches through. It has an intense visceral quality and is astonishingly well preserved.” He added: “I suspect people will now look for fingerprints in other paintings.” Michel van de Laar, a conservator in Amsterdam who helped lead the research, said: “The work was also determined to have been executed in one sitting. “The discovery of the fingerprints is further testament to the speed with which the work was likely executed and provides fresh insight into Rembrandt’s complex but swt painting technique.” Study Of A Head Of A Young Man portrays Rembrandt’s model as Jesus, with his hands clasped in prayer, and has been praised for the artist’s ability to “render human emotions”.

Keith Williams spent  years grafting in his adoptive father’s coal business in South Wales before deciding to trace his biological roots. And the -year-old could never have imagined the astonishing discovery he was to make. The humble Carmarthenshire man known as Keith y Glowas the illegitimate firstborn son of the rd Sultan of Perak in Malaysia. He flew out to try to meet his new family but claims that following initial contact he was given the cold shoulder. And while stressing he has no interest in vying for the throne, he is now shydetermined to claim any inheritance his royal father may have left him.  Keith said: “It is a shame they have decided to close ranks on me. I understandthey feel threatened but it’s not like I am claiming the throne. I am sure my father knew about me andhe did I am sure he would have left something behind for me and I think it is only right I know about it.” When Keith learned of his origins, it was too late to make contact with his father, Idris Iskandar Al-Mutawakkil Alallahi Shah, as he died in . Keith’s mum, Elizabeth Rosa, was  and a trainee nurse at a children’s hospital in Carshalton, Surrey, when she met the royal while he was studying in the UK. They had a whirlwind affair and she became pregnant.  Elizabeth was forced to go home to Swansea and give up Keith for adoption, and the prince was sent back to Malaysia to avoid a scandal. After his , he served as the state’s rd Sultan of Perak from  until his death. Malaysia has nine Sultanates and the families live opulent lestyles in palaces. It is unclear what Keith’s family are worth but business magazine Forbes has revealed the current Sultan’s daughter, Eleena Azlan Shah, was worth poundmillion in . However, Keith, of Penygroes, stresses his move is not about greed. He said: “Of course they are worth a considerable amount. I am not interested in their money, I just want to knowmy father may have left me anything.  “If it was confirmed that there was some sort of inheritance, why wouldn’t I be interested  It is something he would have wanted me to have, isn’t it  “My father was known as the ‘People’s Sultan’ – everybody liked him, from what I have researched. I am sure he would want the best for me.” Keith says evenhe was left nothing, it would still mean the world to him for the family to simply pick up the phone. During a visit to Malshyshyaysia, he met half-sister Ku Ess and visited his father’s tomb. After the current sultan Nazrin Shah dies, the next will be Keith’s younger half-brother. He revealed he had a DNA test showing Asian ancestry and he has inquired about Malaysian citizenship but heard nothing back.  Keith said: “To be honshyshyest, I find it sad and a little annoying they are ignoring me. At one point we were in touch all the time and they even agreed to a DNA test. But now they cannot evenan email. “It is sad. I just want to get to know them and learn about my father. I am convinced he knew about me. When my mum got pregnant and went into care and came back to South Wales, she wrote letters to him. In one, he gave her a photo of the palace with the phone number and address on the back.

John Allen Chau was shot dead with arrows after travelling to North Sentinel Island, home to the last pre-Neolithic tribe in the world and out of bounds to visitors, on November . The -year-old bribed fishermen to ferry him there but as soon as he reached the beach, the hostile tribe shot at him with bows and arrows before dragging him onto the sand. North Sentinel Island is one of the islands in Indias remote Andaman and Nicobar chain.  His Instagram and Facebook profiles show pictures of him travelling to far-flung places across the globe. In his last post on November , he shared pictures of the jungle and one of a leech between his toes and wrote: Adventure awaits. So do leeches. It emerged yesterday that Chau had written notes describing how members of the tribe were good to him while others were very aggressive. I have been so nice to them. Why are they so angry and so aggressive  a source quoted Chau as saying. Chau wrote that he was doing this to establish the kingdom of Jesus on the island... Do not blame the nativesI am killed. In a statement on Instagram, Chaus family said: We recently learned from an unconfirmed report that John Allen Chau was reported killed in India while reaching out to members of the Sentinelese Tribe in the Andaman Islands.  The family described him as a beloved son, brother and uncle as well as a Christian missionary, wilderness emergency medical technician, soccer coach and mountaineer. He loved God, le, helping those in need and had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people, the family said. We forgive those reportedly responsible for his death. We also ask for the release of those friends he had in the Andaman Islands. The family asked that local contacts not be prosecuted in the case. The Sentinelese tribe are hunter-gatherers who are completely isolated from the outside world. The International Christian Concern said Chau was a Christian missionary who wanted to make contact with the tribe. William Stark, ICCs regional manager, paid tribute to Chau and condemned his killing.  He said: We here at International Christian Concern are extremely concerned by the reports of an American missionary being murdered in Indias Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Our thoughts and prayers go out to both Johns family and friends. A full investigation must be launched in this this murder and those responsible must be brought to justice. India must take steps to counter the growing wave of intolerance and violence. Jatin Narwal, Superintendent of Police at Port Blair, told TNM that John was last seen alive on November . He added: He lived in Alabama, US. He is some kind of paramedic. He was on a misplaced adventure in prohibited area to meet uncontacted persons.  People thought he is a missionary because he had mentioned his position on god and that he was a believer on social media or somewhere online. But in a strict sense, he was not a missionary. He was an adventurer. His intention was to meet the aborigines. A source told AFP: He tried to reach the Sentinel island on November  but could not make it. Two days later he went well prepared. He left the dinghy midway and took a canoe all by himself to the island. He was attacked by arrows but he continued walking. The fishermen saw the tribals tying a rope around his neck and dragging his body.  “They were scared and fled but ed next morning to find his body on the sea shore.” When they got back to Port Blair, they told a local preacher, who was a friend of Chaus, what had happened. A murder case has been registered, one of the officials told Reuters. Deepak Yadav, a police official in the island chain in the Bay of Bengal, said police have launched an investigation. We are aware of reports concerning a U.S. citizen in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a spokeswoman for the United States consulate in Indias southern city of Chennai said in an email.  When a U.S. citizen is missing, we work closely with local authorities as they carry out their search efforts, she added, but declined to provide further details over privacy concerns. One of the police sources said Chau, who had made previous visits to the islands, had a strong desire to meet the Sentinelese. He reportedly made a failed attempt to get to the island on November .

He had been cycling to work in Strand, close to Cape Town, when he was attacked by two men - one of who stabbed him in the head. The kne with a six-inch blade was stuck hard into his head as the pair tried to grab his bike but incredibly Shaun fought back and managed to beat them both off. Amazingly he then got back on his bike and cycled half a mile with the kne sticking out of the side of his skull to the surgery of his local GP Dr Brendan Venter, . Dr Venter – a former Springbok rugby player and a rugby coach – said: “One of our female doctors was on duty and she was called to a patient with a kne wound.  “To say it was dramatic to see him with a kne sticking out of the side of his head was an understatement but he was very calm and lucid although bleeding a lot. He asked very politelywe had a doctor free to see him. “The doctor decided that rather than wait for an ambulance she would drive him to hospital in her car herself and he askedit was ok to leave his bike with us. “The patient was very lucky in that although the kne was plunged into his skull it bent on impact with the bone and the blade went down his face outside the skull. “He was very very lucky that the blade hit him in the wrong spot to kill him.  “He fought for his bike back and rode to us as he knew where we were and we are his GP and when he got here he just walked in and calmly asked for help. “This is not something that happens every day and it seems it is a violent gang who have struck viciously a few times in the last few weeks and they will be caught. “It was not even an expensive bike and is one he cycles on to and from work each day. Why they used the level of violence they did is just beyond me” he said. Shaun is the popular manager of Soo She restaurant which is a local sushi and Asian eating place on the Strand and he cycles to and from work every day. He was rushed into the Tygerberg Hospital nearby on Monday afternoon and underwent emergency surgery and a spokesman confirmed he was “stable”. Doctors told his mother he was expected to make a full recovery. Friend Carl Block said on Facebook: “I was with him in the doctors. He rode himself there was was so calm and polite to the doctors saying: “Can a doctor please help ” “This guy is an amazing person and I have known him for five years and was in tears last night and couldn’t sleep. I am asking you to all please pray for Shaun”. The photographs have gone viral on social media with one showing Shaun stood bleeding in the doctors surgery and a second of an x-ray of the kne in his head. The South African Police Service confirmed they are investigating the attack. Former South African cycling champion Wimpie van der Merwe, , said he was attacked whilst with his cycling partner in exactly the same place a week before. The former world champ said Elize Jansen van Rensburg, , probably fell victim to the same gang who pushed her off her bike breaking her hip, pelvis and coccyx. He stormed: “Police do your work.

The destruction of the pillboxes on the heavily fortied border came after an agreement with South Korea to completely destroy such locations in the region. Footage provided by South Koreas defence ministry showed guard posts in North Korea destroyed up in thick smoke. They appear to have been packed with explosives that were detonated remotely. The explosions sent fragments of rock and fire into the air as the heavily entrenched fortications were destroyed. It follows a military pact at a summit last month in North Korea that called for a halt to all hostile acts, a no-fly zone near the border and the gradual removal of guard posts, firearms and landmines from the DMZ separating the two.  As an initial step, the neighbors agreed to demolish  guard posts within . miles of each side of the border and withdraw equipment and personnel stationed there by the end of November, the ministry said.

It was seen from the port city of Salerno and many locals recorded the action, and took photos of the phenomenon. The water tornado appeared on Tuesday afternoon skirting ports and reportedly damaging containers as it finally crossed the shoreline. Waterspouts are similar to tornadoes, but form when cool unstable air passes over warmer waters, producing vigorous updraughts that can turn into a spinning column of water. They generally collapse once they move across solid ground.  The Salerno Today said that the spout damaged some containers near the waterfront, but no injuries had been reported.

managers operating in the Championship right now who know better than Robbie Neilson just how powerful fans can be.As a player, he played more than two thirds of his  plus games for Hearts, whose supporters, arguably, create the best atmosphere of any club outside of the Old Firm when their team is playing in front of them at Tynecastle.And Robbie, of course, experienced more of what the Jambos fans have to offer when he successfully managed them for two-and-a-half years.Those spells in Edinburgh, in particular, taught him the backing of a passionate support can be worth points to a team.And he believes that can prove the case now he’s in charge at Dundee United.Since taking over from Csaba Laszlo at Tannadice last month, Robbie has mentioned the quality of the backing Arabs have given his rejuvenated team on several occasions.And he firmly believes they’ve more than played their part in an impressive unbeaten run of four wins and a draw that has seen the Tangerines re-emerge as serious promotion contenders from the second tier.On Tuesday night, however, it could be a case of ided loyalties for some Arabs, simply because United will be facing Alloa in a re-arranged league outing at the same time as Scotland face what could be a vital Nations League clash with Israel at Hampden.Having been blown away by the backing so far, the manager suspects it will be a case of club before country for most.“I’m definitely looking for a big turnout,” he said.“If there are any more pull-outs, my problem could be a few players might get called up for the Scotland squad!”Jokes aside, he does believe most Arabs will be in their usual seats at Tannadice and providing the kind of backing that’s become the envy of the rest of the second tier.“You have that Scotland game but the fans have been brilliant since I came in,” he said.“We took nearly , fans up to Ross County last weekend and we took , to Dunfermline the other week as well.“We’ve had great backing at home as well and, hopefully, they will turn up in numbers.“I understand midweek football means it’s always dficult for fans to make the journey.“We hope we can prove to them thatthey come along we’ll try to entertain and try to get a result.”As good as the backing so far has been, the manager does stress it remains down to his team to always make sure the supporters in the stands are given something to shout about.“The fans can make a massive dference but the initial stage will come from the players because the players, in the first  minutes of the game, have to set the tone,” he said.“They have to set the intensity and they have to get the fans off their seats.“If we can do that it reciprocates from the fans and we start putting pressure on teams and that’s what we need.”And that experience of playing with Hearts tells himthe support is on top form, at times it can mean points are picked up before a ball is even kicked.“I’ve played in venues where teams have come and you knew, because of the atmosphere and intensity, the game was done in the warm-up,” he said.“You knew you were going to win the game because the opposition couldn’t handle the atmosphere.“We need the supporters to try to give us that and we know they can.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/Howff-Cemetery-in-Meadowside-this-afternoon.jpg ","title":"its 1 30pm and dundee

Ness Bank and Cavell Gardens ndash on the opposite side of the river ndash is also included in the proposed mph zone.The zone includes a road near the park where motorist John Macdonald knocked down a four-year-old boy and drove off leaving the youngster seriously injured in July last year. Macdonald was later jailed for four months, banned from driving for a year and fined pound.Statistics show several other accidents took place between January  and July  in the planned mph zone.Regional MSP and long-time road safety campaigner David Stewart said winning public support is vital for the project.ldquoWith such issues, I am always of the mind that key stakeholders and those directly affected should always be fully consulted on such matters and consideration given to any concerns raised before a final plan is put forward for approval, he said.ldquoI have in the past been an advocate for wider footpaths to better accommodate cyclists and pedestrians and I have also suggested that the surfaces be painted a set colour to inform those utilising them of their primary use.He added: ldquoWith regards to the mph speed restriction proposed for the Bught Park area, this makes total sense to me since this area is well utilised for sporting and recreational purposes by many people and will make the surrounding roads safer for all.Thursday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118428.jpg","title":"Search continues for top young photographers","story":"THE deadline to find the arearsquos best young photographers has been extended until the end of the year.The Inverness Courier and Inverness Camera Club ndash which are both celebrating milestone anniversaries ndash have joined forces to launch a photographic competition.Aimed at eight to -year-olds, entrants are asked to submit an image depicting the theme, Inverness Past and Present.The winners will have their work published in the Courier and receive a voucher and framed print of their entry.The competition marks the th anniversary of the Courier while the camera club is celebrating its th anniversary.As part of its celebrations, the club is displaying membersrsquo past images at Eden Court Theatre in Inverness.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move.

Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13594714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_ayr-u.jpg","title":"ayr united appear itv show","story":"NewsAyr United appear on ITV show The Chase as Bradley Walsh asks questionsThe Honest Men appeared as an answer on hit ITV show The Chase yesterday .Share.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByLochlin Highet:,  NOV NewsThe Chasers \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have been flying high at the top of the Championship - and now theyve made prime time national TV.

Five primary schools in the area were ordered to raise standards by Education Scotland inspectors. They include Catrine, Logan and Drongan and Kilmarnock schools Hillhead and Mount Carmel. Four of the schools: Drongan, Logan, Catrine and Mount Carmel have seen head teacher changes since the inspections took place. Hillhead got a new school boss shortly before the Education Scotland visit. The recently recruited heads appeared before a council meeting to report on progress this week. Commenting on the shake-up of leadership in the schools, Councillor George Mair said it “seems to be head teachers disappear”. And he asked: “Is there an island they are all on ” Speaking at the council’s Governance and Scrutiny Committee last week he said the new head teachers appeared to be doing a good job. But he added: “What has been going on before  What is the problem with head teachers ”  Committee chairman Councillor Barry Douglas said: “We are not here to discuss inidual head teachers.” The council’s chief governance officer David Mitchell said there is a link between the strength and quality of leadership in schools and reports received. The meeting heard about the status at each school with the new heads giving updates to councillors. Catrine Primary and Early Childhood Centre was ordered to carry out a list of ‘requirements,’ ‘improvements’ and ‘recommendations’ in . A new head teacher, Judith Govans who was previously depute in Hurlford, was recruited to the post in June, . Ms Govans told the Committee: “To get Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Educationin was very exciting. I have had a lot of support from the local authority and my colleagues, which is appreciated.” A report presented to the meeting said: “An experienced head teacher within the local authority was re-deployed within the school.  Progress at the school is now rated satisfactory and good at the nursery. Another update on the primary from the council is due at a later date. Sean Maddocks has just become acting head of Drongan Primary and nursery. Both the school and nursery received two weak and satisfactory scores in May from Education Scotland. Mr Maddocks said: “Following the inspection in May we have a clear action plan.” A further inspection of Drongan will take place at a later date Logan Primary and Early Childhood Centre has made good progress since it was given a list of improvements from Education Scotland in . Head teacher Denise MacColl was appointed in  after the inspection. The meeting heard how she managed to turn around the school’s fortune quickly and there will be no more visits from inspectors. Councillor Sally Cogley, of the Rubbish Party told her: “Well done.” "},{"url":null,"title":"borders-binmen-miss-more-than-2000-collections-each-year","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council chiefs have been forced to admit they miss more than , bin collections each year.Figures released through a freedom of information request show that over the last five years, council bin crews have failed to empty more than , bins from around , households.Furthermore, the number of bins missed each year has been rising since , when , bins collections were missed.Three years later, in , that number had risen to ,, and already this year , bins have been missed.Opposition councillors have lined up to criticise the figures, particularly in the wake of allegations that Scottish Borders Council is considering moving to three-weekly bin collections when the budget is proposed in February of next year.Hawick and Denholm councillor Clair Ramage said: ldquoBin collection is a very emotive subject and as councillors we receive many complaints over this very issue.ldquoTo see that there has been a rise in the number of missed bin collections is extremely alarming and has to be investigated as a matter of urgency but this is only the tip of the iceberg.ldquoIn the last month we have been informed that Scottish Borders Council is considering tri-weekly uplts, a change that I am completely opposed to.ldquoAt the moment Scottish Borders Council is struggling as we have seen householders use their recycling bins for general waste when their general waste bins are full.ldquoThis creates other problems, the recycling vehicles are then contaminated with general waste and have to pay penalties to the processing company.ldquoIf bi-weekly lts are not working then tri weekly lts will create even more problems, for example fly tipping.ldquoI realise that budgets are tight but the combination of missed bin collections resulting in rubbish spilling over encouraging vermin is not something that as a community we should accept.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer also commented: \"I do not recall missed bin collections being a statistic that is regularly shared with councillors. Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the Borders.ldquoHouseholders reporting a missed collection over this period will have contributed signicantly to the increase this year."},{"url":null,"title":"a72-to-close-at-clovenfords-while-manhole-cover-is-repaired","story":"DRIVERS in the Tweed Valley are being warned the A will be closed at Clovenfords this Sunday.Scottish

four-fold in the space of a year.According to figures just released by the Trussell Trust, foodbank use in the Borders has risen by  percent in  months - the highest percentage rise of any local authority area in Scotland.The Trussell Trust, which support a network of  foodbanks operating out of more than  centres across the UK, have reported that between April and September , a total of  emergency food parcels were issued in the Scottish Borders  to adults and  to children.And many other locally-organised foodbank services arent even included in the figures.In comparison, the same period in  saw just  being issued.Despite the percentage increase, the number of parcels issued this year in the Borders remain the lowest in Scotland over the same period.The figures also report a UK-wide increase of  percent in providing emergency supplies to people in crisis.The charity claims the rise in reliance on foodbanks coincides with the UK Governmentrsquos Universal Credit rollout, which was introduced in the Borders during the summer.The charity says the inability of benefit levels to cover essential living costs and issues with payments remains the most common reasons for referral to a foodbank.They said: ldquoUniversal Credit is not the only benefit people at foodbanks are experiencing problems with, but the new system is increasingly driving referrals due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.The charity is calling for the five week minimum wait for a first Universal Credit payment to be reduced.Emma Revie, Chief Executive of The Trussell Trust explained: ldquoWersquore seeing soaring levels of need at foodbanks. The time to act is now. If the five week wait isnrsquot reduced, the only way to stop even more people being forced to foodbanks this winter will be to pause all new claims to Universal Credit, until funding is in place to reduce the five week wait. Foodbanks cannot continue to pick up the pieces ndash we have to make sure our benefits system can protect people from hunger.Commenting on the figures, Tweeddale MSP Christine Grahame said: ldquoThese are truly heart-breaking figures for the Borders, which bring into sharp focus the devastating impact the Tory government is having on our local community.ldquoThe fact that people cannot afford to eat is a disgrace in any circumstances, but we can see from the statistics that in the previous year there have been  incidences where emergency food has been given to children specically ndash this is an abomination in a developed country such as ours.ldquoWhile sustained Tory cuts have created this problem, we can see that where Universal Credit has rolled out, which is the case in the Borders, it has made things worse.ldquoMichelle Ballantyne MSP who is the Toryrsquos Social Security spokesperson, represents the South of Scotland which covers the Borders ndash despite her ardent defence of Universal Credit in parliament recently, she must see now how devastating this roll out has been.\"I call on her to review her position and urgently press her colleagues at Westminster to halt the roll out of UC, so the fundamental flaws can be addressed.In response Michelle Ballantyne MSP said: ldquoWhile Ms Grahame might be correct that foodbank usage has risen across the UK, she might want to look closer before placing all the blame with the UK Government.\"We should also remember that, despite this increase, foodbank usage in the Borders is still at the lowest number in Scotland.ldquoI would consider it narrow-minded to attribute the entire increase with Universal Credit there are many other factors contributing to foodbank usage across the country.\"Aberdeen City Council and Perth and Kinross have also implemented Universal Credit around the same time as the Borders and the same report notes that foodbank usage has actually decreased in these areas.ldquoHer assertion that Universal Credit is the sole reason that foodbank usage is rising in the Borders just doesnrsquot add up.ldquoI appreciate there are issues with Universal Credit and the UK Government has said they will address them. An example of this is the announcement that there will be increased work allowances which will give a boost to hundreds of thousands of people including a pound boost for couples with children.ldquoI suggest that Ms. Grahame spend less time scaremongering and instead focus on how we can address the drivers of poverty instead."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-of-the-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, features Willow and Mittens.The charity told us: \"This lovely pair of nine-year-old sisters came into the centre as they couldnt live with the dogs in their previous home.

Perhaps a little too early for the jumpers, I attended the Memorial Hall eager to feast upon the much-anticipated performance of these young thespians.Could they really deliver this magical Christmas story and live up to the incredible reputation set by their mentors, Innerleithen  District Amateur Operatic Society  You bet your bottom dollar they did!From the moment the music started and the curtain opened on this stunning production, I along with the audiences were captivated.Playing the hopeful orphan was Freya Wilson. She already looked the part with red hair and freckles, and with stunning vocals she belted out classics lsquoTomorrowrsquo and lsquoMaybersquo, which I have no doubt produced a few tears from the audience. She embraced the character with her cheeky charm and wit, and carried out the role of the ever-optimistic character beautully.Hatching a plan to escape the orphanage and find her parents, Annie is helped by her urchin friends, who had the crowdrsquos toes-tapping and knees bouncing to a fantastically choreographed lsquoHard Knock Lersquo. Credit where itrsquos due, this incredible young cast, who reprised their roles as servants and New Yorkers, were amazing, bringing le to the entire show.But Anniersquos cunning plan to escape fails, and it isnrsquot long before she is dragged back to the evil clutches of the vile Miss Hannigan, played by Lizzie Bell. What was in the champagne bottle, I do not know, but the teenager stumbled about the stage, and conveyed the child-hating orphanage boss to comic perfection. Hanniganrsquos flirtatious manner with Officer Ward , who brings Annie back after running away, had the audience chuckling, and truly convinced us of her distaste for the girls in her care with a jaw-dropping performance of lsquoLittle Girlsrsquo.Anniersquos capture isnrsquot the end of her adventure, itrsquos only just begun, as she s in perfect time to meet Grace Farrell.Miss Farrell is gracefully played by the suave and sophisticated Ava Church, dressed impeccably as the rsquos private secretary to Oliver Warbucks. Annie cheekily seizes a golden opportunity to spend Christmas with Mr Warbucks, and is swept off to live the le of royalty at his mansion.Annie soon melts the heart of wealthy businessman Oliver Warbuckswho gave an endearing performance as the billionaire. The two gave a heart-warming rendition of lsquoI Donrsquot Need Anything But Yoursquo. This will be Thomasrsquos first and last performance with KIYT, but Irsquom sure it wonrsquot be last wersquoll see of this talented young man.After promising to help Annie find her parents, in step the villains of the show ndash scheming Rooster Hannigan and his ditzy blonde girlfriend Lily St Regis.Together with Miss Hannigan, the three plot to swindle Mr Warbucks out of a , dollar reward by posing as Anniersquos parents.Alex Paterson pulls off the flashy self-assured gangster brilliantly, and with his money-grabbing side-kick Lily St Regis, the two are perfectly paired bringing not only the comic element to the show, but impeccable American accents, which polished off their characters.Now at this point I must declare my motherly interest, as Lily was played by my daughter Neve Scott. It is very dficult for one to critic her own child. However, I am very proud to call her a vain, blonde bimbo, red-lipstick wearing, smoking, winey voiced, floozy!The three baddies gave a show-stopping performance of lsquoEasy Streetrsquo which had the audiences in stitches.True to the classic, their evil plotting is foiled and Annie has her happy ending after being adopted by Mr Warbucks. The whole cast came out in glorious chorus for the finale of lsquoTomorrowrsquo.There is one furry four-legged actor who deserves a mention for his tail-wagging performance, the adorable Harry who is no stranger to the spotlight after his dog debut as Toto in the Operarsquos lsquoThe Wizard of Ozrsquo. Stardom beckons for the pooch, whom Irsquom sure could be crowned a Peeblesshire Pet Idol in the future!Praise swept over social media for the young cast last week, leaving many hoping this will be the first of many shows by the talented KIYT cast.

I hope that nightmare prospect really focuses minds in the days ahead.There is nothing to stop the SNP and Labour backing the deal. It achieves key goals set out in their own Brexit plans, like protecting trade and citizensrsquo rights.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

ldquoThese recommendations would ensure Scotland was among the most-prepared countries in the world in getting ready to take the opportunities brought by automation, ageing and the economic change we face over the coming years.These changes could bring ldquosignicant reform to the skills system in Scotland, aiding Scotlandrsquos ability to prepare for automation and ageing, the report added.In turn, this would help the country ldquotransition from the economy of now to what we will need in the future.The IPPR Scotlandreport said currently ldquotoo many young people leave the skills system too soon, never to , going on to enter ldquolow-paid and insecure work that for too many become low-paid and insecure careers.In Scotland, .% of workers aged  to  are in ldquoinsecure employment ndash which includes temporary jobs and zero hours contracts ndash as are % of those aged over .The report called for those working to boost workersrsquo skills to do more to help employees in the middle of their careers.The think tank also wants a committee on the future economy to be set up in Scotland, based on the one established in Singapore in .Mr Gunson said: ldquoIf the last  years have been, rightly, about expanding higher education to help Scotland to transition to a knowledge-led economy, then the next  years need to be about expanding lelong learning to take the opportunities of automation and ageing.ldquoFrom our research, we believe that investment in education and training, and lelong learning in particular, will be the single most important way to get Scotland ready to take the advantages coming our way through technological change.ldquoScotlandrsquos education and training system has some great strengths but it has a long way to go before itrsquos ready.ldquoThere is no doubt that preparing for this scale of change will be expensive and wonrsquot come cheap. However, the costs of not investing could be far more signicant than doing so.The Scottish Government said it will consider the recommendations fully.A spokesman said: ldquoEnsuring Scotland has a skilled and productive workforce, both now and in future, is central to our ambitions for our labour market and economy.ldquoThe IPPRrsquos report underlines the importance of Scotlandrsquos skills system meeting our future skills needs, given the importance of issues such as changing workforce demographics, the potential impact of technological change and the great uncertainty brought about by Brexit.ldquoThe report recognises that Scotlandrsquos skills system is both on the right track and has strong foundations to build on."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/9073403.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"theresa-may-to-take-brexit-talks-to-the-wire","story":"Mrs May is set to hold more talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Junker on Saturday in a down to the wire bid to try and secure a withdrawal agreement at an emergency EU summit scheduled for Sunday.In a surprise move after talks with Mr Juncker in Brussels on Wednesday night, Mrs May insisted she would press on to attempt to secure an agreement.The PM said: ldquoWe have made further progress.

Oliver looks way younger than  years on this planet would suggest, and is relaxed, yet on the clock, given one of his brood has to picked up from school in an hour.He certainly has the energy to undertake a tour of the great theatre halls of the land with his new show, telling of the British Isles in  Places, Glasgow this week which expands upon the detail in his new book of the same title. But his is all new to him  ldquoIrsquove spoken in public before, at literary festivals, but not night after night, he says. ldquoI only get a couple of days off during the months and itrsquos quite intense and nerve wracking. Having said that, itrsquos a fascinating and very dferent way of seeing a country. And it makes you question the notion of what a country is. Once you interrogate this notion you realise the audience in the North East [of England], for example, is a very dferent tribe from those in the South.\"You get this throughout Scotland as well. The iety of what you find leaves you confused. At times you donrsquot know where you are.But there is a commonality, I ask. Arent we all in the same boat ndash one which seems to be sinking  He doesnrsquot think so. ldquoWersquove been through everything, from invasion to natural disaster to famine to religious fundamentalism, he says. ldquoWersquove been through civil war, wars of independence, the industrial revolution, two world wars. All of this has unfolded in the same tapestry. This is just a period in history. In a  years there will be dferent issues and a dferent set of politics.Thatrsquos a comfort. Sort of. But meantime, what do we do about Brexit, Neil  ldquoI donrsquot want to deal in that, he says, placing his coffee cup down with a slightly emphatic clump, suggesting hersquos learned to avoid controversy. ldquoIrsquom careful not to offer an opinion on any of that. My tour aim is to put an arm around the shoulder of someone I care about, which is this archipelago. Itrsquos a love letter to the British Isles, a spectacular place which has looked after me, and now itrsquos my turn to look after him ndash or her.He offers a thought: ldquoThe motto of the Isle of Man, lsquoWhichever way you throw me I will standrsquo, the three legged symbol, I think thatrsquos a great motto for people to live by.Thatrsquos easy to say, but wersquore facing confusion, polarisation of politics, right-wing extremism. You must be afraid of the isions politics has produced and the invective that comes with it  It seems everyone wants to be angry.ldquoIrsquom sick of politics, he admits. ldquoIrsquom completely disenchanted with all of it. Politicians lack so much knowledge. If Irsquom honest, I donrsquot think therersquos a politician out there worth listening to, of any creed or colour. I donrsquot have any truck with any of them. Irsquom just looking away at the moment while they do what they do, which is self-aggrandizing and performing their Punch and Judy nonsense. I cannot be bothered with it.He adds: ldquoI was in that arena vaguely for a while on account of a few opinions I was invited to give.He certainly was. Oliver incurred the wrath of the Nationalists back in  when he declared independence for Scotland a \"dead dog.\"But does he now regret becoming involved in the independence debate He pauses for thought. ldquoNo, I think itrsquos important to say what you think is true. But I donrsquot like the atmosphere at the moment whereby you canrsquot say what you think. If you are not pleasing the social media mob you are silenced or destroyed. I was asked some questions and I gave an honest answer.Oliver rejects the offer of half a sconeand instead sips at his coffee cup. ldquoHow it really started for me was when I was being interviewed for Bannockburn  [his TV show] and a journalist asked me about the referendum. ldquoI remember saying, lsquoA referendum is like going shopping for food when yoursquore hungry.rsquo You donrsquot want to be making snap decisions.Because you come away with a packet of Hobnobs and a jar of Nutella  ldquoExactly. I donrsquot think we should have referendums to decide which side of the road we should drive on, never mind kicking the ball back to the general population to determine a nationrsquos destiny. Thatrsquos why we have political democracy, whereby we employ hundreds of people to read tedious paperwork, shout and bawl at each other in a room for as long as it takes. Thatrsquos why these -odd people have a job.He becomes more animated. ldquoReferendums are a bad idea. After the Scottish referendum there were immediate cries for another one. lsquoThat disnae countrsquo. Now therersquos been Europe. And that was seen to be wrong. And so you claim for another one. What do you do  Go for best of three  Or best of five Oliver smiles. ldquoIrsquove never been a card-carrying member of a political party. I used to scoff at university friends who were. In the same way I couldnrsquot understand why anyone would get excited about football. Irsquom not minded that way.Yet, but he is minded to recognise how politics overlaps into culture and issues of identity, which he loves to wax lyrical about on his TV shows. But there are those who donrsquot countenance his passion for explaining the likes of Iona and the coming of Christianity. Some, such as Professor Tom Devine, see Oliver as an irritant.The historian once attacked the fact Oliver had been asked to front a History of Scotland ndash given he didnrsquot have a degree in history.Oliver didnrsquot take Devinersquos comment laying down however, describing the historian as being like of the old grumps from The Muppets.More recently, Oliver got it in the neck when appointed president of the National Trust for Scotland, and many Nationalists demanded his removal, which seemed odd given the TV presenterrsquos passion for this space we live in.But the writer presenter took it on broad shoulders. Did his personal history prepare him for the future stre  Seems so. Hersquos used to adjustment. ldquoI was born in a council flat in Renfrew, my dad moved to Ayr to work [he was a commission salesman] and then to Dumfries. The family was ldquocomfortable, he says. It certainly wasnrsquot an Angelarsquos Ashes set in Scotland storyline. They even managed a holiday to Spain once.Yet, the man who would go on to explain the Picts and Vikings and anacyclosis to uswasnrsquot top of the class at school. ldquoI was in the upper half but I wasnrsquot so great at maths and science so I focused on English and history, which I was quite good at.Oliver was blessed with encouraging parents who most likely were baffled why their son wanted to study archaeology, University I fell in love with the prospectus given it rarely leads to a career. ldquoI did work as an excavator for a few years going on digs, he recalls. ldquoIt was fun, but there was no money in it. And during the winters it became a bit grim.One Friday afternoon he was excavating the Roman Road in Greenock, and on the Monday he was covering a peace protest in Lockerbie for the local newspaper. Why the switch to journalism ldquoI liked the idea of journalism because it was essentially noseyness about people, he explains, grinning. ldquoItrsquos a bit like archaeology in that itrsquos the chance to poke through the rubbish, to find out what people were doing and why. Instinctively, I want to know who, what, where, why and when.Journalism has been as important to his current career, he says, as his time spent scraping dirt with a big spoon. ldquoWhen Irsquove been cast in the likes of Coast as a presenter it helped me get something out of people. And this Magpie-like work taught me how to become engrossed in a subject for a day then drop it, and move onto something .The curious mind continued to search for the next adventure and in  he joined a BT internet company. ldquoI thought that may be my future. I was also fascinated to learn how it had evolved, largely financed by the US military, who wanted to knowcomputers could survive after a nuclear attack. And so they hired these hippies to find out. And then I wondered what do we do with it  What are the consequences of it He answers his own question: ldquoItrsquos created titans such as Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon, Google and Pay Pal. He adds in soft, serious voice, ldquoNow, Zuckerberg is almost at the point he has more power than Putin, without the missiles.While working for the internet company, Oliver decided to set off for Zululand.ldquoI had met up with my close pal from university Tony Pollard one day in the Granary Bar in Glasgowrsquos Shawlands and we came up with the idea of going to Zululand to make a film [which became the BBCrsquos  documentary, Two Men In A Trench].Boldness has to be part of the reason for Oliverrsquos success. He had a good job, with a good salary, a car and an Amex account. ldquoBut I didnrsquot have a mortgage. I wasnrsquot married. I could take a chance. And I knew I had had experience. When the TV job ran out Irsquod do something .Does the job flipping suggest a malcontent  ldquoNo, when I was at BT I figured Irsquod give it a couple of years, he says with a wee hint of umbrage in his voice for me having suggested such a thing. ldquoAnd we made the film really because we wanted to go to South Africa. The voice warms again: ldquoArchaeology was my first love and we met again. It was like Friends Reunited. And wersquove been together ever since.Hersquos a television natural. But did he always feel confident speaking to the camera  ldquoYes. Irsquove always had a good memory and Irsquom lucky in that I can remember  words in the right order, he says, grinning. ldquoTalking to the camera is not a natural thing to do. Itrsquos like a golf swing. But some people can do it. And I enjoyed being with these like-minded people. It was quite collegiate. I loved it from the get-go.Oliver landed on the box at the right time. ldquoI was   when television began to happen for me. I had few delusions about my own reality. Irsquod been in a few dferent jobs, had the rougher edges knocked off by le experience. Irsquod filled shelves at Presto supermarket while eating the Mars Bars. Irsquod worked on an MS till. He adds, with a wry smile, ldquoIrsquod been dumped often enough by women.Women. Yes, now hersquos married to one. And history taught him he should incorporate this woman into his future. Oliver met his future we Trudi when he was at university. ldquoI was in third year at the time, the president of the archaeology society and she was in first year, and she came in to join. I made a bee-line for her when she walked in the door.He grins. ldquoI donrsquot think she was as impressed by me as I was by her.She must have liked him a little because the pair were together for seven years. ldquoAnd it just sort of fizzled out. Then, years later, I met her wee brother Johnny and we swapped numbers and a few months after that I was back in touch with Trudi. It was asIrsquod seen her the day before.He reflects: ldquoThatrsquos another great thing about my le. Whatever happens, I know Irsquom with someone who remembers me when I was  and a silly arse. She remembers me when I had all sorts of archaeology student affectations, all patchouli oil and cheese cloth shirts. We can remember the teenagers we were.Oliver reveals he had the long hair back in the day. He didnrsquot create the soft Tarzan look for telly. He has just never bothered to have it cut. And it works for him, gives him a USP, although watching him on TV with the wind blasting into his face as he stands on a clf edge he does have to brush it away from his mouth a little too often but, I suppose, a kirby grip or a hair scrunchy would wreck the image.He laughs. ldquoIrsquove been holding out for the Head and Shoulders contract for  years but itrsquos never happened.Therersquos a calm about Oliver, even though he does become animated when he talks about the politics he says he wants nothing to do with. And he clearly loves his le, beaming at the delights of a career which allows him to take his family adventuring in the likes of Australia and New Zealand while filming Coast. Yet with three children hersquos not immune to worry, about the impact of social media, for example. ldquoPeople can have , friends, but ironically they have never been more isolated and lonelier. People go to Facebook ndash I donrsquot ndash hoping to see other people in this clearing in the forest who are equally lonely.Hersquos happy however, very happy. ldquoThe thing I most love these days is writing. I wrote as a student, as a journalist and then in TV with scripts. Irsquove written ten books or so and itrsquos something Irsquoll be able to do.And now hersquos making live appearances. ldquoIrsquove sort of blundered into them. Irsquom out there talking about our world, like Simon Reeve and Dan Snow. Maybe I can do this every year. Why not So the world will be all right, Neil  We need you to tell us it will be. ldquoWe tend to think this is a modern concern, but perhaps Stonehenge and Avebury are partly expressions of feeling the same concerns, people feeling they are little specks in the great scheme of things and wanting to be heard, to make a mark.He grins, reassuringly. ldquoWersquoll be fine, but I wonrsquot beI donrsquot do this school pick-up in time.Neil Oliver ndash The Story of the British Isles in  Places, the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-insider-guide-stornoway","story":"But therersquos so much more to the Hebridean capital than just great views.

But theres a time when resilience turns into defiance, and then defiance turns into delusion. Theresa Mayrsquos staying power is the nations curse, as she perseveres with a orce deal which has no hope. She has finally united Leavers and Remainers, but only to the extent that theyrsquore against her. Shes lost both her Brexit Secretaries, a host of ministers and both houses of parliament. But, like Monty Pythonrsquos limbless Black Knight, she battles on regardless.MPs on all sides say the European Court of Justice will continue to have effective jurisdiction over UK laws on things like state aid, labour conditions, environmental standards and tax. Theresa May insists it wonrsquot, and that by , a deep and meaningful future trading relationship will have been negotiated, which will make the backstop unnecessary. But that is a triumph of hope over experience. No one has yet come up with a way of ensuring frictionless trade that doesnt involve either membership of the Customs Union, or accepting many of the rules of the European Single Market. If you keep all or part of the single market you keep the ECJ.This doesnt mean that the ECJ is involved in every negotiation. There is to be an arbitration  to sort out everyday problems between the EU and UK. But when it comes to a dispute on EU law, the ECJ rulings are final. That is crystal clear in Article  of the Withdrawal Agreement which says that the ECJ ldquoshall have jurisdiction to make such a ruling, which will be binding on the arbitration .Theres nothing sinister in this ndash except in the eyes of paranoid europhobes. When you join a tennis club, no one complains that your rights and liberties are being removed just because you accept the rules. The real issue is whether you have any say in the making of them. Democracy demands that members of an international trading organisation should have have a share in the decision-making process. This is where the Withdrawal Agreement, indeed the whole Brexit project falls down, because as things stand, we dont. We will be rule takers.Theresa May realised very early on that the economic cost of leaving the EU completely was just too high. She gave assurances to all those big international companies like Nissan, Siemens and Rolls Royce, who have complex, just-in-time supply chains, that she would negotiate a deal that was at least as good as the single market. She effectively promised no tarfs, border checks or regulatory issues ndash ie no ldquofriction - between Britain and the EU. She had to, or theyd have upped and left . Components for Vauxhall cars are said to cross and recross EU borders at least  times before theyre finally assembled in Ellesmere Port.But removing tarf and non-tarf barriers is precisely what the Customs Union and the European Single Market were originally created to do. The EU is first of all a free trade area, the most comprehensive in the world. When Britain decided to leave, it meant that frictions would inevitably . Theresa May has been trying to square the circle ever since: getting the benefits of a single market without being in it.Shes achieved quite a lot, to give her credit. Under her orce deal, Britain gets broad access in to the single market in goods without having to accept free movement. But the cost was always going to be some continued observance of the EUrsquos regulations, plus ECJ oversight. Weve had to agree to ldquodynamic alignment with EU regulations, meaning that when they change in future Britain will have to go along with the new rules.The obvious solution might be to just join the single market, as Norway did after . It is not in the EU, the Common Fisheries Policy or the Common Agricultural Policy. This is Nicola Sturgeons preferred option, and she said last week thatScotland even got the same deal as Northern Ireland, which is to remain largely in the ESM, she would vote for the Withdrawal Agreement. But while this Norway option has worked after a fashion, it has powerful critics. It costs quite a lot, and there have long been complaints in Oslo about ldquofax democracy - that new laws are simply faxedfrom Brussels. But hey ndash thats just how these things work. You are either in the EU or you arent.So what happens now  Mays deal wont fly, yet she stands her ground. The deal will almost certainly be rejected in parliament, even though Labour dont really have a coherent alternative. Jeremy Corbyn was scathing about Mayrsquos ldquobotched deal, but he too wants to leave the EU. Nor do Labour wish Britain to be a formal member of the Customs Union or the European Single Market. John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, says he would renegotiate the deal to achieve a ldquoclose and collaborative relationship with the single market. In other words, a better deal than Mayrsquos. But the German Chancellor, Angela Merkell, has made clear that negotiations are over. End of story.Faced with a disastrous no deal, and no prospect of renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement, the opposition parties face a very hard parliamentary choice next month. Do they join with Jacob Rees Mogg and the DUP, and vote for an economic disaster which would damage the livelihoods of countless Labour voters  Or do they suck it up, back Theresa May and then blame the Tories in future for landing Britain with such a bad settlement  If they vote down Mayrsquos orce deal, they must know that renegotiation is not now an option. Nor is a general election, because the Tories wonrsquot vote, like turkeys, for an early Christmas. The only alternative is for the opposition parties to do what they should have done months ago: unite the Remain majority in the House of Commons to demand a delay on Article , and then force May to hold a repeat referendum.If parliament cant decide what to do, the only option is to hand it back to the people who got us into this mess in the first place: the voters."},{"url":null,"title":"the-cool-list-hotels","story":"Built in  by Lord MacDonald of Sleat and once surrounded by orange trees ndash hence the hotelrsquos name ndash Marmalade is a -minute walk from Portree harbour and offers fine views over Portree Bay and to the Cuillins beyond.

Of  Green Deal loans in Scotland from HELMS, % of them have payback period of  years or more.\"Anyone aged  or above taking out a loan could be stuck with this until they reach pension age and clearly older tenants should never have been allowed to access finance over such a period.\"Derek Mitchell, chief executive of Citizens Advice Scotland said consumers were entitled to be treated fairly and expect action to be taken taken when they are not.He said: \"A company like HELMS should not have been able to treat people as it did, and while they are undoubtedly the bad guys here, there are clear lessons to be learned about how to make sure this does not happen again.\"But for now our main focus is on the people who have suffered at the hands of this company. That is why we are calling on the UK government to ensure every HELMS client is contacted.\"He said CAS had great respect for those who have sought redress so far, but suspected they were just the \"tip of the iceberg\".Mr Mitchell added that the government must ensure every complaint about HELMS or its associated companies is independently investigated and redress is provided.A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \"Where customers believe they have been mis-sold they are able to take their complaints direct to the Green Deal Finance Companywho can cancel or reduce loansthe evidence supports this.\""},{"url":null,"title":"letters-what-the-country-needs-now-is-politicians-of-principle","story":"That is the nub of the matter. The effect on society has now become secondary to political dogma. We are in this current predicament because a weak Tory Government is in thrall to a right wing which wishes to turn us back into a lone, island nation in the Atlantic, yearning for the days of Empire. The Labour Opposition will vote against whatever deal is proposed regardless of whether it is the land of milk and honey promised by the leading Brexiters. Its sole aim is to discomfit the Government in an attempt to force an election and thereby gain power. The SNP see the shambles as a godsend in their pursuit of independence.Oh, for politicians like Teddy Taylor, John Smith or Charles Kennedy whose aimwas the good of their constituents and our nation.Jim Coley,Calderwood Road, Rutherglen, Glasgow.THE pages of history are littered with examples where the stubbornness and determination of a leader have simply served to worsen what was already a desperate situation. While Theresa May has to be commended for her survival skills, we surely have reached a point where her actions are compounding the serious errors of judgement that have characterised her troubled premiership.Having campaigned, albeit somewhat half-heartedly, to Remain, she succeeded David Cameron and proceeded to give key Cabinet posts to arch-Brexiters whose febrile anti-EU rhetoric has come back to haunt her. She has consistently failed to take them on and to discipline them for their all-too obvious disloyalty to her premiership.Presumably it was to appease them that she made the awful mistake of triggering Article  in March . By doing this she set the exit clock ticking before any serious due diligence had been carried out as to the drastic consequences of Brexit for the UK. As a result, we are playing a desperate game of catch-up. Scarcely a week goes by without another sector of our community flagging up serious worries and concerns. Permanent damage has already been done, witness the number of companies and organisations choosing now to relocate where. They are highly unlikely to ever come back to the UK. Some of this harm could at least have been predicted and considered before that fateful triggering of Article .Then in April , Mrs May opportunistically called a General Election rather than wait for  as laid down in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act . Here was yet another mistake as with her Parliamentary majority gone, she has had to rely on the dubious ndash and costly ndash support of the DUP.To make matters worse, in September  in her Florence speech, Mrs May laid down the \"red lines\" that would underpin the UKrsquos negotiating position. It was clear at once that her determination to leave the customs union and to end the free movement of EU nationals threatened aof a hard Irish border. To believe that the EU would compromise on its founding principles to accommodate the departing UK was fatally flawed.Eric Melvin, Cluny Place, Edinburgh.IN your coverage of the Brexit crisis, you carried a piece with the headline \"Mundell may quitUK tied to EU fishing\"which I read in conjunction with Owen Kellyrsquos description of David Mundellas lsquothis most inconsequential of politicians\". Why our Secretary of Statersquos apparent threat of resigning merits a headline is beyond me ndash frankly, who would notice, or care,he did go  Mr Kellyrsquos description is quite accurate, and I hardly think Theresa May is going to lose any sleep over Mr Mundellrsquos eventual decision around his recently-acquired interest in the fishing industry.At another level, it is of some consequence that we have a Secretary of State unable to make any political utterance that doesnrsquot include a Pavlovian request to the SNP to take a second independence referendum off the table. Constructive policies, as with Ruth Davidson, are nowhere to be seen. In this respect, Mr Mundellrsquos vacuity is emblematic, of course, of the Toriesrsquo indference to Scotland and its distinctive needs. So perhaps he has the usefulof reminding us of this, and holding it in mind come the next election. In the meantime, my advice to Mr Mundell is: just go now, and go back to your knitting.Dr Angus Macmillan, Georgetown Road, Dumfries.AS a citizen of Scotland, the UK and Europe I would urge First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP not to get into bed ndash metaphorically speaking ndash with the ideological purists and the to-hell-with-the-consequences led by Jacob Rees-Mogg by voting down the agreed deal between the EU and the UK.It would be absurd and sad to see the progressive SNP vote on the same side as a bunch of reactionary Tories. Surely that cannot and will not happen.As independent-minded people I am sure that our Westminster SNP members can see the reckless folly of the path being pursued by Mr Rees-Mogg and his cohorts. If they cannot then Britain and particularly Scotland will pay a high price.David McMillan, Strathmore Avenue, Paisley.NICOLA Sturgeon faces signicant challenges ahead,she attempts to demand an independence referendum be held in the short to medium term.She was of course rejected in March  by Theresa May because of Brexit uncertainty. Eighteen months on its clear \"now is [still] not the time\". The UK Government is in a state of massive upheaval and seemingly no one has a clear view of what Brexit may mean, or indeed whether itll definitely happen. Possibly Mrs Mays compromise will be rejected by the Commons we may have a new prime minister and or there may be another General Election leading to either a Labour or a Tory government ndash theyre close in opinion polls. Should or can another deal be negotiated with Brussels  Will there be another EU referendum ndash and what question would be asked  Again opinion polls predict another close result.\"Now is not the time\" is an even more appropriate response to the SNP leader than last March.Brexit may be the drama du jour but our relationship with the EU will feature heavily in British politics for many years.

We are now at the margins of being able to provide a viable music tuition service\".Mr Dodds said a % discount is available for siblings, while those receiving free schools meals or sitting an SQA music exam do not pay.However he said some pupils may be opting to study music simply so they can afford to continue with the additional tuition.Councillor Willie Wilson, of Perth and Kinross Council, said it introduced a % hike in fees last year after a six-year freeze ndash the equivalent of around pound extra annually.Glasgow brought in charges around a decade ago but quickly reversed the decision amid declining numbers.MSPs were previously told the introduction of fees for music tuition in Scottish schools had led to more than , fewer pupils learning an instrument in just one year.Ten councils currently charge for tuition, with fees ranging from a few pounds a week to more than pound a year in Clackmannanshire.Holyroods ongoing inquiry into the issue was sparked after a petition calling for free musical instrument tuition to be made a statutory right was signed by nearly , people."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-theresa-may-plans-brussels-dash-for-last-minute-talks-before-summit","story":"After a -minute meeting in the Belgian capital with Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission, the Prime Minister emerged to say that ldquofurther progress had been made.ldquoAs a result we have given sufficient direction to our negotiators, I hope, for them to be able to resolve the remaining issues.

This contrasted starkly with the near universal provision of calorie and nutrient information on pre-packaged products available in retail outlets.FSS also suggests using greater promotion and marketing to encourage consumers to choose healthier options and said it would be encouraging food businesses to take their own voluntary measures to change their promotion and marketing practices.\"Caterers, manufacturers and businesses who supply food for the catering industry all have a role in reducing calories and resetting the norms away from excessive consumption,\" said the FSS. It said that food outside the home could be improved by businesses dropping practices that encourage overeating while postively marketing and promoting fruit and vegetables.There are , restaurants, supermarkets, takeaways and food delivery services who sell food on-the-go in Scotland. Approximately half of so-called out of home visits in Scotland are made to branded businesses and half are made to independent businesses.Ross FinnieChips, cakes and pastries, specialty coffees and sugary soft drinks are among the top foods and drinks purchased outside the home.The FSS said that given the high calorie content of these types of foods, there is a need to \"rebalance the out of home offering towards more nutritious lower calorie menu options\".Obesity and diet related ill health is one of Scotlandrsquos biggest health concerns, costing around pound. bn every year.FSS says that with two thirds of adults in Scotland already overweight or obese, the health consequences of a poor diet are \"already very real\" and they impact the nationrsquos economy and productivity.It is estimated that up to a quarter of our calories may come from eating outside the home and the FSS says \"it is important that the out of home sector plays its part to improve the Scottish diet\".Mr Finnie added: \"Given that this sector is projected to grow, change is needed now to make out of home food and drink healthier. Clear calorie labelling is also crucial to enable consumers to make informed choices about the food they buy and eat outside the home.\"Responses to the FSS consultation will be used to guide the development of an overarching Out of Home Strategy for consideration by the FSS Board, with recommendations being provided to Scottish ministers next year."},{"url":null,"title":"hannah-bardell-refuses-to-apologise-after-being-shown-red-card-for-playing-football-in-commons","story":"John Bercow reprimanded the Livingston MP and some of her team-mates, who were kitted out in football jerseys, saying the \"historic\" chamber should not be used for a kick-about, adding he had received \"fulsome\" letters of apology from three of the five MPs involved.In a Commons statement, he told MPs: \"It has been brought to my attention that some football skills were displayed in the chamber yesterday evening after the House rose.\"I am informed that the doorkeepers on duty told the members concerned that the chamber was not the place for this activity.

A spokesman noted how last week the PM had said thatMPs voted down her deal, ldquonobody can know for sure the consequences that will flow from that it would be to take a path of deep and grave uncertainty.But when it was pointed out Mrs May had given Ms McVey an assurance on leaving the EU, the spokesman replied: ldquoThe PM is determined she is going to ensure that we leave the EU on March , which is what the British people voted for.Hang on. Ms Rudd said a no-deal was not possible and Mrs May said there could be no BrexitMPs rejected her deal, so how could she say for certain the UK would leave the EU next March  No  simply repeated how the PM was determined to get her deal through ndash and that was that.Of course, one of the many complicating factors in this game of D political chess is that the Democratic Unionists, whose  MPs prop up the minority Tory Government, are in a huff over the withdrawal plan, believing it sets out the path to the break-up of the UK.Earlier this week, Mrs May and her colleagues had the humiliation of a seeing the DUP vote against part of the Finance Bill and b accepting opposition amendments for fearthey went to a vote, they would be voted down thanks to Nigel Dodds and his chums.No , in another show of bravado, insisted the so-called confidence and supply deal with the DUP, was \"intact\". Another insider declared: ldquoIrsquom not aware of any change to its status, noting how the DUP itself had said it was still alive.Hang on. The DUP are breaching the deal by voting against the Government. But the spokesman noted how it was only one vote and ldquowe won it by five votes.Askedthe PM could rely on the DUP, he replied: ldquoI have given you my answer.Earlier during a less-than-easy PMQs Mrs May had to face hostile questions not only from Jeremy Corbyn and Ian Blackford but also from some of her own MPs, urging her to change tack.One Tory backbencher suggested that her withdrawal plan would threaten the integrity of the UK, at which the DUPrsquos Mr Dodds was nodding vigorously.The Belfast North MP noted how, in the December joint UK-EU report, it was agreed Northern Ireland would have the ldquofinal say on whether it erged from the UK single market, the so-called ldquoStormont lock, but this bit had been deleted from the draft withdrawal agreement.Mrs May replied that the matter of regulations was for Westminster and, anyhow, Stormont had not sat for two years.Hang on. So why put the Stormont lock in the December report anyway The No  spokesman, also noting how Stormont was not currently in existence, said he had ldquonothing more to add.So, following a bruising PMQs, Mrs May set off for Brussels for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker to try to finalise the so-called future framework that will set out Britainrsquos future relationship with the EU post-Brexit.But things did not seem to be going smoothly. Surprise surprise.One senior German diplomat warned: ldquoIt needs to be finalised or Merkel will not attend. We do not want changes to the text making it even harder for May to agree with.The PM finally emerged from her tea and croissants to say further progress had been made but she would be going back to Brussels for more talks on Saturday, just hours before the planned Sunday summit.So things will, as many predicted, go to the wire and, of course, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.As Alice would say the Brexit process is getting curiouser and curiouser."},{"url":null,"title":"community gathers to remember mark","story":"Staff, parents and children of Logie Durno School gathered together on Friday afternoon to pay tribute to a local father.A remembrance event was held for Mark Mathers, who sadly died following an accident at his work on September .The green balloons were released by Marks family and friendsWhile taking part in the remembrance event, pupils wore ribbons that were green - Mark’s favourite colour.School pupils sang a number of songs at the event before Mark’s family released nine green biodegradable balloons.After the remembrance event was over, Mark’s we Deborah and sons Connor, Arron and Blair presented a cheque for £, to representatives of the Grampian Child Bereavement Network .Speaking to the Herald, Deborah said: “The money was raised at Mark’s funeral.The community gathered to watch the balloons float away“After we had the final total myself and Mark’s father thought about what charity we should donate it to.“We looked at ious charites but we thought it made sense to give it to a local charity that was already helping us.“They are the best people for it as they aren’t well known and we want people to be aware of them and what they do.”She added: “The remembrance event was very well done, but it’s tough for the children to fully understand what is going on.“This is such a small community but everyone has shown a lot of community spirt over the last couple of months and the staff at the school have been amazing.Commenting on the donation Jan Sanders of GCBN said: “For us it’s humbling that people going through something so sad like this choose to support us.“It’s an incredible amont to receive and it is a huge privilege to come here today.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Game of Thrones star Iain Glen may have recovered from deadly greyscale in the epic drama but hes asking his fellow Scots to own up to the inevitable and make a will. \"  \"  What do Iain Glen, Dame Judi Dench, Graham Norton and Robert Peston have in common  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“The money will be used to support other families to help them build hope for the future and to make them smile again.”Grampian Child Bereavement Network is a small charity that provides direct support to bereaved children and young people throughout the region."},{"url":null,"title":"academy hosts art exhibition","story":"Inverurie Academy held its second Art Exhibition on Thursday, November .The exhibition featured ious pieces of artwork by National , Higher and Advanced Higher pupils.Pupil Natalie Thomson with her work Pick  Mix TreatsHead of Creative Arts at Inverurie Academy, Olefine Richardson, said: “This year we have  National  exhibitors, ten Higher and one Advanced Higher.“The work on display is by our th, th and th year pupils.“This is the second year that we have held an art exhibition at the school and it is bigger than last year’s event.“The evening celebrates the pupils’ exceptional work and the phenomenal effort that they have put in to it.Many pupils created designs for new items including an apron, umbrella, and perfume boxes“We are really proud of them all and their hard work.”S Higher pupil Natalie Thomson had her work ‘ Pick  Mix Treats’ on display.Natalie said: “I chose Pick and Mix because it was fun to draw and I could eat it afterwards.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Thursday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmOrkney Archaeology Societywas delighted to announce, this week, that it has received a National Lottery grant of £, for its St Magnus Graffiti Project.

Descendants of both Vice Admiral Fremantle and Rear Admiral von Reuter will be attending the conference.The conference will cover not only the scuttle, but also the history and impact of that fateful day.Speakers will explore the American navy#s vital role in the war, how the scuttle was interpreted in Germany and how the legacy still lives on today.Six months before the centenary itself, this will be a wonderful opportunity to share Scapa#s history, stimulate ideas for  and build a lasting knowledge of what happened and why.Nick Jellicoe will publish two books next year: The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet and, in partnership with the Orcadian, Scuttle to Salvage, a book about in photographs. He is shortly launching a website to support the centenary, Scapaflow and will be producing another animation The Scapa Flow Naval History Conference will take place at Kirkwall Grammar School, Friday and Saturday, November  and .Details on the conference can be found on https:shop.scapaflow copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Thursday  Nov  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

If I have trouble believing her why should I believe him ”Mr Gove said there was a “widespread recognition” that the Common Fisheries Policydid damage.He said: “Whatever position we may have taken in that referendum, taking back control of our waters, leaving the CFP and becoming once again an independent coastal state gives us an opportunity to lead environmentally, to revive the fishing industry economically and to make sure that our coastal communities once more have the opportunity of a renaissance.”SNP trade spokesman Stewart Hosiewarned that given the UK’s “negotiating failure” so far, what the UK would end up with “will look very similar to the terms of the CFP”.Mr Gove denied the claims and said the UK will be negotiating as an “independent coastal state” at the December  fisheries council.Conservative Martin Vickerslater told Mr Gove: “He will know that the industry have long memories and they can remember the last minute sell-out in the original common market negotiations, and they still fear that that is going to happen again.”Mr Vickers asked for assurances that “under no circumstances will further concessions be granted”, and Mr Gove told him: “There’s no way I can ever forget what happened then, and no way that I will be anything other than a resolute champion to the interests of coastal communities like the one that he serves and represents so admirably.”The Cabinet minister went on to say the Government would introduce an approach that means fisherman can catch and land, butthey exceed the discard ban then they will “pay a penalty that will ensure that we have a sustainable approach towards fisheries”.And he said: “This Bill will allow us to decide who catches what and where and in line with what environmental principles.”Shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman said Labour would not oppose the Bill at second reading, saying: “It’s turned out to be a mostly enabling Bill for making future decisions.“However it is clear that the Government has some way to go before we can all be satisfied with what is before us today.”SNP environment spokeswoman Deidre Brock later told MPs the promise of leaving the CFP was nothing more than a “conjurer’s trick”.She said: “The common fisheries policy will carry on regulating our fishing fleets after we leave the EU, taking back control has never sounded so hollow.“The Secretary of State spoke to leaders of the Danish industry last year and guaranteed them continued access to our waters after Brexit, the UK embassy in Spain was reassuring Spanish trawlers earlier this year that their access to UK waters was assured.“The withdrawal bill replaces common decision-making on the CFP as a member of the EU with CFP rules handed down from Brussels and no input from ministers from these isles on behalf of the industry here.“Well done those Brexiteers, you certainly did land a whopper there.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4833154.1542818682!/image/image.jpg","title":"mp criticised by commons speaker after playing football in parliament","story":"An SNP MP has been rebuked by House of Commons Speaker John Bercow after she was filmed in the House of Commons playing with a football and posing for pictures with colleagues.Hannah Bardell, the MP for Livingston, shared a video on her Twitter account performing ‘keepy ups’ with a football as she marked the formation of a Women’s Football Team in parliament. window.twttr The team was due to have their first match yesterday, but it was cancelled, leading the MP, who was previously donned a Scotland shirt in the chamber, to commandeer the House of Commons for an impromptu kickabout. : Hannah Bardell MP slams farcical Theresa MayThey were rebuked by the Speaker John Bercow ahead of business today.Ms Bardell, Labour MPs Louise Hague, Stephanie Peacock, and Alison McGovern, as well as former Tory Sports Minister Tracey Crouch, were pictured on Twitter posing in their parliamentary football team kit.Hannah Bardell told Sky News: “ was a fun way to show that whilst there is much ision on many issues sport and football is something we can all agree on and have some fun with.”However, John Bercow gave a statement to MPs this morning chiding the members involved, denying that he had given permission, and revealing that Ms Peacock, Ms Crouch and Ms Hague had apologised for the incident.

According to Theresa May, Brexit might even not happen at all: she’s now saying we can have no deal, her deal, or no Brexit. Only a few ideologues, on right and left, want no deal. Her deal isn’t a deal at all. It’s a promise to have a deal in two or three or four years’ time. Parliament looks like throwing her plan out anyway. No Brexit flies in the face of the referendum result. To navigate our way out of such a shambles, we have to be frank about how we got into it.It began with a lie: that Britain could leave the EU but still keep all the advantages of membership. We could walk away from the responsibilities and irritations of political union, but still claim all the benefits of the economic union that comes with it. The EU would be so keen to keep us, they’d agree whatever we asked for. We’d be inside it and outside at the same time – inside for the bits we liked, outside for the bits we didn’t. Cake could be had and eaten.Then we moved from cake to fudge. To keep the Tory party together, Mrs May’s approach has been to fudge, postponing the day of reckoning until after we’ve left. No choice had to be made. We can become both Canada and Norway. She’s still trying. It hasn’t united her party, and reality has caught up with her anyway. The rubber hit the road at the Irish border, but this isn’t really an Irish question. Leaving the EU is all about setting up new borders, for trade and regulation. It just happens that the only land border we have with the EU is that fractal line round six Irish counties which we’ve repeatedly promised would never be a hard border again. By its own lights, the EU has been reasonable, accommodating Mrs May’s ambiguity and fudge, but no amount of flexibility can avoid the fact that the EU’s border has to be somewhere, and we have to be inside it or outside it. Remember Schrödinger’s cat, in a box and supposedly alive and dead the same time  The point is that, when you open the box, it turns out to be one or the other.: Fight to defeat Theresa May’s Brexit deal a national ‘emergency’, SNP saysThat’s what Mrs May’s supposed deal tries to avoid: opening the box – making up our mind about the future relationship. But the Irish backstops remind us we must decide whether to be in or out of the EU’s customs and regulatory borders. Out means a border of some sort, either on the island of Ireland or across the Irish Sea. This basic contradiction in the Prime Minister’s position was willed on her by a split party, but her terrible tactics have made things worse. Triggering Article  put a gun to Britain’s head. She didn’t have to set the deadline we are now staring at. Her negotiating position was a criss-cross of red lines, ruling the possible out, and only the impossible in.Now, in the endgame, her tactics could do irreparable harm. Her deal will not survive parliament. Too many oppose it. She needs DUP support, but they know how to say No. Brexiteers denounce her. They cannot depose her, but won’t vote for her plan. Otherwise loyal Tories despair of her. She’s tells her party it’s her deal or no deal: take what’s on the table, or leave with nothing – no transition, no trade deal, no protection for citizens’ rights – only disruption and chaos. But they won’t all vote for it. Nor will the opposition.: Supreme Court rejects UK Government bid to appeal Brexit challengeWhen her deal falls, perhaps we’ll get a new government, maybe after an election. But the underlying problem remains: there’s no magic fix, and the EU is not going to reopen negotiations to listen to more fantasies. They might agree to our leaving the EU but staying in the customs union and single market. That’s what happens in the transition period, and is close to where the proposed backstop will likely take us anyway. This has been promoted by the SNP and is close to Labour policy. It’s clear and simple, but problematic. Outside a political union but in an economic union, the UK would have no say in many of its laws.Meantime, however, Mrs May’s tactics have changed signicantly. So far, she’s threatened no deal to frighten Tory remainers. Now she’s decided to threaten the Brexiteers too, with no Brexit. They’re not both going swallow it. Soher plan falls but her government doesn’t, she will end up offering either no deal or no Brexit.That isn’t a choice for the Government, or even for Parliament, but for the people. They voted for Brexit when told it would be easy. Faced with the no deal prospect – the Government is apparently planning for chaos, even soldiers guarding petrol stations – the choice must go back to the population in another referendum. People in all political parties are now supporting this. Some on the Conservative backbenches, many in the Labour Party , and the Lib Dems and SNP also. If the country faces such a possibility, they all need to get together to deliver a People’s Vote.Let’s not deceive ourselves. Having another referendum might avoid the chaos of no deal, but doesn’t solve every problem. The big political lesson of this decade is that referendums create ision. Remainers might think that another vote will be the end of the matter, but the country needs to address that ision and the economic and social concerns of those who voted leave.

The Cairns of Coll are so small that you have to look quite hard for them on the map, but there they are, some of them not much more than an expanse of rock raised up from the surrounding sea. The largest island is about  acres, a low hill that discloses signs of ancient occupation but is now home only to seabirds and, at its edges, colonies of seals. On one, the most northerly, a small Stevenson lighthouse sits, powered by solar energy, dutully sending out its warning to passing vessels.You can beach a boat here on one of the slopes of pure white sand. You can explore the low saliences that afford a view of the Hebridean Sea to the west, of Rhum, Muck and Eigg to the north, and of the high ramparts of Skye beyond. With exception of the lighthouse, nowhere are the works of man to be seen. There is a beauty here that is beyond price in a world where such places are becoming more and more sullied by the pressure of human population – and by the relentless human desire for more of everything.I was in the fortunate position of being able to buy these islands from the person in Barra who was selling them. Her family had looked after them for years and now she wanted to hand them over. I have no plans to do anything with them – they are to remain pristine, a natural reserve in a world that is increasingly being covered in concrete or stripped of its plants. They will be there for those who can get to them – most often, people going out on whale watching or nature cruises – or for sailors who are able to go ashore and picnic and explore. Divers sometimes land on them and explore the rich seabed around them. I go out there once or twice a year and just stand and breathe in the air and close my eyes, knowing that I am being watched by curious seals, their heads popping up out of the surrounding waters. If anybody really owns these islands, it is those seals.: Kelp ban branded a ‘chilling’ message for scientistsThe marine environment in that part of Scotland is now being threatened by a proposal to license the large-scale commercial harvesting of kelp from the sea-bed. This will involve mechanical removal of kelp forests, essentially stripping them out by their holdfast. The proponents of these schemes say that this can be done only in limited areas and that there will be little overall damage to the seabed and the le systems it sustains. There is weighty evidence from many reputable marine scientists that contradicts this. This technology will destroy the habitat of fish and many other creatures. Our kelp forests should be left untouched – completely. It is no good saying that only a little will be taken , tonnes a year – what the scheme proposes to take – is too much. Even , tonnes a year would be too much for the bit of the sea bed affected.Opposition to this scheme has come from many quarters. No less a naturalist than David Attenborough, whose credentials in the defence of nature are above question, has joined the clamour of protest. Local communities, including fishermen, have made known their opposition to what is proposed. A petition against the proposal has been signed by thousands of people who live in the area and who have a stake in preserving our precious marine environment frm destruction. The matter is to be voted on at Holyrood today. : Kelp dredging  Why it’s time to stop pundering the sea – Jonny HughesEverybody understands that we have to make some use of the sea and that we cannot always leave nature undisturbed. But surely we have to be extremely cautious that any intervention we make in the marine environment is kept to the minimum, and that in particular we should we should avoid industrial activities that will inevitably destroy signicant areas of the marine habitat. Kelp can be harvested, but must be cut by hand, on a controlled scale, rather than left to the mercy of marine combine harvesters.What we lose we cannot always get back. Our poor world is reeling, and as it reels, the metaphors abound. We are now in injury time when it comes to global warming the nuclear disaster clock is set at a few minutes to midnight. Scotland is a tiny bit of our natural world, but it is a precious and lovely part of it. Holyrood is its steward. Those who sit there must listen to the conservationists and scientists who are trying to get them to hear a simple, urgent message: don’t do this.I think of the Cairns of Coll. I think of those waters, those hills, those breathtakingly lovely places that make up the world of the Hebridean islands. The underlying eco-system will unquestionably be harmedlarge scale harvesting of kelp is allowed. There will be fewer fish. There will be less protection for the shoreline. Little marine deserts will be created. So, little by little, we destroy the things we love and need.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4833018.1542811457!/image/image.jpg","title":"pmqs prime minister rejects plea to work with nicola sturgeon on alternative brexit plan","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Theresa May has rejected a call to renegotiate for a softer Brexit.Speaking during Prime Minister’s Questions, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford appealed for her to listen to alternatives to her Brexit deal, but was firmly rebuffed.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon met opposition leaders to try and forge a softer Brexit option on Tuesday, before meeting Mrs May to urge her to change course.: Mike Russell apologises over ‘alien jibe’Mr Blackford said: “The First Minister made it clear there are other alternatives to her Government’s Brexit plan.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

SIC has a poor record of flag flying in my opinion from the senior flagstaff. It#s the UK government#sand Scottish Parliaments policy to encourage councils to fly the Union Flagon a regular daily basis. It#s very rare to see a flag flying any time except on the Lord Lieutenants flag flying days list ofwhich is out of date.It is troubling to hear where the British media still blame German militarism and nationalism for WW, asnationalism and militarism were ever missing from the British national outlook. All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour. It seems most of our neighbours still see it that way, as something worthwhile which tempers selfish instincts and secures peace.If Brexit goes ahead the prospect of Britain forgetting its responsibilities as a victor, as Churchill put it in, #for the immediate future of the world# looms large. Let us hope some lessons can be recalled.#Patriotism is when the love of your own people comes first nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.# # Charles de GaulleSadly we see Donald Trump, #America First!, Let#s make America great again#. A nationalist doctrine of utter selfishness!We seem the same doctrine of the Alt-right gaining a foothold in the UK and Europe. Remember #The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing#,It is a sad reflection of the many, many people which has died due to war and conflict.There is one institute which promotes, encourages and sanctions war and conflict more so than any other establishment within a modern society.We have probably killed and maimed more people in the last  years than at any other time in  years. What has brought this to the fore is technology but also the institutes which have remained silent on such atrocities, this being the backbone of modern societies driven by economics, our banking systems.Never has there been so much money spent on war and conflict, never have so many countries been destroyed by war and conflict, and who stands by the sideline reaping in massive profits as a result, our banks.The Bible says # For the Love of Money is the Root to All Evils # never a truer word said with our modern banking systems.Rather sad that at a time when we remember those that saw the horror of so many European conflicts, we also saw the French and German leaders announce they want to create a #real# EU Army. I presume by #real# they mean, #the ability to kill people#. Not only was it tactless of Merkel and Macron, we surely have enough standing armed forces already in the world. Do we really need another Jane , I feel sure that Merkel and Macron were not thinking along the same lines as yourself .They stated the need for a ‘ real army’without any references to the huge revenues that could be gained from the manufacture of arms.It’s all very well trying to pass their claim off as being for the strength and safety of Europe but with no reference whatsoever to the economic   financial benefits which would bolster the banking strengths of Germany and France. What an oversight !!Too much sauerkraut and champagne probablyto blame.I wondertheir suggestion is in any way due to their much reduced popularity in their respective countries.I would have thought the present EU decision-making structure e.g. nations’ vetoes, is hopelessly incompatible with having its own military, capable of defending Europe against Russia, China and laughably, the US. How much will that cost  It will need massive further integration, possibly, to United States of Europe level , a ghastly spectre that motivated many Brexiteers to vote ‘Leave’. year more than the next seven countries put together at  billion dollars.To say that the E.U. should not work militarily together is preposterous.Europe has been ided by maniacs with delusions of grandeur,their own ego#s and agendas on too many occasions # the last fty years has brought us peace,economic stability and a continent able to feed itself.I am sure WinstonChurchillwould be very proud of that after the hell of World ,he fought like so many others for it and would be appalled at the prospect of Little Englanderism and the new Westminster faith with its no deal brexit nonsense! Hungarian Revolution of , Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, The Bosnian War, The Kosovo War, Annexation of Crimea, The Ukraine crisis, The Russo-Georgian War and that is ignoring The Troubles in Ireland and countless terrorist attacks. We have a death toll here of tens of thousand and rising! Graham Fleming at least make a stab at historical fact occasionally.John, look at the EU command structure! The most expensive army on Earth would require a  Sate agreement before it could deploy. Then it could not fire a shot. If it hit an killed an enemy how about that enemy#s human rights  Iy takes # The Europen Court # about four years to reach a design!Thank God we are not talking about a European Navy, climate change and all that, sailing ships only.All of these good things I mentioned happened within our European Union,the bad bit you mentioned truthfully# was Northern Ireland, mainly the domain and remit of the British state doesn#t bode well for the future at all,at all.Interesting that the Great War commemoration coincides with Theresa May#s abject surrender to the EU.One big threat from May#s deal is to the UK union itself with the proposal that Northern Ireland be separated from the rest of the UK and be under Brussels laws and regulations.As predicted, the SNP now want the same treatment and will use that as a #grievance# to win support for a second Scottish independence referendum.The current mess will also play straight into their hands by confirming their allegations of #Westminster incompetence#.How on earth could anyone accuse the Westminster government of incompetence Many events over the past four years that have commemorated the sacrice of so many people have been profoundly moving .However I have been a bit upset this year.I have noticedthat local communities were trying to #outdo# each other with their poppydisplays.Well-meant I am sure, but remembrance is not about community #one-up-man-ship#, it is very personal and I am sad that in some places it has been turned into a #best display# competition # a Halloween of who can remember best.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Thursday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated. Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all. It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it.

not the pound.m which Councillor Bruce has claimed.\"HIE also acquired pound.m in preference shares.\"However, due in large part to delay, obfuscation and obstruction by the previous administration of Highland Council, planning permissions were still not able to be delivered after  frustrating years of trying.\"As a result, and to the intense dismay and signicant financial cost of the three partners involved, the scheme, which would have created hundreds of much-needed jobs locally in an area of the country which desperately needed them, was forced into administration.\"This obviously meant the loss of pound.m of public money, which was utterly lamentable and deeply regrettable, as well as millions of pounds of losses to the three partners involved, but it also delayed huge investment in the local economy.\"It was only because Macdonald Hotels had a rock-solid commitment to regenerating the resort that we reached an agreement with the administrators in June  which prevented it from closing down completely for a second time.\"Ironically, it was only after the administration process that Highland Council granted the planning permission which had been applied for  years previously and which two previous owners had walked away from during that time.\"There was nothing controversial within that planning permission and itrsquos no more than the design of the resort as it is today.\"Since then we have invested pound.m in transforming the infrastructure at Aviemore and are now the largest private-sector employer in the area, with hundreds of full and part time staff employed there and an annual wage bill of pound.m.\"\"Indeed, we estimate that the resort will have hosted over , overnight stays, including several international conferences ndash some of them with up to  delegates -

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway.

He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age.

While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year.

It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed.

In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8700094.1541778907!/image/image.jpg","title":"local mum hails go for it programme after she achieves life goal of opening her own business","story":"Helen McBurney from Ballymena explained that she always had an interested in beauty and owning her own business was a le goal. with Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre.

Sinn Fein Councillor Patrice Hardy brought forward a motion as last weeks full council meeting, which stated: This Council supports the Right to Work: Right to Welfare groups Peoples Proposal aimed at introducing a simple but vital checklist for social security decision makers.‘This Council supports the aim and will write to the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Communities for the issuance of guidance to all Decision Makers, requiring them to ensure that both due process and impact assessments are undertaken and fully compiled with in the decision making process.Speaking in support of the motion, Councillor Hardy said: For me this is about protecting the most vulnerable in our society.“It is about building protections for the many citizens in the Mid and East Antrim Council district who are in the receipt of benefits. The Right to Welfare Group are calling for a risk assessment to be carried out by social security decision makers and have developed the Peoples Proposal which is a human rights checklist. “The checklist includes the right to due process, including the right to information and representation, presumption of innocence and transparent decision making prior to the appeal stage.”Councillor Hardy spoke passionate about the Peoples Proposal and about the recent benefit changes.She said it is needed because: On average over  financial sanction are issued against unemployed people every month, while  decisions are made on a monthly basis to stop sickness benefits.People are being financially sanctioned first and then appealed afterwards while suffering forced poverty.She gave figures, saying that: , people were forced to use food banks last year, including , children. This isnt good enough.Speaking about children, she said levels of child poverty have continued to increase here.Over a quarter of all children are living in poverty. This is not just a statistic, this is a sad reality. Many children are arriving to school hungry. Every child should have the right to food and every child should be free from poverty. Seconding the motion, fellow Sinn Fein Councillor James McKeown, said: This highlights the disaster that is austerity and changes in the welfare system have brought upon people in our society. He also added: We need a fairer and more professional approach to benefits.UUP Councillor Stephen Nicholl, said: The substance of the motion is absolutely correct. The impact of the changes in welfare delivery are causing a signicant impact in society, especially on those who are the poorest in society.He added: The increasing use of food banks in areas where universal credit has been ruled out, the use of food banks have increased by %.I have seen some horrendous decisions going through. So I think anything that introduces greater clarity and greater consideration of the actualconditions is to be welcomed to try and make this a fairer system.DUP Councillor Billy Ashe said this affected everyone. He commented: We would support this motion. The benefit system is not working for the most vulnerable.He added that the community planning directorate compile a report on this subject that Council can use to influence decision making at a higher level in the future.Council unanimously voted in support of the motion.

After an introduction to the abattoir, the group was given a comprehensive tour of the kill floor and lairage.In the chill area, the group members had the opportunity to see dferent grades of lambs coming through the plant that day. Gary outlined what the ideal lamb is for Linden Foods to allow them to process for their customers’ needs, with discussion on how farmers can market lambs that meet this specication. The group was joined by William Chesneywho explained the grading system and what the grader is looking for when assessing each carcase as the lambs were weighed and graded at the scale, prior to entering the chill.William and Gary both reinforced the importance of weighing and handling lambs regularly to assess their market readiness. In particular, they emphasised the importance of not allowing lambs to becoming overfat. This not only restricts the potential market outlets, but is uneconomical for the farmer.The farmers were guided through the slaughter area where each stage of the slaughter process was explained. The visit finished with a walk through live lamb reception area where Gary was able to demonstrate the type of live lambs that produce the carcases Linden require for their customers. There was good discussion on the use of electronic identicationand especially feedback to the members on inidual lambs. Members stressed that, where they had invested in electronic readers and on farm software packages using EID to become more efficient, they were not receiving enough feedback information from the abattoir. Gary agreed that more information on inidual animals would be of benefit to the farmers. Linden Foods have invested in the hardware and software to allow inidual animal feedback to farmers linked to tag numbers and are keen to develop put this service in place for suppliers.The group members were impressed by the skill or the operators on the slaughter and processing lines and the efficiency of the overall processing system. The high level of animal welfare standards demonstrated was impressive in such a busy but efficient working environment.

Playing over  characters between them, Jo and Marty are still being stopped by fans eager to catch another viewing of the production such was its success during a run at the Roddy’s in August.“We wanted to bring the play back as we have such a successful relationship with the Balmoral Hotel, especially in the run-up to Christmas,” explained Brassneck Director Tony Devlin. “This will be the fourth production we have brought to the hotel. There has been huge demand for aof the show, as a lot of people didn’t get a chance to catch it first time around. We thought it was the next natural step to bring it to the Balmoral.”Jo spoke of how from the first night the play was staged “we soon realised very quickly that this was something special.”“The audience response was incredible after opening night,” she said. “People are still stopping us saying ‘When are you coming back, when are you coming back ’”“I think it’s a perfect way to finish the year especially after all the celebrations for Féile,” explained Marty. “One of the loveliest things was the audience reaction we got when we travelled to Coalisland. The audience there, who might not have been all that familiar with the beginnings of Féile, gave us a standing ovation, they were bowled over by the Féile story. To have a Christmas slant on it is just the icing on the cake. The performances in December will be a chance to raise a glass and tip the hat to all the people who created the festival combined with the celebration of Christmas,” he said.“The play starts with our two protagonists waiting to get into heaven, it will be a nice Christmas gt to find outFra or Bridie get into heaven or end up in limbo in Larne,” he laughed. A Christmas Station Once Again will be performed at the Balmoral Hotel from December  to  at pm. Tickets are priced at £ and are available from the hotel or by telephoning  .

I am not doing the work here for the students to recognise me in that way, I teach because I love it but it was such a great boost. I came into the classroom so happy and delighted to share the news with the class,” she said.Alanah spoke of the importance of young teachers making their mark in the city especially with so many who are choosing to go across the water or travel further afield.“Loads of my friends have left and gone to Liverpool, places like Qatar. I’m very much a home bird, I love being here, teaching here but I ask myself the question what does going across to Liverpool to teach have that we don’t have here at home  How are we supposed to make young lives betterwe leave and take our skills where “There is a young teaching staff in the Religion department here and our big focus is very much on ethics, making the subject more relevant to the pupils’ lives, how do you live out your faith through action  The girls I teach are so kind, there is a real kindness about our pupils, they would offer you the food from their lunch boxes, they are just so, so caring. At the minute our ‘Mini Marillacs’ named after St Louise, are collecting for the homeless and I would put a big emphasis on helping those less fortunate and the girls would bring in hats, gloves, scarfs, toiletries which are then brought to the Legion of Mary for distribution.”“Our sixth years go up to St John’s residential home every Tuesday to make cups of tea, bring buns and biscuits for the elderly.

These pressures have left many of our members on the verge of quitting their jobs. This is an intolerable situation for the NASUWT, we are committed to defending the rights of our members in this school and hope that a constructive engagement can begin soon with the employers to fully address the situation.”A spokesperson for the CCMS, which oversees St Patrick#s said: “CCMS fully appreciates the right of teachers to take industrial action. However, we do not believe that in this instance such action is either proportionate or warranted. It is our firm belief that the issues at the heart of this dispute can best be dealt with through an open and honest dialogue which seeks to provide balance to the concerns of both sides.“CCMS echoes the Board of Governors in its call for a suspension to the proposed industrial action in order to create the time and space for meaningful and respectful dialogue aimed at resolving the issues of concern and dispute.”"},{"url":null,"title":"can you help photographer identify these belfast characters","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Stormont Assembly members paid £.m despite suspension  Government faces rude awakening on Brexit deal, warns DUP  Alex Kane: Theresa May knew the anger her deal would provoke, but went ahead with it anyway... that should worry unionists more than anything  The report said that no new regulatory barriers would be allowed between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK without the permission of Stormont.The proposal was not mentioned in Mrs Mays draft withdrawal agreement, unveiled last week. Stormont collapsed in January  following the resignation of deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness over the RHI Scandal and equality issues.Subsequent attempts at reestablishing the institutions have proved unsuccesful. Speaking at Prime Ministers Questions on Wednesday Mr Dodds asked why the provision was not included in the draft withdrawal agreement.\"Why has the Prime Minister deleted all reference to that in the withdrawal agreement, did she push the delete button ,\" the North Belfast MP said. The Prime Minister said that Mr Dodds was \"absolutely right\" about the December agreement.\"The issue of what the processes would be within the UK to look at this issue of regulations is a matter that will be a matter for this United Kingdom to determine. To determine both our parliamentary rules and our parliamentary decisions on that and indeed the Stormont lock which was expressed in the December joint report,\" Mrs May replied.\" title\"Prime Minister Theresa May speaks during Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"Prime Minister Theresa May speaks during Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons \" width\"\" \"\"  Prime Minister Theresa May speaks during Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons \"Of course, as the Rt Hon gentlemanwill also know, the lock that was in the December joint report referred to a decision being taken by the Northern Ireland Executive and Northern Ireland Assembly, which sadly we do not have in place today.\" Brexit dominated the discussion on Wednesday as the Prime Minister prepares to head to Brussels for talks with the EU on her draft withdrawal deal. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the withdrawal agreement did not cover the cost of extending the transition under the Northern Ireland backstop.\"In February, the Prime Minister said that creating a customs and regulatory down the Irish Sea is something that no UK Prime Minister could ever agree to, can the Prime Minister explain why the backstop agreement would create exactly that border,\" Mr Corbyn said.Mrs May argued that she had secured concessions from the EU in her deal.\"It would not create exactly that, from February until the last few weeks the EU said that the only answer was a Northern Ireland customs territory, we argued and we resisted and we made clear that we would not accept the position of the EU and a few weeks ago they agreed with our position, they conceded to the UK so that there will not be a customs border down the Irish Sea,\" the PM said.Mrs May accused the Labour leader of not reading or understanding the withdrawal agreement after he admitted at the weekend he hadnt read it all.\"There is an entire protocol in the withdrawal agreement setting out regulations that apply only to Northern Ireland, she clearly didnt discuss this draft agreement with the DUP, because their Brexit spokespersonsaid we are clear, we will not be voting for this humiliation,\" the Labour leader fired back. \"It fails the Prime Ministers red lines, fails Labours six tests, and it fails to impress the new Northern Ireland minister , who just hours before he was appointed said the deal is dead.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland business owner with 300 employees opposes deal says","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Business groups, including national business group CBI, small business group the FSB, and the Ulster Farmers Union have given their backing to Theresa Mays draft Brexit deal - something which has drawn the ire of the DUP. DUP East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson told the News Letter the groups were being used as \"puppets\". Speaking to the BBC on Wednesday evening Mrs Foster said: \"First of all a section of the business community has come out in favour of this deal, and there are many in the business community who are not in favour of this deal.

I have met with a gentleman who runs a business with  people employed, £m of turnover, and hes absolutely outraged by the suggestion this deal should come in.\"Mrs Foster said it was a bad deal as it will put \"more cost\" and \"more regulation\" on businesses in Northern Ireland. Pushed on whether the business man would be speaking publicly, Mrs Foster said the press will \"hear from him and you will hear from many others as well\". She added it was important to listen to \"a wide range of businesses and not just those businesses who find time to go along with the CBI and FSB\". \"There are many businesses in Northern Ireland who don’t have time to engage in those activities but who have a very clear view of this withdrawal agreement,\" she said. Mrs Foster confirmed the confidence-and-supply agreement with the Conservative Government was still in place and that the agreement is \"not just about money, it’s about making sure the union is secure\".Theresa May is set to meet with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker to discuss the political declaration on the future EU-UK relations, with attempts to remove her from office by hard Brexiters having abated.

For decades this has held back our economy and created deeper disparity between east-west investment,\" said Ms Bradley.Appearing before the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee on Wednesday, Mr Paisley asked the Secretary of Stateshe would consider a feasibility study into a bridge between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Bridge from Northern Ireland to Scotland is a serious idea, says professor\"Weve seen ingenuity in engineering skills with the  mile bridge being built between one part of mainland China and one of the islands off China,\" said Mr Paisley, noting a link between Northern Ireland and Scotland covers a stretch of  miles. \"I think anyone who visits the Causeway coast will always be struck by just how close Scotland is to Northern Ireland,\" responded Mrs Bradley, noting there are issues around the sea bed and current on the proposed site of the bridge link Mrs Bradley said she was open to holding a meeting with representatives from Northern Ireland about the bridge. Branding Mr Paisleys request the \"political not the practical\", the SDLPs Sinead Bradley said: “People are literally dying on our roads, yet the DUP in their ‘wisdom’ are obsessing over a bridge from Northern Ireland to Scotland. \"It beggars belief that we cannot build a m bridge from Warrenpoint to Omeath, but yet the Secretary of State has agreed to discuss a feasibility study for a bridge to Scotland.“As political deadlock continues and our chronic infrastructure systems moves from bad to worse, it is bordering on offensive that the DUP would continue to push a pipe dream based on political aspirations rather than serve the people of Northern Ireland.”DUP leader Arlene Foster and MP Sammy Wilson have both previously voiced their support for the project. The catalyst for the bridge idea originally came from a speech made by former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in January , in which he floated the idea of a -mile bridge across the English Channel to France - something he said would improve transport links after Brexit.Professor Alan Dunlop, one of the UKs leading architects, was asked by newspaper in Scotland to produce plans for a potential bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland. He laid out two proposals for the route - one from Larne and Portpatrickor a crossing between the Mull of Kintyrne and Torr Head .An artists impression of the bridge was released in September.

And, as a result we have given sufficient direction to our negotiators, I hope, for them to be able to resolve the remaining issues.“And that work will start immediately.“I now plan tofor further meetings, including with President Juncker on Saturday to discuss how we can bring to a conclusion this process and bring it to a conclusion in the interests of all our people.”The remarks came after suggestions from Brussels that the summit set to approve the draft withdrawal agreement on Sunday could be called off unless progress is made on finalising a political declaration on future relations, with one senior official saying: “We’re not there yet.”Reports suggested that Germany’s ambassador to the EU had said the document must be finalised by Thursday or Chancellor Angela Merkel would not attend.Asked whether the UK expected the summit to go ahead, the PM’s official spokesman said only: “A summit has been called, an agenda has been published and we look forward to attending.”As talks went down to the wire, Chancellor Philip Hammond said thatthe Brexit deal is rejected by Parliament it would unleash ‘political chaos’ and could lead to EU withdrawal not happening.He told ITV’s Peston: “It’s clear thatthe deal is not approved by Parliament we will have a politically chaotic situation.“And, we don’t know what the outcome of that will be.“And for those who are passionately committed to ensuring that we leave the EU on the th of March, , one of the things that they are going to have to bear in mind is the possibility that in that chaos that would ensue there may be no Brexit.”He added: “It could be no deal, but it could be no Brexit, we just don’t know.“When we look at the economy, and the operation of the economy, getting a smooth exit from the European Union, doing this in an orderly fashion, is worth tens of billions of pounds to our economy.”In other obstacles for Mrs May, Spain has raised concerns about the treatment of Gibraltar in the proposed text, while France is understood to be pushing for better rights of access to UK fishing waters.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said his government is “annoyed” that the orce agreement being prepared for Britain’s exit from the European Union doesn’t specy that Gibraltar’s future must be decided directly by officials in Madrid and London.Mr Sanchez said the issue is a bilateral matter and is “essential” for Spain.He repeated his threat that Spain will vote against the planned agreement unless its interests are taken into account.And Mrs Merkel set her face against Tory backbench demands for Britain to have the unilateral power to tear up a proposed “backstop” arrangement for the Irish border.Mrs Merkel told the German Parliament: “We have placed value, and I think this is right, on the fact that Britain cannot decide unilaterally when it ends the state of the customs union, but that Britain must decide this together with the EU.”Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis said that for Sunday’s summit to go ahead, “we will need to have agreed beforehand the political declaration on the future relationship and we are not there yet”.He added: “Sherpas are due to meet on Friday. They will need to see a final text before then, and the Commission stands ready to consider the text and take any action at any time.”Since unveiling her draft agreement last week, the PM has repeatedly warned MPs that failure to approve it would risk a no-deal Brexit, or no Brexit at all.But answering questions in the Commons on Wednesday, she told MPs that the alternative to her deal “will either be more uncertainty, more ision, or it could risk no Brexit at all”.Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “It is my view that the House of Commons will stop no-deal.“There isn’t a majority in the House of Commons to allow that to take place.”The minister, a former Remain campaigner who replaced Leave-backing Esther McVey in the Cabinet following her resignation last week, said she expected MPs to back Mrs May’s plan after peering into the “abyss” and pulling back.But she added: “If it doesn’t get through, anything could happen.“The Brexiteers may lose their Brexit.”"},{"url":null,"title":"meghans first thanksgiving as member of the royal family","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

been given to Carryduff girl Cara Mailey.The nine-year-old has a form of dwarfism which means that living in a standard-sized world can present challenges for her.Born with achonlasia, Cara dared to dream big and applied last year to have a special den created for her by the team from the popular CBBC programme The Dengineers.The plucky and determined child is now the proud owner of a colourful sweet-themed garden den that is ideally sized to suit her height mdash and her sweet tooth.Despite the production team swamping the Mailey family home in June to carry out the work, the show was only broadcast on Sunday morning.Cara found herself a star attraction at St Josephrsquos Primary School, in Carryduff on Monday.ldquoA lot of people have been telling me I saw you in the newspaper, I saw you on TV, giggled Cara.She has made great use of her den since then.ldquoI play in it most of the time, I sometimes do my homework there and bring in my friends to play or go in just get some sweets and bring them into the house, she told the Recorder.ldquoHaving the den makes me feel a lot happier and safer as usually I would be climbing up stuff to reach things but now I can pick them up and

never had anything like it when I was younger, she said. For Cara all of the toys or bikes for her age group are all too big or tall for her, so this is brilliant.Mrs Mailey said Cara came up with the idea of having a sweet-themed den after attending a birthday party at Aunt Sandrarsquos Candy Factory in Belfast last year.ldquoCara decided herself that she wanted to apply for the Dengineers and I honestly didnrsquot think she had any chance of getting it as there were over , applications from throughout the UK, said Trish.ldquoCara did a phone interview with the producers, then a Skype interview, then they came over to spend a day with her and it was all hush hush until we got the call to say she had got it.Her parents had to keep the news a secret until presenters Lauren Layfield and Joe Traconi surprised her with the news in May after she won bronze in the m sprint at the National Dwarf Games in Birmingham.Trish added: ldquoA team of four came over in June on a Monday as the den was created by designer Mara Tulip and the big reveal day on the Friday.

Despite their objections, the Housing Executive look set to apply for a vesting order.The main opposition came from disgruntled Shore Street residents who claim that, with the aid of rehabilitation grants, their homes could avoid the chop.Some  new dwellings are to be built, providing accommodation for nearly  people in a iety of house types, both two and single storey.The Housing Executive have guaranteed that any of the existing residents who want to move back to the site on which they are now living will be given first option on that house.This means that all the  families in the area at present will be accommodated in a new house on, or very close to, their present location.However, many residents were not convinced that the Housing Executiversquos plans were what was really required.Mr Marks, who owns a house in Shore Street, told officials that, at present, he has the luxury of a garage and garden at his home.ldquoIf the property is vested I will have nothing at all, he said. ldquoNo matter how well I am reimbursed there is still no way I can afford another house that would cost in the region of pound,.DOWNPATRICK mdash The headmaster of Down High School, Mr J E Buckley, has hit out at the ldquononsense talk surrounding many of todayrsquos educational problems and stressed that ldquobright ideas usually only help one pupil at the expense of another.In his annual report to the school, he warned that there can be no universal solution to educational problems because methods which are effective with one child may oe completely ineffective with another.Mr Buckley said that in Down High a ldquocautious attitude had been adopted towards new methods.NEWCASTLE mdash A unanimous decision to keep alive the efforts of Newcastle Town Committee was recorded at a specially reconvened public meeting last week.A resounding vote of confidence was passed by over  residents and local business people who attended the meeting at the Slieve Donard Hotel in response to an appeal by the committee.The future of the town committee was plunged into question at the annual meeting in September when only a handful of people bothered to attend.In a do or die effort it was decided to hold a further meeting to ascertain whether the people of Newcastle felt the need to maintain a town committee or not.Mr Bill Martin, past chairman, said the town committee had ben there driving force behind the upsurge in the development of the town and to let it die now would knock the resort back into the doldrums.Mrs Hugh Davey felt that there were far too many committees in Newcastle, all striving towards the same end.Mr Colman Hanna suggested the town committee could adopt the role of a co-ordinating group for all committees in the town.Councillor Norman Bicker was of the opinion that the committee should seek a new image. ldquoIt would appear that the town committee is trying to do too much and perhaps be more profitably engaged in organising only three or four events, he said.Many local business people at the meeting said they had no hesitation in financing the committeersquos efforts and would continue to support the activities in the future.BALLYNAHINCH mdash A  year-old Ballynahinch girl whose Christmas Eve turned to tragedy when she was injured in an accident was awarded pound, damages in the High Court.Veronica Lynn, of Windmill Gardens, was struck down by a car on her way to a dance and as a result she suffered severe head and leg injuries.The court also heard that after the accident she was unconscious for three weeks and could not speak for another month.CROSSGAR mdashBreadman Alec Holmes is looking forward to a well-deserved retirement at his Crossgar Road home.With an army gratuity payment of pound, le savings of pound and a pound loan, Alec bought over the bread delivery round of Carsons, a Belfast-based firm,  years ago.His route never changed over the years and each day he could be found doing the Crossgar, Shrigley, Killyleagh, Downpatrick, Dundrum, Annalong and Kilkeel run.Over the years Aled has seen tremendous changes in the bread business. ldquoBack in  a loaf of bread cost four old pence and soda bread sold at a penny, Alec said.ldquoMy first weekrsquos salary was the princely sum of pound and, believe me, I wasnrsquot doing too badly.

It is also impacting on residents being able to park outside their homes, particularly in the Irish Street, Fountain Street and Saul Street areas.Cllr Sharvin believes the combined voices of the business community and residents can see the charges reduced to their previous level to ldquosupport the economical sustainability of Downpatrick town centre.He is also encouraging people to complete the online survey or pick up a paper copy from the council offices at the Downshire Civic Centre.Cllr Sharvin confirmed he has also asked council officials to survey the condition of its three car parks in Downpatrick, suggesting the surface in Irish Street is ldquoparticularly poor.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has also expressed concern about the impact of the increased charges and believes the increasing concern is exactly the kind of issue a tradersrsquo group in the town should be addressing.He added: ldquoThe town needs a thriving business organisation to help with its continued economic regeneration and to discuss issues like increased parking charges. Such a body would provide the business community with a much-needed voice on a range of important issues.The series of roadshows to discuss parking charges moved to The Lodge in Castlewellan and the Newcastle Centre last night and takes place next Tuesday, November , at Ballynahinchrsquos Market House between .pm and .pm, before later moving to The Hub in Saintfield between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Symbolic lantern walk rekindles time WWI ended  ","story":"A SPECIALLY designed beacon was lit in Killyleagh on Sunday night to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.Local man Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, , one of Northern Irelandrsquos last survivors from the Second World War, lit the gas beacon of light at the front of Killyleagh Castle to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent.Mr Charters was accompanied by two local schoolchildren, Zac Gordon, from St Maryrsquos Primary School, Killyleagh, and Louise Craig, of Killyleagh Integrated Primary School.The cross-community event was attended by more than  people at the end of Remembrance Sunday.The eveningrsquos events began with a lantern walk from Shrigley to Killyleagh.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

TUV leader Jim Allister said business leaders havent appreciated the long-term implications of the Brexit dealNorth Antrim MLA Mr Allister has been equally critical of business leaders for backing the accord, and yesterday warned that the backstop,triggered, would destroy NI’s economy.He said: “With £.bn of goods flowing annually from GB to NI, why do our business leaders think it is better to prioritise the £bn which comes from the ROI and ensure for them frictionless entry at the price of a regulatory border for the far greater volume that comes from GB “The attempted answer that the Brexit deal gives us the best of both worlds is a lie, because it only allows frictionless trade to GB, but not from GB. “Yet, such trade is vital to our supply chain and is what fills our supermarket shelves and for farmers what supplies most of our feedstuff ingredients, fuel and fertilisers. “Thus the rush to embrace a crippling Irish Sea border is as absurd as it is destructive of our economy.” Mr Allister accused those who support the deal of “failing to appreciate” the long-term implications of legally making Northern Ireland, alone within the UK, part of the EU customs territory.He added: “This is a staggering dereliction of duty by business leaders, aided by a ‘look the other way’ approach by most business journalists who have abandoned all objectivity to clamber on board the anti-Brexit bandwagon.“It will be too late for business to waken up when we are a semi-detached part of our all important UK single market and the free flow of goods is impeded to NI from GB and EU tarfs strangle our imports.”Santa Claus crisis ... there’s no snow in LaplandMurder accused extradited from Republic fails in bail bid Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Our new security provider, Wilson James, took over this contact on  November and have an ongoing recruitment drive with  vacancies currently available at enhanced rates of pay. “We are working hard behind the scenes to try to resolve these issues as quickly as possible but the recruitment, training and security clearance of staff will take time to implement. “We would ask all our passengers to arrive two hours before their flight and fully prepared for the security search process as this will speed up processing times for everyone.”A spokesperson for Wilson James said: “Wilson James took over the security contract at Belfast International Airport on  November .“Wilson James inherited a staffing shortage from the previous provider which has continued to impact the service delivery. However, we are pleased to confirm that the recruitment process for  employees is already under way and candidates are moving through a rigorous security vetting process to ensure that aviation security standards are maintained.“To complement our recruitment strategy, we are also pleased to confirm that last week we agreed an improved pay deal which will raise pay rates across the whole the security contract. “We are confident that this priority on our employees will deliver a higher calibre of service and provide passengers a more seamless journey through the airport.

ICTS said it had provided an “excellent service” and claimed the inadequate service provided to customers over the summer months was beyond its control.Meanwhile, George Best Belfast City Airport, which has officially opened upgraded terminal facilities following a £ million infrastructure investment, says its new security search area has reduced average queuing times to just six minutes.• See Morning View in tomorrow’s News Lettertry catch     .               ..

the Prince of Wales. Photo: Yui Mok PA WireOn Saturday, Best captained Ireland in their hard-fought - win over New Zealand at Dublin’s Aviva Stadium – widely regarded as one of Ireland’s greatest results of all time.The euphoria had barely died down before the Craigavon-born British and Irish Lion was back in the limelight for what he has described as his greatest inidual accolade to date. “You play rugby because you love it and then all of a sudden you get these awards, but I think of all the inidual awards I’ve received in my career this is certainly the highest,” he said.Best’s father John was previously honoured with a MBE for services to agriculture, while his mother Patricia was also recognised with an MBE for services to the public sector.Best said:“I suppose they can’t really believe it. When I first told my family they were shocked but absolutely delighted – it means a lot to our family, especially with mum and dad having received MBEs.“It’s a lovely family celebration.”In more than  years of trying the Irish beat the All Blacks for the first time, also under Best’s captaincy, in Chicago in November .In a glittering career he has made  appearances for Ulster, been capped  times by Ireland and won four Six Nations titles – including two grand slams.Speaking following the announcement of his OBE award in June this year, Best said: “To be recognised for contributing to a sport, for someone to feel I’m worthy of being nominated, and then to be deemed worthy, it’s quite incredible.“My parents were obviously delighted. My mum and dad actually both have MBEs...so it was quite funny telling them I’d gone one better than them.” Best became the first Ulster player to reach  caps for Ireland when he helped the men in green overcome Australia - in Dublin in November . grills Secretary of State Karen Bradleyat the NI Affairs Committee\"   grills Secretary of State Karen Bradleyat the NI Affairs Committee\"  Brexit deal ‘will give Dublin authority over NI affairs’Santa Claus crisis ... there’s no snow in Lapland Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"At the same investiture ceremony, actor Hugh Laurie was awarded a CBE for services to drama.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

An initial pre-application notice was issued for the scheme last year, but now the developer behind the scheme – Neptune Carleton – has submitted an outline planning application for the ambitious project. If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor. The steak restaurant now has nine locations in the UK, and focuses on dry-aged beef and all that comes with it.A Sunday lunch of rich, pink rump of beef comes with a Yorkshire pudding, stunningly crunchy roasties and a roasted bulb of garlic, and shallot – leaving them soft and packed full of umami.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates.
