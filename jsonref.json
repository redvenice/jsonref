By the time Meghan had become a senior royal, the pair were still no closer than before the 2018. According to one source, Meghan was disappointed that they hadn\u0027t bonded, but was not losing sleep over it.    The book also details one awkward moment at Kensington Palace in 2017 when Kate went alone in her Range Rover while shopping - despite  the fact Meghan was also going to the same street. Though some aides claimed the sisters-in-law \u0027talked and texted regularly\u0027, they had barely spent any time together by the time of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding.  The book also reveals how Meghan regarded some commentary and tabloid stories as \u0027sexist\u0027 and \u0027prejudiced\u0027, with ambitious women of colour like her labelled \u0027demanding and aggressive\u0027.  A close friend of Meghan\u0027s told the authors: \u0027Duchess Different. That\u0027s what people have a problem with.

Judges chaired by publisher Margaret Busby said that Mantel’s “masterful exhibition of sly dialogue and exquisite description brings the Tudor world alive”.The novelist, who won the Booker for the two previous novels in her trilogy, Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies, is one of only four authors to win the prestigious award twice, alongside Margaret Atwood, Peter Carey and JM Coetzee. No writer has yet won three times.Mantel has said that while “it will be cast in terms of a disaster if I don’t win it again”, she would not perceive it as a snub if she lost.The Mirror and The Light\u0026nbspby Hilary Mantel (UK)\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRedhead by The Side of the Road\u0026nbspby Anne Tyler (US)\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLove and Other Thought Experiments\u0026nbspby Sophie Ward (UK)\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHow Much of These Hills is Gold\u0026nbspby C Pam Zhang (US)\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOn a longlist packed with surprises and debuts, chosen from 162 novels, Mantel is up against major literary names including US author Anne Tyler, picked for Redhead by the Side of the Road, a work judges called “a very human tale of redemption”, as well as the Irish-American author Colum McCann, longlisted for Apeirogon, about a Palestinian and an Israeli, both of whom have lost their daughters.Award-winning Zimbabwean author Tsitsi Dangarembga is in the running for This Mournable Body, a sequel to her 1988 novel Nervous Conditions, named by the BBC as one of the 100 books that shaped the world. Judges said This Mournable Body “drew an immediate reaction like a sharp intake of breath from all of us on the panel”. Ethiopian-American author Maaza Mengiste is nominated for her second novel The Shadow King, set during Italy’s 1935 invasion of Ethiopia and praised by judges as “a brave, noble, gripping book that would not have been written at any other point in history”.New novels by established writers, including Maggie O’Farrell, Curtis Sittenfeld, David Mitchell, Ali Smith, Marilynne Robinson and Ben Lerner, all failed to make the cut. Instead, judges plumped for eight debuts, including Kiley Reid’s Such a Fun Age, which opens as a black woman is accused of kidnapping the white girl she’s babysitting, and C Pam Zhang’s How Much of These Hills Is Gold, in which two Chinese children try to survive in the 19th-century American west after their impoverished parents die.Other debuts include Real Life by US author Brandon Taylor, following a black, queer, introverted man from Alabama, which was described by judges as “a deeply painful, nuanced account of microaggressions, abuse, racism, homophobia, trauma, grief and alienation”. Avni Doshi’s Burnt Sugar, in which an Indian woman recalls her childhood neglect as her elderly mother’s memory begins to fade, was praised as “utterly compelling”. And Scottish-American author Douglas Stuart’s Shuggie Bain, following one boy’s childhood in Glasgow public housing in the 1980s, was called “an amazingly intimate, compassionate, gripping portrait of addiction, courage and love”.Independent press Oneworld, which won two consecutive Booker prizes with Marlon James’s A Brief History of Seven Killings and Paul Beatty’s The Sellout, also makes the cut this year for Diane Cook’s The New Wilderness, the short-story writer’s first novel. Following a mother who moves away from a polluted metropolis with her young daughter in order to take part in a radical experiment in the dangerous “Wilderness”, the judges called it a “wonderfully imagined … tense future-shock novel”.Gaby Wood, literary director of the Booker Prize Foundation, said that even the judges had been startled by the number of debuts.“It is an unusually high proportion, and especially surprising to the judges themselves, who had admired many books by more established authors, and regretted having to let them go,” said Wood. “It is perhaps obvious that powerful stories can come from unexpected places and in unfamiliar forms nevertheless, this kaleidoscopic list serves as a reminder.”Six years after the Booker prize decided to open its doors to any writer writing in English and published in the UK, prompting widespread concerns about the potential dominance of US novelists, nine of the 13 writers up for this year’s award are either American or have dual US heritage.Just three are from the UK alone: Mantel and debut novelists Gabriel Krauze and Sophie Ward. Krauze explores violence and vengeance in London in Who They Was, while Ward’s Love and Other Thought Experiments tells of the couple Rachel and Eliza, in a work judges described as “an extremely original, genre-bending novel that melds Anglo-American analytical philosophy with realist social drama and futuristic science fiction”.Busby, whose judging panel includes thriller writer Lee Child, poet Lemn Sissay, critic Sameer Rahim and classicist Emily Wilson, said that each of the 13 novels selected by judges “carries an impact that has earned it a place on the longlist”.“There are voices from minorities often unheard, stories that are fresh, bold and absorbing. The best fiction enables the reader to relate to other people’s lives sharing experiences that we could not ourselves have imagined is as powerful as being able to identify with characters,” she said, describing the combination of new and established authors as “a truly satisfying outcome”.A shortlist of six books will be unveiled on 15 September, with the winner announced in November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/522e1576721e79edfca701b1a6cdddad06e4013a/0_0_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c11f0d1e476ddb686f2af6f4ae912c1d","title":"amazon plans big expansion of uk online grocery service","story":"Company seeks to capitalise on uplift in demand following Covid-19 lockdown restrictionsAmazon is stepping up its competition with British supermarkets by pressing ahead with the wider UK rollout of its online grocery service by the end of the year.Larger orders on Amazon Fresh will be free to members of the online retailer’s Prime service from Tuesday and will begin to cover more areas in the UK, as the $1.5tn (£1.2tn) company seeks to capitalise on the growth in doorstep deliveries during the coronavirus pandemic.Amid criticisms that the scheme amounts to a “postcode lottery” that many Prime members living outside London and the home counties have been unable to access, the e-commerce giant is also expanding the scheme to cover more areas of the UK and to allow greater take-up by its estimated 15 million members. Amazon Fresh is currently available in just 300 postcodes in and around London.It is understood that Prime members in Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh will be among the first to benefit from a wider rollout by the year end. Last month the Bradford-based supermarket chain Morrisons – which collaborates with Amazon on the US company’s same-day grocery service – said it had more than doubled the number of stores serving Amazon Prime customers to 40.Until now, Amazon Fresh purchases have required a monthly add-on fee of £3.99 or a £2.99 delivery fee (in addition to the annual Prime subscription fee of £79 annually). From Tuesday, orders worth more than £40 requiring two-hour delivery will be free but will cost £3.99 for a one-hour slot. Orders under £40 will cost £3.99 for two-hour delivery and £6.99 for one hour, however. The minimum order value will also be lowered from £40 to £15.In other changes, the service is also being speeded up, with same-day grocery deliveries up to midnight in, initially, more than 40 postcode districts in the south-east guaranteed, provided shoppers order by 9pm.“Prime members love the convenience of grocery delivery at home, which is why we’ve made Amazon Fresh a free benefit of Prime,” said Russell Jones, country manager, Amazon Fresh UK. “Grocery delivery is one of the fastest-growing businesses at Amazon … We will keep improving the grocery shopping experience so by the end of the year, millions of Prime members across the UK will have access to fast, free delivery of groceries.”“They will certainly cause major disruption, ruffle feathers and capture a material slice of the market,” said retail expert Richard Hyman. “Amazon has deep pockets and the massive luxury of not needing to make a profit from food retailing. This is just as well because no one really makes much if any money from online food retailing now. A new kid in town with the immediate muscle of the others, and no need to make money, and the best data-driven logistics in retail has been the incumbents’ nightmare for some time, and it’s about to come true.”One analyst, however, warned that Amazon will have to overcome shoppers’ loyalty to established grocers. “This will not be an easy mountain to climb for Amazon, despite its financial and logistical prowess. Many UK shoppers have a much more emotional bond with food than non-food, and Amazon’s greatest challenge will be in presenting itself as a “go to” destination for food purchases,” said Tom Brereton, associate analyst at GlobalData.Ocado ZoomOnly available to a limited number of postcodes from a small site in west London (second planned for north London).

But an attempt to start mining in the 1980s faltered – the Troubles were raging and authorities feared the IRA would steal any explosives brought into this corner of Northern Ireland.Now, with the Troubles a memory, a New York-based investment fund is planning to build a mine at Greencastle, a hamlet in the Sperrin mountains that sits atop what is by grade one of the world’s biggest unexcavated gold deposits, worth an estimated £3bn.McKenna, a gold sceptic no more, is a community relations manager for the mining company Dalradian Gold, and instead of leprechauns he envisages licences, drilling and jobs. “This is something that has world potential.”Its fate hangs in the balance. The Stormont government announced on 29 June a public inquiry into the application, saying it had received more than 40,000 representations, the vast majority objections.The proposed site at Greencastle is just one of a slew of applications to mine gold in the Dalradian supergroup, a 450-mile belt of rock ning Ireland and Scotland.A surge in global prices – hovering at $1,800 an ounce as investors seek a haven from turbulent markets – may further whet the appetite for Celtic gold on both sides of the North Channel.Commercial extraction of ore at the UK’s only operational gold mine at Cononish near Tyndrum is to start later this year. Cononish is doing geological surveys at two other nearby sites and has exploration licences for 13 parts of the southern Highlands.A second firm, Erris Resources, has begun test sampling at two sites south of Loch Tay in Perthshire that it says have “good prospects” for gold, silver and zinc. Those licences cover hundreds of square kilometres.Other companies have obtained gold prospecting licences for several counties in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, including a site in Clontibret, county Monaghan, said to hold about 500,000 ounces. It is 40 miles south of Greencastle.The Dalradian supergroup was becoming famous for untapped gold, said Richard Gray, the managing director of Scotgold Resources, which owns Cononish. “In the parlance of geologists, it’s elephant country.”The geological formation is named after the Dál Riata, a Gaelic kingdom credited with a golden age of influence in the sixth century. The prospect of mining companies ushering in a literal golden age has polarised opinion in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Some welcome the promise of jobs and investment. Others, including conservationists and environmentalists, fear pollution and despoliation.Politicians and regulators face intense lobbying from both sides. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) is drafting its first mining and quarrying strategy which will cover the water and environmental pollution laws gold mines need to uphold.“We’re clear that environmental compliance is non-negotiable. Every Scottish business will comply with the law, and we’ll work to ensure as many as possible will go even further,” said Kenny Boag, Sepa’s head of strategic regulatory initiatives.Northern Ireland’s infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, said a public inquiry would “robustly scrutinise” the proposed mine at Greencastle.Battle lines have formed for the greatest prize in the Dalradian supergroup. On one side stands Orion Resource Partners, a US investment fund that owns Dalradian Resources, the Canadian parent company of Dalradian Gold.After spending £130m exploring the site it submitted an application for a mine and processing plant in 2017, later revising the application when it dropped plans to use cyanide. The company posits hundreds of jobs, a £750m lift to Northern Ireland’s economy – and clean practices to protect a designated area of outstanding natural beauty.“We’re a first world country with first world standards,” said McKenna. To extract an estimated 3.5m ounces of gold the mine would remove about 1,500 tonnes of rock per day and return about half of it, backfilling tunnels. “Compared internationally it’s a baby, engineers call it a boutique mine,” said McKenna.On the other side stands a group of residents who doubt the promised jobs and fear contamination of air, land and water. They staff the Greencastle People’s Office, a clutch of caravans near the proposed mine which serves as a command centre.“First they’ll blast with explosives and that’ll just be the start. It would wipe out this whole area, it would be toxic,” said John O’Donnell, who fishes trout in rivers.Martin Tracey, 46, a farmer, said damaging dust particles could reach schools and homes close to the site. “If that lodges in the lungs it doesn’t come out again. How much is a human life worth? It’s like someone coming into your house and attacking your family.”The protesters accuse Northern Ireland’s main political parties of ignoring them and question the independence of an inquiry that will sit before the planning appeals commission.The proposed mine has ided the community and sundered friendships, with each side accusing the other of surveillance and intimidation.Instead of gold, the mine may excavate a history of resistance to outsiders that dates back centuries, said Tracey. “We’re well prepared to fight these guys. The pedigree is there. I’m not going to lie down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f361e76a5d1fe02c1fdf3e1fa8607c8339ac85c2/0_70_3726_2235/master/3726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06be0cc7749718242154a5f64ac35ae4","title":"schoolgirls in england have you been informally excluded","story":"We’d like to hear from girls – or their parents – who have been excluded from a school in England via informal methods Girls are being informally excluded at a higher rate than boys from some schools in England, according to a study by not-for-profit group Social Finance.While boys are much more likely to be formally excluded, research shows girls are being excluded through moves to other schools or by leaving one school before the end of year 11 and not finishing their studies elsewhere.

By swimming upstream, they transport nutrients from the oceans and provide food for many land animals, including bears, wolves and birds of prey.The migratory fish are also critical for the food security and livelihoods of millions of people around the world, while recreational fishing is worth billions of dollars a year. The causes of the decline are the hundreds of thousands of dams around the world, overfishing, the climate crisis and water pollution.“For migratory fish, there’s nothing worse than a dam,” said Zeb Hogan, at the University of Nevada and an author of the new report. He said the good news was that fish could return quickly: “Almost without exception, where dams have been removed, you see populations bounce back, often much more quickly than anyone anticipated.”A river restoration completed by the Nature Conservancy in 2016 on the Penobscot River in Maine, US, led to river herring numbers growing from a few hundred to nearly 2m a year. The Dam Removal Europe coalition is working to free the continent’s rivers from more than 100,000 obsolete barriers. But thousands of hydropower dams are being built in other parts of the world.“Catastrophic losses in migratory fish populations show we cannot continue destroying our rivers,” said Arjan Berkhuysen, at the World Fish Migration Foundation. “This has immense consequences for people and nature across the globe. We can and need to act now before these keystone species are lost for good.”She said migratory fish were often the driving force in food chains because they transport nutrients: “If these fish populations continue to decline, there will be far-reaching consequences for many species which rely on them.”The report, led by Stefanie Deinet at the Zoological Society of London, examined data from 1,406 populations of 247 species. There are 1,100 species that must migrate to survive. The researchers said much more data was needed for regions outside Europe and North America to go beyond the general trends presented in the report.Migratory fish often use water temperature as a cue to start their journeys, but dams can significantly lower the temperature of river water. Global heating is also a factor, and can also change rainfall patterns. “So you get these very unnatural flows that can really have an impact on migratory fish,” said Hogan.“Not all dams are created equal,” he added. “Some dams are more environmentally damaging than others and how you place, design and operate them is important.” The damage to ecosystems and livelihoods must be taken more into account when building new dams, he said.Stephanie Januchowski-Hartley, at Swansea University, UK, said the millions of small obstructions to rivers, such as road culverts, also needed to be considered: “The cumulative effects of those are potentially greater than that of larger infrastructure, because of sheer numbers in the waterscape.”“We know why we’re losing these fish and we know what to do to save or restore them,” Hogan said. “It’s now a matter of public awareness and public will.” Stuart Orr, at WWF, said: “The world needs to implement an emergency recovery plan for the benefit of people and nature.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c54a2118256d158e747e881be311e7135c8447a/0_319_1483_890/master/1483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=646cb959d36a39b515ea39db5ea1c31e","title":"caught in the act camera traps snare rarest species in pictures","story":"Snow leopards, tapirs, oriental storks and many others feature in WWF’s new collection.

However, just because the weather is warmer and lockdown has left some of us with more time for labour-intensive dishes, the slow cooker is to be ignored at your peril. If you’re smart, it will come in handy throughout the summer – not least because it saves you sweating over a hot oven. Here are 10 of the best slow-cooker summer recipes.We will start with a classic, versatile main. A slow cooker is the right size to fit a whole chicken, and the long, slow cooking time adds a succulent, rotisserie-style texture to the meat. Downshiftology’s Lisa Bryan gets crispy chicken skin by putting the bird in dry and then finishing it under the grill for a minute or two. Few foods are as versatile as roast chicken, and you can always use the meat for salads, curries or stir-fries, or just eat it with your hands.Pulled pork might easily be the most overdone food trend of the last decade – remember when KFC started selling pulled chicken to prove its spurious hipster credentials? – but, listen, it tastes nice and not everyone wants to ride the culinary zeitgeist 247. Plus slow cookers are made for pulled pork. Chowhound’s recipe is beautifully spiced and just moist enough. A 2kg pork shoulder is relatively cheap, and will provide a family with several meals.While we are on the subject of slow-cooked barbecue-style meats, it would be remiss of me not to mention NorthSouth Food’s recipe for Marmite rubbed ribs, which uses the spread as a kind of savoury ultra-miso. Smear two tablespoons on a kilo of short ribs, marinate for 36 hours and then slow cook for a further eight. The author doesn’t usually like Marmite, but concedes: “The sharp bitterness mellows into a soft, salty tingle that gives depth and layers to food, yielding darkly delicious, savoury meat.”Although slow cookers are a wonderful tool for cooking meat, they are also fantastic for breaking down dried beans. Oh My Veggies has a recipe for smoky “refried” black beans that is perfect for summer. Put your soaked beans into the slow cooker with vegetable stock and spices, cook for 10 hours and blend – and that’s it, no frying required.If you would rather use your slow cooker for sides, it is a surprisingly good instrument for potato salad especially if, like me, you have a tendency to take your eye off the ball and end up serving everyone wet mash. Chris Foster of 12 Tomatoes makes his by adding flour, mustard and vinegar to raw chopped potato and onion, and cooking it on the lowest setting for five hours.Most homemade salsas will leave you questioning the point of the shop-bought stuff, and The Magical Slow Cooker’s recipe is no exception. It is incredibly easy, too: fresh tomatoes, tinned tomatoes, onion, chillis and garlic go into the slow cooker for three hours. Blend it with salt and coriander, and you’re done.Friends of mine swear by making porridge in a slow cooker – they make it before bed so it is ready for the morning – but the weather’s too hot for porridge and my friends are weird. Better, however, is Amy’s Healthy Baking’s recipe for slow-cooked granola. It is deceptively easy to make, with clusters forming thanks to the addition of egg white. The trick is to slightly vent the lid during cooking, to stop the oats from going soggy.Don’t forget that a slow cooker is a perfect vehicle for desserts, too. Crazy for Crust has discovered that it takes all of the faff – and deep-seated fear of violent kitchen explosions – out of dulce de leche. By using the slow cooker as a water bath for mason jars full of condensed milk, you can cut out most of the hard work. And then, with your jar of dulce de leche, you have exactly what you need to make Nigella’s no-churn salted caramel ice cream.Similarly, you can use the water-bath method to make creme brulee without the terror of dragging a baking tin full of boiling water out of an oven. Maryanne Cabrera from The Little Epicurean flavours hers with tea before leaving the puddings to set for three hours in her slow cooker. Obviously it is creme brulee, so you still have to caramelise the sugar with a blowtorch, but after all that waiting it is probably quite cathartic to attack something with fire.

Worse still for Cardiff is that Mitrovic, the ision’s golden boot winner, is expected to return at Craven Cottage on Thursday, when Fulham hope to seal a spot at Wembley next week having shown their class to establish a healthy buffer.Neil Harris, the Cardiff manager, accused Fulham of being overzealous in their celebrations – “it looked like they had won the tie,” he said. But as Parker, who defended his players by saying he “didn’t see anything that was over the top,” pointed out they have every right to be cheerful after a comfortable win.Fulham are in a rosy position but had to recover following an unconvincing start, with an outstanding piece of defending by Michael Hector ensuring the game was goalless at the interval. He miraculously scooped the ball off the line and away from danger as Robert Glatzel attempted to poke home after Marek Rodak parried Leandro Bacuna’s shot there is a reason some supporters have affectionately given him the moniker ‘Virgil van Mike’. “When you come under a little bit of pressure, you need to withstand it,” said Parker. “Heccy did very well and over the course of the second half our quality shone.”Mitrovic missed the trip to south Wales with a hamstring complaint but Parker, who said it was a “calculated decision” to omit the striker with the bigger picture in mind, is hopeful his 26-goal talisman will play a part in the return leg. Fulham, as they did during Mitrovic’s three-match ban last month, coped but despite two excellent goals they lacked a focal point, with Bobby Decordova-Reid, the former Cardiff forward, isolated in attack.“Aleks has picked up a little bit of a knock, a little bit of an issue,” Parker said. “We went into the game knowing this was going to be over two legs. We needed to make a decision that was best for the game and I think the right thing to do was to give him a few more days to hopefully get him ready for Thursday.”Lee Tomlin’s early influence began to wane and Cardiff ran out of ideas when Fulham took the lead through Onomah, who eluded three defenders before tucking the ball beyond Alex Smithies. When he picked up possession on the edge of the box there seemed little danger but the midfielder proceeded to expertly swivel away from Marlon Pack, turn Sean Morrison and then jink inside Curtis Nelson before applying the finishing touch. It was a magnificent goal that spurred Fulham into life.“He needed a bit of a home, a bit of love,” Parker said of Onomah, who ran to his manager to celebrate. “He’s got every facet. It was a fantastic goal.”Slowly Fulham began to sap Cardiff of any belief, passing them to death as they went in search of a second. It eventually came as full time loomed, but it was worth the wait. Kebano has developed into a trusty dead-ball specialist of late and here he scored his third direct free-kick in nine days, curling a delightful effort into the top corner to double Fulham’s advantage and leave Cardiff with work to do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4974dff4ad4f3afb5ded342cc6923c618d2d365/3_0_2793_1676/master/2793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd3092b5d6218979b5e46d1517f70fe3","title":"defence new priority watford as pozzo mistakes manager","story":"Club will not rush to appoint manager and will avoid expensive forward gambles but talented young players offer hope As the season progressed and their team failed to drag themselves clear of the relegation battle Watford were forced to draw up detailed contingency plans in case the worst was to happen, but until Sunday they continued to believe they would find a way out of danger. Those who had assembled the squad were convinced of the quality of its leading lights – players such as Ismaïla Sarr, Abdoulaye Doucouré, Gerard Deulofeu, Troy Deeney and Étienne Capoue – and whatever the mounting evidence presented by the league table they found it inconceivable they would fail.On Monday they gathered at the training ground at London Colney, separated by a hedge from the Arsenal team whose victory over them, and the defeat to Aston Villa, during the final week had sealed their fate, and confronted the fact that the worst-case scenario was indeed the one they had to deal with.In a joint statement Gino Pozzo, the club’s owner, and their chairman, Scott Duxbury, admitted to “mistakes that were made surrounding the team this season” and pledged “to do everything in our power” to return them to the top-flight. “We have to be honest with ourselves and admit our efforts surrounding the team were not good enough,” they said. “There will be lessons learned and changes made but, from today, we move forward.”Regret and recrimination start immediately. That the performance in defeat at Arsenal, even with defending for which mere haplessness was a distant aspiration, was the best since the restart by a significant margin will add to their disappointment. Many will consider a squad of players who have often looked disinterested responsible for this, but that the attacking unit suddenly seemed cohesive and productive on Sunday was not just down to last-day desperation. It was the first time all season Watford have played two specialist forwards plus specialist midfielders on the right and left – in other words, their best formation.Javi Gracia never had the chance to pick Sarr Quique Sánchez Flores only had Deeney for his final three matches (though did not seem inclined to use him Pearson, given more time and a fit squad, insisted on playing Deeney as a sole striker, with only occasionally encouraging results. For all the outrage and the embarrassment that followed his dismissal, Sunday demonstrated Pearson’s departure might not have come too soon, but too late.One thing that had been delivered prematurely was Deeney’s footballing obituary, with the club captain, again playing after painkilling injections and with a heavily strapped knee – the operation he has long needed will happen in the next week – back to somewhere near his best when finally being allowed to combine given the right players in the right positions. There was also an encouraging cameo off the bench from João Pedro, an 18-year-old Brazilian who is one of several young players on the fringes of the first team – also including Domingos Quina, Ben Wilmot and Tom Dele-Bashiru – who are likely to have many more opportunities if they stick around for another season.Changes will not be limited to personnel. Under Pozzo, Watford have pursued a deliberate policy of underspending on defenders, saving their money for younger forwards with potentially greater resale values. They have sanctioned eight-figure gambles on strikers while assembling a backline on a relative pittance – the seven most-used defenders this season, with 172 league starts between them, collectively cost slightly less than Andre Gray, their occasionally used reserve striker, who started seven games. How Craig Dawson gifted Arsenal a first-minute penalty or the ease with which Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang collected Kieran Tierney’s long throw to score the third appears to have finally convinced them to change tack.Inevitably, Watford’s worries are not confined to the pitch and the double disaster of coronavirus and relegation will severely test their financial security. They have posted pre-tax profits in three of the past four years but have been extremely reliant on broadcast income that is about to dry up, are still fully staffed despite plunging revenues even in the Premier League and instead of banking season ticket sales they have spent recent weeks issuing refunds. Never will the parachute payments be more gratefully received.“In sport,” Pozzo and Duxbury concluded, “you will always face moments of great disappointment but it’s how you react that defines you.” After a season featuring an unusually high number of managers and an unusually low number of victories a moment of great disappointment has certainly been reached. Their decisions this summer will decide how many more are still to come."},{"url":null,"title":"colour blind adoption one of my first clear memories as a child is knowing i looked different","story":"Growing up, Sam Douglas was treated the same as her white sister – but it was not until she met her birth mother that she finally felt she belonged somewhereI was born in Australia in the early 60s. My mother, a Greek woman, was only 18 years old, unmarried and pregnant to a Chinese man. It was hugely frowned upon, so she was forced to give me up for adoption.I was taken from her immediately. She wasn’t allowed to see me, or hold me. In those days most people wanted a baby that looked like them, so I sat in the hospital waiting for people who were open to adopting a coloured child. I was adopted at three months old in January 1964.My adoptive parents had travelled around the world and wanted to adopt an Indian baby. They got a phone call saying there was a GreekChinese baby available, if they were interested. My adoptive dad’s mother lived in Sydney and they went to introduce her to her new granddaughter. Apparently she nearly dropped me when she saw a coloured baby.One of my first clear memories as a child is knowing I looked different. I would look in the mirror in the morning, then I would go and have breakfast with my adoptive family – who were all white – and wonder who I was. When I started school, these physical differences became even more obvious.I had a teacher who would tell me what a dirty, filthy little girl I was every morning. She would tell me to go to the toilets and scrub all the colour off. She presumably wanted me to be white. That was when I started feeling shame about myself.We moved suburbs and I changed school. All the kids were white again. I got teased endlessly about being adopted and coloured. After school, when walking home the boys would hurl their bags around their heads, hitting and taunting me. I remember my adoptive sister running home to tell Mum “they’re hurting her”, Mum’s reply was “tell her to stop being stupid and get home”.When I was nine or 10, my mum’s side of the family wanted to take a generational photo. It was my great grandmother, my grandmother, my mother and sister. I was pushed to the side, as I wasn’t blood and didn’t fit in. It is one of my most painful memories.The word “colour-blind” is how my parents treated me. They thought that if I wasn’t treated any differently to my adoptive sister, there wasn’t a problem. The truth is, I desperately needed specific support to get me through those years.When I was about 12, a Sri Lankan girl started at my school and we bonded straight away. We went on a school trip together to Burnie in Tasmania. During assembly on our first morning, the Sri Lankan girl and myself had to get on the stage with the principal. He looked at us then told everyone that “this is what black people look like”. We stood on the stage holding each other, crying.Over the years I wondered about my biological mother. I wondered whether she ever thought about me. I had no idea whether she wanted to know me, or if she was happy that I wasn’t in her life. I knew I would definitely look for her someday, but I also knew that doing so would be a risk.At the age of 18, I reached out to the New South Wales Department of Youth and Community Services who held all adoption records back then. I was in for a big surprise. My mother Zena had left a lot of information for me. I was even able to get more details about a few of her brothers.For some reason I didn’t take the next step to find her until I was 20 years old. When I felt ready, I decided not make a phone call. Instead I paid a visit to one of my uncles. He looked at me and straight away said: “You’re Zena’s daughter.”That night we drove to Zena’s house and knocked on the door. If I thought my adrenalin was racing when I met my uncle, it went crazy knowing I was about to meet my biological mother, the person I had dreamed about my whole life.She opened the door and knew who I was straight away. For a while we stood there looking at each other, tears running down our faces. We hugged and I knew I was home.Zena and I talked into the early hours, until we were both exhausted. After a few hours of sleep, we woke up the next morning to meet the rest of the family. So many of them came over to meet me. That night Zena took me to meet my half sister. There were a lot more tears.For the first time in my life, I could compare myself with the thing that other kids took for granted. My sister and I had exactly the same hands and the three of us had exactly the same body shape. It doesn’t seem much, but for me it was huge. I finally felt I belonged somewhere.It was the most traumatic, most wonderful day of my life.From then on, my mother and I had a lot of contact. We faced challenges – especially around our differences in expectations, since she was brought up traditionally Greek, and I was an Aussie girl.These days, I talk to Zena once or twice a month, it’s great having that contact, it makes me feel complete. The blood tie is something I treasure, though my biological family don’t understand why I live so far away in Cairns. But, with the upbringing I’ve had, I was taught to give everyone space to live their own lives.My adoptive mother passed away three years ago and I have very little contact with my adoptive sister. I think we wouldn’t have met in the real world, as we are such different people.I still have a strong relationship with my adoptive dad and we talk a couple of times each week. He has been my rock throughout my life. At no stage has dad ever judged or pushed me away due to my differences.As an adult I still get the odd racist taunt. The best thing is that I don’t take it to heart these days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/744184d8a80bc1f07e8833d663b6d470a764d97a/0_174_5558_3335/master/5558.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7682a97b6be3fa34bd07b31e5a7ffa05","title":"i cant contact odeon cinemas to get a ticket refund","story":"We booked a one-off showing that was cancelled but now we can’t get our money backWe booked in advance two tickets at £23.25 each for the Guildford Odeon’s live showing of the Royal Opera House production of Elektra on 18 June.

Headteachers explain how it’s doneWhen it became apparent that the school lockdown was imminent, principal Vicki Redhead and her team at Bishop Creighton academy, a primary school in Peterborough, wrestled with a tricky issue. How can you make online-only learning as safe as possible? They came up with a simple solution. The devices they used at school were already set up and locked down. Why not just let children take those school devices home?“Otherwise, those devices – which were bought for the benefit of the children – were just going to sit in a cupboard,” she says. “Luckily, we had already made the decision that every child should have their own device. You’d never ask a child to share an exercise book.”Today’s tech makes it much simpler to make those tweaks – and schools which had been exploring its possibilities before the lockdown have already considered many of the big questions around online safety. Choosing devices that can be rolled out with ease is a key consideration in reducing IT complexity. At University Technical College (UTC) Reading in Berkshire, pupils had already received training on professional behaviour both face-to-face and online. “They know what’s right and what’s wrong, and the consequences of doing something that is outside what we would consider professional,” says principal Jon Nicholls. “And they get it. We have close ties with industry, and our students understand professional boundaries.”However, a secure platform is also crucial. UTC Reading’s Microsoft Teams package has considerable functionality for keeping both students and staff safe online. All student data is held securely. Only invited students can attend classes – nobody else can join. Teachers can invite students into small groups for additional support work without other students being aware. Another teacher or learning support staff member is always online to actively monitor student chat. And lessons are recorded and stored – including any chat – so they can be checked if any concerns are raised by staff or students.Choosing the correct platform can also help to solve the problem of device access. There has been an explosion of cloud-based learning platforms and tools in the education sector that are designed to be used solely in a web browser, says Brendan Tapping, chief executive officer at Bishop Chadwick Catholic Education Trust, a multi-academy trust that serves south Tyneside, Sunderland and east Durham.“This has overcome many of the hurdles that students would have faced when trying to complete work from home. The cloud-based learning platforms allow students to complete their homework anytime, anywhere from almost any device, including their own mobile phones,” he says.These platforms are also key to allowing staff to easily communicate, collaborate and share learning resources, tips and strategies, helping to replicate face-to-face staffroom discussions and prevent teachers themselves from feeling isolated.But although being online has its own risks, the biggest risk for a child is living in an environment where threats exist – and lockdown could mean more risk for them. How can schools keep track of them in an online-only environment? Again, they’re using established best practice combined with tech and the art of good communication.At Ribblesdale, the school’s online learning platform, Teams, logs everything – including how often a child logs on to the platform, which the school can then monitor. “If a child is not accessing any work, that’s the first potential warning that something is wrong,” says Cox. “But we won’t use technology if it’s not the most applicable way of safeguarding. We might simply decide to phone up a child if that’s the right thing to do.”Regular communication has also been paramount at Bishop Chadwick Catholic Education Trust. “All pupils and parents receive regular wellbeing phone calls from a familiar member of staff, with our most vulnerable pupils and parents or carers being spoken to on a daily basis,” says Tapping. “It’s key to ensuring our families feel fully supported and we can ensure we keep our community as safe as possible in their virtual learning world.”And as school leaders begin to contemplate what school life might look like in the future, Redhead is optimistic that the key to staying safe online is having that strong safeguarding culture embedded in the first place – and that hasn’t stopped in lockdown. “I’ve got 200-plus children accessing Teams, and nobody’s misbehaving!” she says. “Nobody’s using it inappropriately, and that’s not because I’m telling them not to do it – that’s around the culture in the school. We shouldn’t be afraid of tech. It’s where our children’s futures are going to be.”Five tips for online security1. Ensure staff are trained in online safety and recognise the security risk posed by phishing emails.2. Choose a cloud-based, secure online learning platform which allows recording of lessons and chats.3. Keep lines of communication with pupils and other agencies open – if necessary, just make a phone call.4.

A huge drop in sales during March seemed to sound the death knell for at least some sectors of the industry. Online sales, on the other hand, have rocketed and new approaches are emerging among those retailers that are learning to be agile.“Covid-19 has really accelerated a bunch of inevitables. A lot of things are just happening a lot faster,” says Steve Hewett, global vice president for retail customer experience at the tech and consultancy firm Capgemini.For many companies, online is exploding. “This was already happening,” says Hewett. “But some companies are achieving the sort of online growth in weeks that they expected in three or four years.”This has implications for how companies do business, and it’s likely to be crucial to be able to deliver a hybrid onlineoffline experience to the post-Covid-19 customer. Here are five trends currently reshaping the retail sector:Brands are getting chattierIt seems that customers engaged with brands more during lockdown. “For years, buying something meant going to a physical place, seeing the branding in the store and understanding who that brand is,” says Adrian McDermott, president of products at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “We need to establish the digital equivalents of finding, meeting and having those conversations.”Prices could remain “sticky”Rajesh Bhargave, a consumer behaviour expert, suggests that retailers need to be wary of changing their prices – whether up or down. “Consumers tend to remember what they paid previously and would view price increases as unjust in poor economic conditions.”Dropping prices is not always the answer either. Many consumers will have taken a financial hit and their wallets will be closed for concessionary spending. A knee-jerk reaction might be to cut prices to bring back that demand but, says Bhargave, associate professor of marketing at Imperial College Business School in London, this could have negative long-term effects and erode pricing power: “If you’ve been paying £10 for a meal and suddenly that’s £8 you start to wonder about the quality of the meal.”Brands have to add valueInstead of dropping prices, brands are likely to start looking at different ways to add value, says Bhargave. “If people want to dine at restaurants, they might want a more private and safe experience,” he says. “So how can you start offering a different service that charges a higher price and offers better value?”Video calling is another area that business is only starting to explore. “With so much taking place on Zoom, is there a higher-end service you can provide in this area?” Selfridges, for example, is offering online beauty and styling appointments, with products then delivered to customers at home.This is part of a move towards getting more revenue from fewer people, and appointments for in-store shopping also fall into this category. “It’s all part of offering a more customised, high-end experience,” says Bhargave.To bring the joy back into shopping, some stores are putting their energies into their window displays to encourage browsing and others are providing queue entertainment.The need for a new kind of agilityThings may never be the same. “We’ve almost got to hit the reset button,” says Hewett. “People are returning to school and the office and there’s no playbook on what the wants and needs are.” Moreover, whatever they are could change dramatically again. Hewett adds: “There’s an organisational need for agility that wasn’t there before, as brands aren’t able to be as tactical as they would like.”Things are changing fast. But you can be faster.

England, France, Ireland and Italy expect fans to be allowed back into sports grounds by October, although with capacities at no more than half, but Wales will not return to the Principality Stadium until next year.The schedule, which will be ratified next month, means England’s Premiership clubs will be without their international players for the first three weeks of the 2020-21 campaign, while the weekend after the final round of the eight nations tournament is meant to be the start of the European Champions Cup and the Challenge Cup, competitions that have been shortened by one week because of the late start to the club season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9970f795c09d4d0aa3efdae9f216e035b341ecbf/0_39_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fadcd9a5807afece2bcb79e9c8827db","title":"evergreen stuart broad can look back to new zealand in 2008 for inspiration","story":"England are poised to win a three-Test series after losing the opener for the first time since Broad made an impact 12 years agoThe experts do get it right more often than not in the 21st century, whatever our leaders may say. As the forecasters said would be the case, there was no play at Old Trafford on Monday. So the series has yet to be decided but the strong expectation remains that, weather permitting, England will win it. They need eight more wickets in what is likely to be a maximum of 98 overs. Even Gordon Greenidge and the rest of the 1984 musketeers would struggle to knock off the 389 more runs West Indies require to win.If England do prevail this will be the first time they have come back from 1-0 down in a three-match series since 2008 in New Zealand. One person who could produce chapter and verse on this is Stuart Broad, because he has that sort of memory and he was there on his second England tour alongside Jimmy Anderson. Both began that series as understudies. But against the odds England lost the first Test in Hamilton after which Michael Vaughan and Peter Moores took the decision to drop Steve Harmison and Matthew Hoggard and to replace them with the youngsters, whereupon England won the next two Tests in Wellington and Napier. Since then Broad and Anderson have become an ever-more classy double act, more Morecambe and Wise than Mike and Bernie Winters.Now Broad and Anderson are the senior citizens but they are so much more durable than Harmison and Hoggard. They can be rotated but not dropped. Broad has been sensational in this game. So far his figures over two innings are 17-6-39-8, seven of those scalps coming from what was regarded as the less favoured Brian Statham End. Broad’s services were not required when play resumed on Sunday morning as West Indies sought to avoid the follow-on, but Joe Root will not make that mistake again on Tuesday.Broad will be gliding towards the crease, his lucky bandana flapping in the breeze – he will have to keep wearing it after a haircut – in the knowledge that he requires just one more wicket to notch his 500th in Test cricket, a staggering achievement for any bowler, especially one who does not bowl at express pace and who, in his latter years, scarcely swings the ball against right-handed batsmen. Broad’s record is a triumph of will as well as skill.The forecast is better England’s bowlers have had a chance to recharge batteries – not that they have looked short of energy so far in this contest – and West Indies could be forgiven for having half an eye on their flight home. So the anticipation is that Broad will be a vital part of another comeback 12 years after his experiences on the north island of New Zealand – unless West Indies can deliver one last dramatic twist at the end of a series that has exceeded expectations despite only sporadic cooperation from the English weather."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb0946186030e9a85d0f23d50fab7f516b9eb68a/20_224_4484_2690/master/4484.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a34f818c636883ab4861be2249ee3dfe","title":"mclaren lando norris do everything i can tackling racism british grand prix f1","story":"Lando Norris has reasserted his commitment to fighting racism. In the runup to the British Grand Prix this weekend, the McLaren driver was unequivocal in his belief that he and his colleagues could make a difference in promoting equality. He is also confident drivers will agree to make a collective gesture before the race, after their efforts had proved disorganised at the previous two meetings.Norris goes into the British GP, the first of a double header at Silverstone, in fine form. He is fourth in the world championship, having taken a podium place at the first round in Austria, denying Lewis Hamilton third place with the fastest lap of the race on his final circuit. At the Styrian GP, which also took place at the Red Bull Ring, he claimed fifth with a brilliant late charge, passing Daniel Ricciardo on the penultimate lap and both of the Racing Point drivers – Sergio Pérez and Lance Stroll – on his final lap. McLaren are third behind Mercedes and Red Bull in the constructors’ championship.The 20-year-old is in his second season in F1 but was one of the first to publicly speak out against racism after Hamilton called out drivers for their silence on the subject. Norris has taken a knee alongside Hamilton at all three races this season. He believes it was imperative to act publicly in support of the cause.Norris said: “I take a knee because that is most meaningful for the situation we are in. I want to have the biggest impact I can on ending racism. It is one of the few times in life when people like me or us as drivers can have an impact on the future. This is one of the biggest initiatives around the world to go up against something and make a change going into the future and shape it in some way. I want to do everything I can.”At the first round in Austria, F1 arranged time for the drivers to gather on the grid to make an anti-racism gesture. However, at the following two rounds there were no formal arrangements, and while gestures did occur there was no display of collective unity. Some drivers were late, some did not wear the “End Racism” T-shirts and the procedure was rushed.With the McLaren performing strongly through the fast corners of Austria, the team will be optimistic they can return another good result at their home race. In contrast, Ferrari are struggling with an underpowered car that is well off the pace. They are fifth in the world championship. McLaren have not finished in front of Ferrari in the constructors’ championship since 2011 but Norris believes his team have every chance to overcome the Scuderia this year.“We have an opportunity to beat them,” he said. “We have an opportunity to fight them throughout the season. It would mean a lot to us as a team to take the next step and beat a team that’s been front-running for many years, to show the progress we have made. Ferrari are an extremely good team with a big budget, a much bigger budget than us, so it would be rewarding for us to beat them.”This weekend’s race and the following weekend’s 70th Anniversary GP, also at Silverstone, will be held behind closed doors. Norris is excited to be racing once more but admitted the lack of fans is a real blow. He said: “We call it the home race because of the fans. When they are not there it’s very difficult to call it a home race. You’re just racing on your home track without it having any proper meaning or atmosphere.“Why it was so cool last year was because of all the fans. That’s what makes it special. It’s not just the fact it’s the country I was born in. The reason everyone loves their home race is because of the fans. When you don’t have the fans it doesn’t mean as much, it’s not as cool, it’s not as special.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1130fa99e26c9a037fcd6bb590f55f84001a44e0/0_8_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4edafcd4a1b1fd439598e21f8042fb27","title":"tregoning counting on mohaather to bring overdue glory at goodwood","story":"John Gosden’s veteran stayer can land the Goodwood Cup for a fourth year in a row, while Graignes looks over-priced at 33-1Five days of Glorious Goodwood get under way with an intriguing clash of talents in the Goodwood Cup, Aidan O’Brien setting a poser for punters by fielding his Irish Derby winner Santiago. The weight-for-age scale favours improving three-year-olds like him in high summer and he carries a stone less than all his rivals but it may not be enough because among them is Straarius (3.15).The winner of this race for the past three years, Straarius still doesn’t have anything that could really be called a flaw, for all that he suffers about one defeat per season. He appeared distracted in the paddock at Royal Ascot last month but turned in an imperious performance just the same.Unless that has taken a really significant toll, John Gosden’s chestnut should be good enough here. Santiago could turn in a career best and still be second. Nayef Road is worth respecting on this sounder surface, however, and should not be given too much of a soft lead.1.45 Sucellus ran out of room in the closing stages at Epsom and York this month, but those efforts also suggested he is running into form. The return to this distance should help and he is attractively rated on the same mark from which he beat Cape Cavalli, the likely favourite, in September. Babbo’s Boy also looks overpriced after one bad run on soft.2.15 This has the look of a decent Vintage Stakes, with the Chesham winner, Battleground, taking on horses that ran well in the Superlative and the Coventry. But the pick of them might be a horse brought along more gradually, as Youth Spirit showed plenty of ability in breaking his maiden at Newmarket during the July meeting. From a fast family, he is thought likely to be better again on the sounder surface he meets here.2.45 Space Blues is convincing as the most likely winner of this Lennox Stakes but odds of 33-1 about Graignes are ridiculous, considering he has repeatedly run well in top-class company while trained in France over the past two years. This is his first run since a trip to Riyadh in February but George Baker has his string in form and reports this colt straight enough if good enough. 3.45 With several confirmed front-runners in the line-up, this sprint handicap could turn into a real burn-up, which might tee things up nicely for Celsius. A strong finisher when scoring at last year’s Glorious meeting, he ran well to be second in a smaller field at the July meeting behind an in-form rival.We have a £100 account credit from Betfair to offer the winner of our Goodwood competition, which this week will run from Tuesday to Friday inclusive. You must pick four fancied horses to lose at Goodwood on each of those days this week. The winner will be the person whose nominated horses have the shortest average Starting Price, provided they were all beaten.You will be eliminated if:i) any of your nominated horses wins,ii) any of your nominated horses is returned at an SP bigger than 12-1,iii) you nominate more or less than four runners at Goodwood in a single day.Two or more of your four can be in the same race if you wish. If you pick a non-runner, you must make a replacement choice before the start-time of the last race at Goodwood that day. If everyone has been eliminated by Friday, we’ll run a fresh competition that day for the same prize. If there’s a tie for first place, the prize will be split among those tied for first.After a King George carved up by the two dominant stables of British and Irish Flat racing and won easily by the hot favourite, the Sussex Stakes this week is a much more attractive contest. Seven talented animals, none of which can be ruled out, will represent five trainers in a thrilling test of brilliance, a fitting highlight for Glorious Goodwood, with at least the possibility of a winner for whom victory would matter enormously, rather than being one more trophy among many.“It would mean an awful lot,” says Marcus Tregoning but even that frank statement underplays what is at stake. He has always wanted to win a Sussex and to do so now, with the hugely promising Mohaather, would close the book on a difficult and often disappointing period since the trainer last won a Group One, with Sir Percy in the Derby 14 years ago.“Whitsbury’s like the Covid-19 racecourse, it’s very relaxed, there’s not too much going on,” Tregoning says. “He gets to see hares and all the rare birds, there’s lots for him to look at but it’s very relaxing.“We do long exercises, we walk 20 minutes before we even do a canter and then we walk back. So there’s every chance for a highly-strung horse to learn not to be that way. He can be a little bit of a handful but nothing you don’t expect any thoroughbred horse to do.” Success in Wednesday’s race would have particular meaning for Tregoning, whose mentor, Dick Hern, always loved to win during Glorious week. “If I was being quite honest, I slightly prefer it to Ascot.“I’m looking forward to all the races later on. If the Sussex Stakes doesn’t work out, you can bet your bottom dollar that he will win a Group One somewhere.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba7497900f3f5a9b022c01b2fcfa315aa11db119/0_229_3700_2221/master/3700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=106156bd4b8715b93b3942d78c61365f","title":"englands top order solidity has andrew strauss thinking of ashes","story":"Rory Burns and Dom Sibley appear to have solved a problem that has blighted the Test team since the playing retirement of the former ECB director of cricketIt took England so long to find a new opening batsman that the man they were trying to replace ended up taking on the job of searching himself. So long that he had to quit before he had finished.In the eight years since Andrew Strauss retired in 2012, England have tried 18 openers in 18 combinations. There was Alastair Cook, obviously, Nick Compton, Joe Root, and Michael Carberry, then Sam Robson, Jonathan Trott, Adam Lyth, and Moeen Ali, Alex Hales, Ben Duckett and Haseeb Hameed, Keaton Jennings and Mark Stoneman, Joe Denly, Jason Roy, Rory Burns, and, just lately, Dom Sibley and Zak Crawley.Strauss had a hand in picking some of them, during his three-year stint as the ECB’s director of cricket. He is at this Test, working for Sky, and running the Red For Ruth campaign to raise money for the foundation he set up in his wife’s name after she died in 2018.“When I cast my mind back to the time I was director of cricket there was a real frustration that the Test team seemed to take one step forward and then go one step back,” he says. “It didn’t feel like we were making the progress we wanted to, in particular with the top-order batting, where we sort of had a conveyor belt of people coming in and out where we showed promise but weren’t able to show the consistency we needed.”Compton, Jennings, Lyth, Robson, and Root made centuries, Stoneman and Hales made five fifties in 11 Tests each. But Strauss thinks it is only now it finally feels like they are close to fixing the problem.“If you look at that batting conundrum we’re closer to sorting that out than we have been for some time. Sibley and Burns at the top of the order are made of the right stuff temperamentally,” he says. “They’ve got slightly quirky games but very effective games, and that is a big tick. And as we all know if the openers are doing their job then that makes it so much easier for the shot players coming in down the order.”On Sunday, Burns and Sibley put on 114 together, it was England’s first century partnership for the first wicket in England in four years, and the second anywhere since Cook retired in 2018. It was a little slow – and between all their tics and stylistic eccentricities, it certainly was not much to look at – but it worked. They are second and third in the averages for this series, behind Ben Stokes. Burns has 234 runs at 46.80, and Sibley 226 at 45.20. Between them, they have faced 202 of the 529 overs West Indies have bowled.This being England, Strauss’s thoughts are already leaping on ahead to how they might do in the Ashes. “For me, the biggest challenge was opening the batting in Australia,” he says. “There are two reasons for that, one is that the extra bounce of the ball is very hard to deal with, especially when the ball is new, and the other is that the Kookaburra does tend to swing a lot for the first 10 or 15 overs. After that, it gets much flatter.“ So you have that feeling as an opener in Australia that you’ve really got to dig deep and find a way through those first 10 overs or so when you feel the advantage is really with the bowlers and then if you can get through that then you’re in great position to go on and get a big score.“I look at their games and I think Rory Burns showed some fantastic technique and ticker against Australia last year. He played brilliantly in that Ashes series, probably the pick of the English batsmen,” Strauss adds, turning back to last summer, when Burns scored 390 runs at 39.“With Dom Sibley, his method of getting across the stumps and into the channel outside works well in most circumstances, but he might have to be careful of that potential to be caught down the leg-side, or at leg slip in Australia.”Sibley did score a century against Australia A at the MCG in February, so he has had some good experience there. All that is a way off yet. England have a series against Pakistan to play first and tours of Sri Lanka and India this winter. They face them, for the first time in the long time, with some hope their openers will be up to it. There is something reassuring about knowing England have a reliably boring opener or two. It feels like the ravens have returned to the Tower at last."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4aa03072d18123ab652251d59719f11edff4761/466_453_4091_2455/master/4091.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e06fe8ccf324349876bf48d04e2945e7","title":"california investigations amazon workers coronavirus","story":"Filings allege employees had to share equipment and were not allowed extra time to account for social distancingAmazon is under investigation in California for failing to protect its warehouse employees from the new coronavirus.California’s attorney general Xavier Becerra, the Division of Occupational Safety and Health, and the San Francisco department of public health “have all opened investigations into Amazon’s practices” around the pandemic, San Francisco superior court judge Ethan Schulman wrote in a court filing on Monday.Amazon and the government agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The online retailer is accused of putting workers at “needless risk” by having them share equipment, such as freezer suits, and not allowing extra time in order to respect social distancing, the filing said. The filing originates from a case brought by Chiyomi Brent, a worker at Amazon’s San Francisco fulfillment center.Schulman on Monday refused to issue a preliminary injunction that would have closed the warehouse Brent works at until more precautions are taken. He said Brent had failed to show immediate harm was possible and that three government bodies investigating Amazon were better suited to handle her concerns.SFDPH told Schulman that Amazon‘s practices at the San Francisco facility had improved between visits on 7 July and 16 July, while CalOSHA told the judge its investigation is ongoing following a 14 July inspection.The attorney general’s office told the court last week that its statewide Amazon investigation, which dates back to at least May, also is ongoing.As millions of Americans sheltered in place in early 2020, Amazon saw orders for home goods skyrocket, fueled by customers who were no longer shopping at brick and mortar stores. Meanwhile, workers fulfilling these orders say they lacked adequate protection from coronavirus infections.In April, Amazon was accused of firing three critics of the company’s pandemic response and workers participated in a nationwide sick-out. The workers claimed Amazon failed to provide enough face masks for workers, did not implement regular temperature checks at warehouses as it promised, and has refused to give workers paid sick leave.Amazon has refused to publicly release numbers of Covid-19 infections, but workers began to track the numbers themselves using a tool from worker advocacy group United for Respect. According to that count, there have been more than 80 reports of Covid-19 cases in the state of California since March.Amazon has argued in court papers that it has taken many steps to protect workers, extensively cleaning and disinfecting the San Francisco facility and equipment – including freezer suits – requiring masks and social distancing, among other steps. In a statement earlier this month, an Amazon official said he was unaware of any coronavirus cases at the facility.New York attorney general Letitia James’s office sent a letter to Amazon in April saying the gigantic e-retailer may have violated safety measures and labor practices amid the coronavirus pandemic.

But it must be remembered that the world’s leading scientists are incapable of knowing how the situation will develop. We must not frighten people, but neither should we abuse them by pretending to know everything.”The prime minister said the start of the school year could be undermined without a drastic intervention and said she “very strongly recommended” the return of home working for those who are able to do so. For four weeks from Wednesday, each household may only have social contact with a further five people.People must go shopping alone and they will need to restrict themselves to 30 minutes in a shop.On Monday, the regional president of Catalonia – one of the areas of Spain hardest hit by the virus’s resurgence – said the situation was similar to that before the national lockdown was introduced in March.“We’re in the 10 most important days of the summer and during that time, we’ll see whether we’re capable of sorting out the situation through solidarity, cooperation and a collective effort,” said Quim Torra.“But the situation is critical and if we don’t manage to, then we will have to go backwards.”Nearly 8,000 cases have been diagnosed in Catalonia over the past 14 days – accounting for almost half of the 16,410 detected across Spain. In the neighbouring region of Aragón, where there has also been a rise in infections, 738 new cases were recorded on Friday and Saturday.Many outbreaks have originated in bars and clubs, but other clusters have been traced to seasonal fruit and vegetable pickers, whose poor living and working conditions often make social distancing difficult.Last week, Spanish health authorities acknowledged the country may already be experiencing a second wave of infections following the lifting of the strict, three-month lockdown at the end of June.On Monday, the Spanish health ministry reported 855 new Covid cases over the past 24 hours – 474 of them in Aragón – down from 922 last Friday and 971 the day before that. Figures showed 6,361 cases were recorded over the weekend, bringing Spain’s cumulative total to 278,782.When the pandemic was at its peak on 31 March, Spain had 9,222 new infections in a single day. According to the ministry, six people have died from the coronavirus in Spain over the past seven days.The Catalan government has ordered all nightclubs to close for a fortnight and placed a midnight curfew on bars in and around Barcelona and Lleida, both of which have reported a rise in the number of new cases. It has also advised people in Barcelona to stay at home, but the advice has been ignored as many people flock to beaches.Faced with the closures and curfews, some young people have taken to holding botellones, or drinking parties, in the streets. Torra called for an end to such behaviour, saying: “Today, a botellón isn’t a party it shows a lack of solidarity.”The message was echoed by the French health minister, who urged youngsters to be vigilant and maintain coronavirus safety measures including keeping their distance, washing hands and wearing masks.“When we carry out mass testing we are seeing a lot of young patients … more youngsters than during the previous wave,” Olivier Véran said at the weekend.Jérôme Marty, the president of a French GPs’ union, said the summer holidays would be a crucial point in the coronavirus crisis. “There’s everything at risk in the next three weeks because we’re entering the dangerous period,” he told Europe 1 radio.“This is the time when there’s the most movement and concentration of population. There are areas where there are normally 10,000 inhabitants and suddenly there are 60,000 or 80,000. From one day to the next it can tip to a corresponding rise in the number of hospital admissions.”Fear is growing in Germany of a second coronavirus wave, with some experts saying the country is on the cusp of it, others saying it has already begun, and some referring to a “permanent wave” that will last until a vaccine arrives.Outbreaks in urban areas and among holidaymakers and abattoir and harvest workers have demonstrated how quickly the virus can flare up, placing whole regions at risk of being put under lockdown conditions once again.The country’s public health advisory body, the Robert Koch Institute, has said it is “deeply concerned” about the rise in cases over recent weeks. The new number of new cases climbed past 800 on Friday after several weeks of hovering between 300 and 400. At the pandemic’s height, Germany saw over 6,000 cases a day.The health minister, Jens Spahn, has warned that partying holidaymakers on Mallorca or Ibiza are in danger of forgetting rules such as physical distancing and hand-washing, contributing to the threat of a second wave. He announced he is planning to introduce obligatory testing for travellers returning from areas considered high risk because of their level of coronavirus cases.Michael Kretschmar, the leader of the eastern state of Saxony, has said he believes “the second coronavirus wave is already there”, telling the Rheinischen Post: “On a daily basis we’re dealing with new infection herds which can quickly produce very high numbers.”But Gerd Antes, a medical statistician in the southern city of Freiburg, said the concept of the “second wave” created a false impression and that it was more likely the virus would continue to rise and ebb. The challenge, he added, was be to extinguish the “hot spots” or risk seeing them grow into one large wildfire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c7b511855f2c0fcd99104d603f97ffac0058dc9/0_115_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37c43d64f52de13f7bd616e2d19bfd08","title":"meng wanzhou canada fbi plot documents","story":"Lawyers for the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou have demanded the release of unredacted Canadian spy service documents they say would reveal a plot between the FBI and Canada to “trick” their client.Meng, the Chinese telecom giant’s chief financial officer, was arrested on a US warrant in December 2018 during a stopover in Vancouver. She is charged with violating US sanctions against Iran, and has been fighting extradition ever since.During a videoconference hearing before a federal court in Ottawa, Meng’s lawyers demanded full publication of several documents that had been redacted before and after arrest. A redacted version of the documents has already been released.They said the documents would provide proof of a plot between the US and Canadian authorities.Scott Fenton, one of Meng’s lawyers, said on Monday his client had been questioned for three hours by Canadian customs agents at Vancouver airport without knowing what she was accused of, before being formally arrested.He said that constituted a violation of her rights and justified halting the extradition process.“She was never told the reasons she was detained,” Fenton said. “She was misled she was tricked, in fact.”The Canadian attorney general’s lawyer, Robert Frater, opposed the unredacted publication of the documents and denied any plot with the FBI.He dismissed the allegations as “fanciful inferences from anodyne statements” in the court filings.In a sworn statement delivered to a Vancouver court in July, a Canadian foreign ministry official said the full disclosure of the documents could “renew tensions” between the two countries and put Canadians in danger.A few days after Meng’s arrest in Vancouver, China jailed a former Canadian diplomat, Michael Kovrig, and his fellow countryman Michael Spavor, who were later charged with spying.Their detention is largely seen in the west as a reprisal for Meng’s arrest.The hearing at the federal court in Ottawa was later adjourned and will resume behind closed door on Thursday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9b0aad22638133aa06cd68347bed2390b555e63/0_477_2945_1767/master/2945.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb7ca603b79a21df7596d0b0e25127d","title":"pet cat diagnosed with covid 19 uk government confirms","story":"People advised not to kiss their pets after Siamese cat is thought to have caught virus from its ownersA female Siamese cat has become the first animal in the UK to catch coronavirus, prompting a warning to owners not to kiss their pets or share food with them.The cat from southern England is believed to have caught the virus from their owner in May. It was initially diagnosed by a private vet with feline herpes. But samples from the cat tested positive for Sars-Cov-2 in June as part of a coronavirus screening programme for hundreds of cats at Glasgow Centre for Virus Research.Follow-up samples tested at the Animal Plant Health Laboratory in Weybridge last week confirmed the cat was also infected with Covid-19.The six-year-old cat experienced only mild symptoms including shortness of breath and nasal discharge and has since recovered. But Margaret Hosie, professor of comparative virology at Glasgow University, who leads the screening programme, advised cat owners to “observe very careful hygiene”.She said: “If you have any respiratory signs, then be sure to catch your cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue, and wash your hands before you handle your cat. Don’t kiss your cat. Don’t have the cat sleeping in a bed with you, and don’t share food with the cat.”She expressed surprise that a Siamese cat, a breed which has short fur, caught the disease. “I thought maybe fluffier ones would be more ready to catch any sneezes or cough droplets. But you can’t draw any significance from that.”She stressed that only a handful of cats around the world had tested positive for coronavirus and there was no evidence that the animals could transmit the disease to humans.In early April the British Veterinary Association created panic among cat owners after its president, Daniella Dos Santos, appeared to suggest the UK’s estimated 10.9 million cats should be kept at home during the pandemic.After its website crashed, the BVA was forced to clarify that only owners who were self-isolating should keep their pets indoors if possible, raising the prospect of Larry the Downing Street cat having to go into isolation.Dos Santos said the positive test should not cause alarm. She said: “It is really important that nobody should panic. There have been a tiny handful of cases across the world where pet animals have been infected with covid and there is no evidence that pets can pass on covid to their owners.”She repeated the BVA advice that cat owners who have tested positive for Covid-19 or have symptoms should keep their cats indoors if possible.said: “This is a very rare event with infected animals detected to date only showing mild clinical signs and recovering within in a few days.“There is no evidence to suggest that pets directly transmit the virus to humans. We will continue to monitor this situation closely and will update our guidance to pet owners should the situation change.”Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said it was a reminder for people to wash their hands after contact with animals. “This is the first case of a domestic cat testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK but should not be a cause for alarm,” she said.“The investigation into this case suggest that the infection was spread from humans to animal, and not the other way round. At this time, there is no evidence that pets can transmit the disease to humans.”A small number of cases of animals infected with Covid-19 have been reported globally, including a number of tigers and lions at the Bronx zoo in New York."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bd0c199478476450fee5a2ee889fba3af4a99b5/48_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b541628de5ee0e5a7edda77739d022b","title":"tv drama goes viral the german danish series that foresaw covid 19","story":"Sløborn, which was filmed last year, airs on German TV as world fights coronavirusWhen a bird-flu type disease originating in pigeons is discovered in northern China, the people living on an idyllic island in the North Sea think nothing of it.But one day a sailing boat carrying the mummified bodies of a British couple washes up on the island. It subsequently emerges that they have brought the virus with them.It sounds like a plot inspired by Covid-19, but in fact, Sløborn, a joint German-Danish production for TV, was filmed last year and has been airing on German TV as Europe and the rest of the world reeled from the real pandemic.The show, whose title is a play on “slow burn”, tells the story of how life on a fictitious island of the same name descends into chaos and destruction as the virus takes hold.The islanders are advised to wear face masks and practice social distancing. Quarantine rules are introduced, and conspiracy theories abound over the origins of the outbreak.The show’s creators have described it as “a post-apocalyptic disaster thriller merged into a modern epic” that explores “what happens to modern people when the thin varnish of our civilisation collapses”. It was nearly pulled after bosses at broadcaster ZDF expressed concern it might be too close to reality for viewers to cope with.“The question was whether we could ask of our audiences to watch it right now,” writer and director Christian Alvart told journalists ahead of broadcast.Alvart, who consulted virologists and emergency service personnel to find out what Germany’s preparations were in case of a deadly pandemic, said he had been inspired by the thought that disasters “mainly happen elsewhere”, and wondered how it would it be if one was to strike closer to home.“I had been amazed how we constantly hear about catastrophes in the world through the media but usually our lives just continue as normal,” he said.When Germany was put into lockdown, the series was in post-production. “It sent shivers down my spine, knowing what we’d filmed in the previous year,” Alvart said.German TV critics have been gently mocking of the series, which was filmed on the German East Frisian island of Nordeney and the Polish coastal resort, Sopot, in late 2019.“Not very subtle,” was Der Spiegel’s verdict, in a possible reference one of the symptoms of the disease: the secretion of blood from eye sockets. Süddeutsche Zeitung said the show would have been “a run of the mill horror and catastrophe film” if not for the fact that “one is constantly reminded of the real news of the last few months”. Die Zeit described it as the “reluctant coronavirus series, the fictional accompaniment to the reality of the last few months”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/692ae140fee4ff039da0c577f384f214f1d7bc6b/0_0_2939_1763/master/2939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5bc4213cd3002c4175e5db4886b5b9c","title":"dads a dictator anything goes with mum how masks and distancing rules are dividing britain","story":"What do you do when your loved ones flout the law – or nag you about going out? As lockdown eases, attitudes to Covid-19 seem more polarised than everMichael, a 35-year-old university lecturer from Sheffield, barely speaks to his brother nowadays. For years, they had been drifting apart over political differences such as Brexit. “He hates my leftwing, liberal beliefs as much as I hate his way of looking at the world,” Michael says. “We used have a pint together occasionally, or go to a match.” But coronavirus was the final straw.Even before masks became mandatory in English shops, Michael always wore a face covering when he went shopping and did his best to maintain social distancing. His brother did not. “He says he doesn’t care if he gets Covid-19 and has flouted all the rules,” says Michael. “He loves the conspiracy theories that it came from a Wuhan lab, or that it doesn’t really exist. I am incensed by his selfish and unthinking approach.”Almost 150 miles to the south, the pandemic is putting another family under strain. Beth, 76, lives alone in Slough, Berkshire. “I have not seen friends as much as I would normally,” she says. “Once a week, I’ll walk with a friend. I meet others in our gardens. My son, however, thinks that I should not leave the house or meet with friends or do click-and-collect orders from shops. He thinks that he is looking after me. I think that he is being patronising and treating me as a senile idiot who is incapable of managing her own life.”Arguments such as these are very common, according to the family therapist Kitty Hagenbach, who has seen demand for her services soar during lockdown. “Even in ordinary times, a great amount of discord is from everybody thinking they know better, or how anybody else should live,” she says. With the stakes as high as they are, coronavirus has only made that worse.It does not help that mixed messages – on everything from masks to public transport – are coming out of Westminster or that different rules apply in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, high-profile refuseniks such as the journalist James Delingpole are posting photos or videos of themselves flouting the law about wearing masks.John, 46, a computer programmer from Somerset, says that social distancing has been a “big, troubling issue” for his family – in particular, trying to “rein in” his 16-year-old daughter’s urge to socialise. “My daughter’s friends seem to have far more freedom than her and have been going out for weeks,” he says. She understands that there must be limits on her freedom because her two brothers have health conditions that increase their vulnerability to Covid-19, but she struggles to understand why politicians would ease lockdown if it was not safe.“We try to explain that there are political reasons and that’s why we won’t be easing lockdown as quickly as the government is encouraging. But it isn’t a recipe for happiness – and a teenage mind is not always logical.”“Families aren’t used to being together all the time,” Hagenbach says. “And some children are quite frightened about what’s going on and what’s happened to the world. That doesn’t mean children should make inidual choices. Parents still need to take charge. But whether the science says you must stay in or you can go out, it all has an emotional and psychological impact.”Alexandra, a 31-year-old medical researcher, lives in Liverpool with her husband. They have been extra cautious, as her husband previously had heart disease. “Most of our family have been very respectful and observant. However, my dad and his wife just want to follow whatever Boris Johnson does as soon as any restrictions are lifted, they think we are hypochondriacs for maintaining stricter rules,” she says.“When our baby was born, family and friends came to the window to safely view her. My dad and his wife didn’t think it was worth the trip and decided to wait until Johnson lifted the restrictions. But we don’t trust him or his government.”Alexandra says that, as a scientist, she has been able to understand the data and research herself, but that her relatives don’t respect her wishes – “or if they do, they will do so reluctantly”.Similarly, Amina Minhas, 34, a nurse in London, has stuck to “science and fact” in her approach, which involves masks, visors and gloves, even when relatives disagree. “The rifts have arisen from different interpretations of easing of lockdown rules,” she says. “Some are continuing to socially distance for the foreseeable future and others listen to the advice of Johnson, and so believe that is an extreme view.” But despite the contention, Minhas says her family have remained close. “Lockdown has made everyone appreciate each other a lot more and has really demonstrated how precious life is and how quickly things can change.”Prof Edward Cartwright and John Rose from De Montfort University in Leicester have been studying attitudes toward lockdown. They have found that women are more likely to comply with rules than men, as are people aged 60 or older. This may be because older people know that they are more vulnerable to the virus. “But we didn’t see a young-person effect,” Cartwright says. “There’s a belief that young people were more likely to break the lockdown, but we didn’t see that in our research.”What they did find was that people whose relationships or health had been strained were more likely to break lockdown, as were those with a key worker in their home. “My take on that is that if you’re living with someone who is ‘breaking’ the rules anyway – because they’re a key worker – you’re as good as going out, too,” Cartwright says. Cartwright and Rose also noted an uptick in people saying they would break lockdown because they did not agree with it in the week that headlines were dominated by Dominic Cummings’s trip to Barnard Castle in County Durham.Andrew, 68, a gardener in Sussex, is old enough that you might expect him to worry about coronavirus. But he takes a fatalistic line. “Everybody’s got to die of something,” he says. He does not wear a mask and says that social distancing is a “load of nonsense. If people want to stay indoors and lock themselves up, then cool. But I don’t.” He believes that the response to Covid-19 is “overstated” and that the virus is “like flu”.He says that people are not seeing the bigger picture by focusing so much on Covid-19. “People need to think about mental health. Domestic violence is on the up. People aren’t going to the hospital to get treatment they really need because they’re afraid of the virus.”Why is he not afraid? “I keep a healthy lifestyle. I’m a vegetarian and I’m out gardening, so I get plenty of vitamin D. If I get the virus, so be it. But I am not intending to sort of crouch down and be timid.”For the most part, Andrew says his family and friends feel the same where they don’t, he is always respectful, understanding that they “do it with good reason”, such as having a health condition. He says he always keeps a distance when asked and in shops. “I’m a happy, easy-going person and I respect the different opinions this has brought to the surface.”Leyla El-Moudden, 38, takes the opposite approach to masks and distancing. She is the head of marketing and education at a health brand that specialises in nutritional supplements she works primarily with immunocompromised people. Although she was initially “blase” about wearing a mask because she was “maintaining a healthy immunity through nutrients, herbs and lifestyle”, she now wears one outside at all times, as do her husband and children. “My kids” – who are eight and four – “are proud of themselves and feel like they are being little superheroes.”What made her change her mind about masks? The way that Covid-19 struck “terror” into the hearts of some of her immunocompromised clients. “They are terrified to go outside and panic at the sight of unmasked people. I ordered masks the same week I spoke to three clients who either had cancer or were caring for someone with it. It really hit me, what immunocompromised people are going through. The mask is not just for us, but for others.”“Then there are my brothers, who have been weekend pub visitors my stepdad, who forgets a pandemic is happening and my stepmum, who berates everyone she sees outside on social media from her privileged position of a large house in the countryside.”Like many people, Katie says she is “somewhere in the middle. I have been really anxious and suffered the occasional panic attack, but also I believe that some evaluated risks are worth taking to see family.” But, in the end, faced with navigating all those familial differences, she says it is “easier just to stick to myself in my London flat”.For all the arguments about science and policy, there will be many more that come down to hurt feelings – and the subtext that relatives are using Covid-19 as an excuse. It is something that Reg, 35, a London-based art director, admits to. “I am strict when it suits me,” he says. “I love to say to my partner: ‘Oh, sorry, I would hang in the park with your friends, but I can’t because of Covid.’ Coronavirus is a great cover for misanthropic tendencies.”Is there a silver lining to lockdown and the unease over its relaxation? Yes, says Hagenbach. “We’re seeing people take more responsibility for the family life – children especially. A lot of modern kids are very spoiled,” she says. “But this has been an opportunity for people to come together, work together and realise that life takes a lot of effort. It’s down to how well families communicate with each other and how well they allow the other people to have their own independent feelings. You can’t all feel the same as a family.”Some names and details have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c835607a0c1aaffbc5dc959d5dc9331ca0ce9f1/0_348_5252_3153/master/5252.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=febfcfe0501c895486e0b15737be871a","title":"tuesday briefing eight out of work for each job vacancy","story":"Employers and recruiters swamped with applications … Najib guilty in Malaysia 1MDB fraud trial … and row over gold mine in Northern IrelandHello, I’m Warren Murray and here’s the top line for this morning.The number of people claiming unemployment benefits per job vacancy in Britain has increased fivefold since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, according to an employment thinktank. The Institute for Employment Studies (IES) says approximately eight people are claiming benefits support for every job opening, an increase from 1.5 people per job before the crisis began in March. Paid employment in Britain has fallen almost 650,000 employees since March – here are examples of businesses and recruitment agencies inundated with applications.Thousands more holidays are set to be cancelled after the UK government’s recommendation against all but essential travel to mainland Spain was extended to include the Canary and Balearic islands.

More coronavirus developments at our global live blog – in our latest wrap, the World Health Organization chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned that the pandemic continues to accelerate, with the number of cases worldwide doubling in the past six weeks, nearly six months after it declared a “public health emergency of international concern”.Judgment falls on Najib – The Malaysian former prime minister Najib Razak has been found guilty on seven charges in his first trial linked to the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal – a case seen as a test of the country’s fight against corruption. Najib denied any wrongdoing in relation to what is one of the world’s biggest financial frauds, in which billions of dollars were allegedly looted from a state fund set up to promote development. The huge financial web led to investigations around the world. Najib has vowed to appeal.‘Cycling revolution’ – Residents will be able to banish through-traffic from local streets and councils will be prevented from building substandard cycle lanes under what Downing Street has billed as a revolution for cycling and walking in England. A watchdog will ensure new cycle and walking routes are up to standard – Active Travel England, with its own commissioner for walking and cycling, will refuse to fund paint-only bike lanes without physical protection from cars, or routes where cyclists and pedestrians have to share space. It could cut budgets in other areas for highways departments that fail to deliver on active transport. Boris Johnson will formally launch the initiative today. Peter Walker, who has been known to turn a pedal, says the scheme will be welcomed but transforming our transport habits is likely to take decades.Lower paid lose out in work stakes – The gender ide between paid and unpaid weekly work hours has decreased since the mid-1970s, according to a thinktank, but remains significant. The Resolution Foundation says women have increased their paid work by five hours and 18 minutes to 22 hours, while reducing unpaid hours – such as cooking, cleaning and caring for children – by two hours and 44 minutes to 29 hours. Men have reduced paid hours by eight hours and 10 minutes to 34 hours, while increasing unpaid hours by five hours and 35 minutes to 16 hours. The report highlights a “new ide” between households, with women in high-income households having the biggest increase in paid work. But the fall in paid work among men has mostly been in low-income households where one in seven workers want an increase in their hours. George Bangham, economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “A worrying new ‘working time inequality’ has emerged, with low-income households working far fewer hours per week than high-income ones.”Bushfires’ huge wildlife toll – Nearly 3 billion animals were killed or displaced by Australia’s bushfire season of 2019 and 2020, according to scientists. An estimated 143 million mammals, 180 million birds, 51 million frogs and a staggering 2.5 billion reptiles were either killed or died subsequently of starvation, dehydration and predation by feral animals – mostly cats. An interim report based on work by 10 scientists from five institutions, commissioned by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), suggests the toll from the fires goes much further than an earlier estimate of more than a billion animals killed.Iran prison ordeal worsens – The British-Australian academic Kylie Moore-Gilbert, who was given a 10-year-prison sentence in Iran for alleged espionage, has been moved to a remote prison called Qarchak that is notorious for violence and reportedly stricken with coronavirus.The Cambridge-educated Middle East scholar had been held in Tehran’s Evin prison for nearly two years before her sudden move three days ago. No evidence has ever been publicly presented of Moore-Gilbert’s alleged crimes. She was arrested and tried in secret after being invited to Iran to speak at an academic conference.Fresh primed – Amazon is to press ahead with the wider UK rollout of its online grocery service by the end of the year.

There are also concerns that masks could affect communication in classes.However, with face coverings now mandatory in enclosed public spaces across England, including inside shops and on public transport, unions say the current policy in schools is out of step with wider public health policy, and they want teachers and school staff to have the same protection as other workers.With masks also compulsory for children over the age of 11 in enclosed public spaces, the NASUWT teaching union believes there is now a strong case for wearing them to be made compulsory for older children when they return to school in September.“The government’s wider public health advice confirms that whilst children aged under 11 are not required to wear face masks, they are mandatory for children aged over 11 when they visit a range of other facilities,” said the NASUWT’s general secretary, Dr Patrick Roach. “So there is a strong argument that face masks should also be made compulsory for children when they return to secondary schools in September.”Some schools are already taking the matter into their own hands. Neil Strowger, the chief executive officer of the Bohunt education trust, which has eight schools in Hampshire, said: “We are encouraging our community to wear masks inside, as there is evidence to support their use, but we are clear that students and staff are not required to wear them.”Dr David Strain, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School and the co-chair of the medical academic staff committee of the British Medical Association (BMA), did not advocate face masks in primary schools but agreed that masks for teenagers in secondary school – in situations where they could not keep their distance – were a sensible precaution.The BMA, which is one of the top representative bodies for doctors, has said that wherever 2-metre social distancing cannot be observed, including in schools, masks should be worn as a way of limiting transmission.“When it comes to teenagers in secondary school, they are very unlikely to be badly affected by Covid, but there is some evidence that they can be carriers and spread it on,” said Strain. “Therefore the idea of them wearing masks to stop spread around the school – enabling them to potentially take it home to older relatives and also risking teachers – is a sensible precaution.”Julie McCulloch, the director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said masks were already in use in schools in some other countries. “We expect that most schools will follow the existing guidance, although some may decide to use face coverings as an extra level of assurance.”Karen Leonard, a national officer at the GMB union, added: “GMB’s position is to allow school staff to wear masks if they want to. Staff who may be vulnerable or at increased risk should not be prevented from wearing them.”Avis Gilmore, the deputy general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “It remains our view that no member of staff or pupil should be prevented from wearing a face mask if they wish to do so and we anticipate that the majority of schools and colleges will respect this.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We have set out the controls schools should use, including cleaning and hygiene measures, to substantially reduce the risk of transmission of the virus when they open to all children from September.“This does not include the wearing of face coverings as we believe the system of controls laid out adequately reduced the risk of transmission to both staff and students.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Call for donor countries to build climate change resilience into Covid-19 recovery plansS\u0026atildeo Paulo Letter: Jungle destruction prompts global pressure but makes little impactEcocide \u0026ndash the deliberate destruction of ecosystems \u0026ndash must be seen as the worst crime against humanity and nature"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needs"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Image: iStockA HSE employee received their monthly pay every fortnight for almost six months, resulting in an overpayment of more than € 40,500, an internal audit has found.The details of the error are included in a review of payroll overpayments within the HSE West community healthcare organisation for SligoLeitrim and Donegal, published on Monday.The audit states that between October 3rd 2006 and May 9th 2016, the employee worked in a cost centre which paid monthly. The inidual was then rehired in a different cost centre in June of that year, which paid fortnightly.However, the employee’s rate of pay was not changed, resulting in their total monthly wage being paid out every fortnight, the audit states.This discrepancy occurred for a six month period – between June 12th 2016 and December 11th 2016 – resulting in an overpayment of €40,535.33.The internal audit found that the overpayment was highlighted on a “payroll exception report”, prior to each payroll run, which indicated that the gross pay for the employee “exceeded the maximum pay for the gradewage type by 150 per cent”.However “during all of this time” the error was not identified by management as part of their monthly budget controls, the audit states.The employee is repaying € 100 per fortnight since January 23rd 2017, and payroll debtors reports indicated that the overpayment balance was reduced to € 31,235 by November 2018.The total amount of outstanding overpayments in the SligoLeitrim and Donegal HSE care area was €260,709 on November 30th 2018, consisting of a total of 129 overpayment balances, the report states.The audit examined a sample of 12 of those balances, representing 70 per cent of the total value of overpayments, and selected across mental health, primary care and social care services.The report identified several ways in which the overpayments arose, including HR or payroll forms not being submitted, or submitted too late, pension related deductions (PRD) not being deducted from the employee’s pay and the incorrect PRSI class rates being applied.The audit also found that the recoupment of overpayments is not being effectively managed. Currently five out of 12 of the sample are not being recouped so there is a risk that they may be non-recoverable, the report said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Good-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state media\u0026lsquoWhy are they playing Radiohead?

Photograph:   Robert PerryPA WireBritain’s refusal to compromise on fisheries and level playing field guarantees of fair competition have made a trade agreement unlikely, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said on Thursday. Speaking at the end of a round of talks in London, Mr Barnier said that although there was some progress in certain areas there was none on the key issue of a level playing field on state aid.“By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely,” he said.Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost blamed the EU, asserting that its proposals did not respect the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a meeting with the presidents of the EU institutions last month.“Considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas, that is, the so-called level playing field and on fisheries.\u0026nbspWe have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period,” he said.Mr Frost said the EU had listened to Britain’s concerns about the role of the European Court of Justice in any future agreement and Britain has dropped its demand for a complex suite of separate agreements like those the EU has with Switzerland. However, the issue of state aid remains a stumbling block, and Mr Barnier complained on Thursday that Britain had not yet published details of the state aid regime it plans to introduce from January next year.“We have no visibility on the UK’s intention on its future domestic subsidy control regime. We respect the UK political debate but the time for answers is quickly running out,” he said.A senior British official close to the talks dismissed Mr Barnier’s demand for details of the state aid regime, and said Britain would not commit to any regime as part of its treaty with the EU.“We’re a bit puzzled by this, to be honest, because we don’t quite see why. What is significant about the subsidy regime compared to lots of other areas of domestic policy? “They aren’t asking us to pre-publish in these areas or to kind of pre-commit to future agreements forever in the treaty. And we don’t really see why this is the case either in this area. All we need is a mechanism to resolve disputes between you if there are felt to be unfair subsidies,” the official said.“We’re not going to pre-commit to a particular kind of regime in the treaty with the EU. That’s just not how we’re going to do things.” Second referendumDuring a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Mr Johnson was met by protesters calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence. During a visit to Orkney and the north of Scotland, the prime minister said the response to the coronavirus had shown the strength of the union.However, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon , who has won praise for her handling of the pandemic, said Mr Johnson should not be exploiting it to make a political point.“I don’t think any of us should be championing or celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political case we want to make. This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we’re not out of yet. Too many people died,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

The Church confirmed it was reviewing the complaint.The man says that Archbishop Welby failed to refer the abuse directly to social services and the police, in breach of church guidelines.Archbishop Welby has always insisted he knew nothing of the allegations until 2013 when the church referred them to the police.But last night, Channel 4 news reported that the Church is investigating a formal complaint it received last month that the Archbishop failed to act appropriately on the allegations made against Smyth.In a statement, the Church of England said: “It is in the public domain that when Lambeth was contacted in 2013 about an allegation against Smyth it liaised with the relevant diocese. This was to ensure that the survivor was being supported, police had been informed and that the bishop had contacted the Bishop of Cape Town, where Smyth was then living.“However, since a formal complaint has now been received by the National Safeguarding Team, it is reviewing information and will obviously respond on this to the person who brought the complaint and take any further action if needed.“These issues will all be considered by the Makin Review which the Church commissioned last year into the Smyth case and is expected to publish into 2021.”In 2017 Bishop of Guildford revealed that he was one of 22 young men abused by Mr Smyth, who is accused of savagely beating beatings boys he met at Christian holiday camps in the late Seventies.The Right Rev Andrew Watson said: “The beating I endured in the infamous garden shed was violent, excruciating and shocking but it was thankfully a one-off experience never to be repeated.”An open letter to the Most Rev Welby, endorsed by eight alleged victims of John Smyth QC, calls on the Archbishop to come clean about the extent of his knowledge of the abuse claims.Archbishop Welby, who worked as a dormitory officer on camps run the Iwerne Trust, which Mr Smyth chaired from 1974 to 1981, has insisted he was “completely unaware” of the claims against the part-time judge until 2013.Mr Smyth died in 2018.When confronted over the allegations by Channel 4 in 2017, he said: “I’m not talking about what we did at all”.He called some of the claims nonsense and declined to respond to further requests.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"over eaters like dont need pm tell us live healthier life","story":"My epiphany arrived courtesy of a late-night train arriving in Glasgow Central station after a long journey from London. I happened to glance at my reflection in the window of my carriage and what I saw shocked me.I had known for years that I was not at my ideal weight. My height – I’m six feet four inches – usually successfully disguised the extent of how overweight I was. But there was no disguising the fact that the man in the window reflection on that February evening was fat. Obese, even. The next day I weighed myself on my rarely-used bathroom scales. Nineteen stones and one pound. Gosh.And so I embarked on a new regime. I despise the idea of diets, which I consider a futile and self-defeating exercise. Diets are, by their nature, temporary. And when they end, as they must, any weight lost is gained again over time. So what was required was a permanent change in lifestyle, a change that could be sustained over the very long term.My great weakness is sweets. It was a common practice to open a bag of Thornton’s toffee and consume the lot in a single sitting. In my younger days, when my metabolism was working at full throttle, before it decided on its “go slow” policy, I could (and did) buy a box of four Mars Bar ice cream bars and scoff the lot in a single afternoon. Good times.So that was the first and most difficult change: no more sweets. No more selecting a chocolate bar to munch while watching TV at night. Fruit only from now on. The other change was to cut out all snacking between meals. It’s only since I did so that I realised that many of us are privileged enough to know very little of what being hungry actually means.We tend to equate being in the mood for a snack with hunger. Until the last few months, I rarely allowed my appetite to go unsated for any period. Whereas now, by the time my main evening meal is ready, I’m genuinely ravenous, in a healthy, undramatic way. And I enjoy that meal far more than I did before.The last change is also difficult for me and, I guess, for most people: I spend half an hour each week day (I still enjoy weekends off) on the exercise bike, which is made more palatable by being able to catch up on some of my favourite TV comedies while I sweat: I’ve watched all ten seasons of Curb Your Enthusiasm and have started a marathon rewatch of Veep. The result? The last time I weighed myself I was down to 16 stone, nine pounds – a loss of nearly two and a half stones since February.My new regime began before the Covid crisis, but my awareness of the part played by obesity in recovery and fatality rates helped keep me on course these last four months. The prime minister’s personal harrowing experience with the virus confirmed my resolution to stay on that downward trajectory. I’m only half way to my target weight, but at least I’m no longer technically obese, according to the Body Mass Index – merely overweight.This is not one of those lifestyle pieces in which I evangelise my method of weight loss it would be wrong for me to suggest that my personal experience is anything other than that, that it can be applied to anyone else. But the government’s reported plans to tackle the “obesity crisis” on our behalf leaves me concerned. First of all, my being overweight is my own responsibility (and again allow me to remind readers I am talking about myself only).I am intelligent enough to be aware that the lifestyle choices I have made as an adult have been directly responsible for my physical condition. I cannot blame the government for my size when I am the one who has chosen to eat more fish suppers and chocolate than salads and fruit. No one forced me to choose a particular diet and no one pretended that pizza is a health food. Are there lots of other people who have been deceived, either by the government or by the food industry, into believing that eating at McDonald’s every night has no medical consequences? Unlikely.The problem with any government seeking to combat the “obesity crisis” by banning fast food advertising is that it allows the rest of us to ask, “Why haven’t you done this before now?” And it allows us to draw the conclusion that our physical size, our consciously poor decisions about what to order in restaurants and to cook at home, is someone else’s – namely the government’s – fault and not ours. Which means that the responsibility for losing weight is no longer ours either.But here’s the thing: it is my responsibility. The notion that an advertising ban is necessary is predicated on the patronising assumption that TV viewers and consumers are just not adult or intelligent enough to work out what’s bad for them, that they need ministers to choose their evening meal for them. Maybe some do – as I say, this is a personal perspective – but I can say without doubt that I do not require Boris Johnson’s advice on how to live a healthier lifestyle, however well-meaning he is.The irony, of course, is that the prime minister himself got the message (in the most harrowing way possible) that he needed to lose weight, and he did so without requiring unhealthy food adverts to be banned from the TV screens in Downing Street. If only he had enough confidence to believe that the rest of the population can be trusted to take similar control of our own lives.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry reluctant accept royal family trial separation","story":"The Duke of Sussex was reluctant to accept a 12-month trial separation from the Royal family it has emerged, in the wake of the continuing fallout from a controversial new biography.The Duke and Duchess quit Royal family duties at the start of the year, decamping first to Canada and then to California, but the situation remains under a year-long review.Royal sources have suggested the new biography, which detailed their rift with the monarchy, has scuppered any chance of the couple returning to the UK at the end of the trial separation.However, separate sources have told The  that Prince Harry had been reluctant to agree to the review in the first place because the couple knew they never wanted to return to the old way of doing things. “The split was very stressful for everyone on all sides,” said a Palace insider, “but the Duke and Duchess were never going to go back to the status quo. Harry needed to be convinced of the purpose for a review. Theirs is a new model and they never wanted to go back to the old one, even if they do come back to the UK.“The review is intended to keep the door open to them but Harry could see the down side of this because this wasn’t about them changing their minds.”The new biography – Finding Freedom – retells the events leading up to the decision by Harry and Meghan to leave the UK and give up their regular duties in an attempt to strike out commercially and pay their own way.Their bills for their security detail are no longer paid for by the UK taxpayer and the politan Police does not provide officers to guard them at their home in Los Angeles.Finding Freedom alleged that the Duke believed that the “old guard” at Buckingham Palace disliked Meghan and wanted to make her life difficult.The couple have insisted they offered no interviews for the biography’s authors nor contributed to it. The biography also alleged that the rift between Harry and his brother the Duke of Cambridge was sparked by William questioning Harry’s relationship with Meghan. It is claimed that William told Harry: “Take as much time as you need to get to know this girl.” Harry believed the comment was “snobbish”.The 12-month review was suggested as part of negotiations to keep the door open for the couple. It allowed Prince Harry to hold on to some patronages and titles, said insiders, which in turn allows him to maintain his links with the UK.The pair had been expected back for major events such as Trooping the Colour but those plans have been scuppered by the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a source close to the Sussexes. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"put less weight gcse results flexible admit students sixth forms","story":"Schools have been told to put “less weight” on GCSE results this year when admitting pupils into sixth forms, in the first admission that this summer’s grades may be untrustworthy. Head teachers should offer “greater flexibility” to students who have not got the grades they require to take certain A-levels, according to the exam regulator. If a student has not achieved the GCSE results they need to secure a place at a sixth form, schools could “put slightly less weight on the one or two lower grades” when deciding whether or not to admit them. In a letter to head teachers, Sally Collier, Ofqual’s chief regulator, said that schools should look at other evidence such as a student’s “potential” rather than grades alone. Schools could also give “slightly more weight than usual” to a pupil’s reference from their previous school which could be considered alongside their grades. Experts noted that the letter marks a “change in tone” for Ofqual, which has previously insisted that this year’s results will be just as valid as other years. “I think it’s a concession that the process has been different this year, and therefore that some allowance ought to be made,” said Dr Tony Breslin, a former chief examiner. “Ofqual are giving a licence to schools to be flexible, which is something they can do anyway but, of course, it carries more weight when the regulator says it.” Dennis Sherwood, a consultant who has carried out research for Ofqual on exam grades, said that the letter “really does mark a change in tone”. He said this is a “much more honest, more realistic” approach to take as it shows that grades are “merely an indicator as opposed to being a black-and-white determinate”. Ms Collier also used the letter to warn that teachers will be investigated for potential malpractice if they tell students or parents predicted GCSE and A-level grades, or rank orders, ahead of results day. “This is to protect the integrity of the grading process, and to avoid you and your staff being put under pressure. Since the final grades for some or all students in a centre could be different from those submitted, it also helps to manage students’ expectations,” she explained. Hundreds of thousands of students will receive their A-level and GCSE results next month, despite all exams being axed this year. Ofqual has promised that “no child will be penalised” by this year’s system and that all exam grades will be as fair and valid as those in previous years. But head teachers have warned that this will be a year in which some pupils are “bound to feel victims in a process which is not of their own making”. A statistical model will be used to calculate the majority of pupils’ results this summer. An analysis by Ofqual, published earlier this week, found that teachers bumped up predicted A-level marks by 12 per cent on average and GCSE marks by 9 per cent. The watchdog said it was “not surprising” that grades predicted by teachers were optimistic since teachers “naturally want to do their best for their students”.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"virus has taken liberty must take humanity","story":"All our current debates about lockdowns, social distancing and masks ultimately end up with one uncomfortable dilemma. Do we get on with our lives and put up with Covid-19? Or do we try to hide away from the risk of infection in the hope that one day it will go away?Let us remind ourselves of how we got here. The Government was panicked into imposing a lockdown in March by Professor Neil Ferguson’s Imperial College modelling report. The report is notorious for predicting a “reasonable worst-case scenario” of 510,000 deaths. But it made another important point which is often overlooked. A lockdown would only save a significant number of lives if it was kept in place indefinitely, until there was a vaccine, “which could be 18 months or more”. Otherwise, the virus would simply rebound, probably worse than ever, after it was lifted.Professor Ferguson’s team had previously put the point like this. Aggressive isolation policies “merely push all transmission to the period after they are lifted, giving a delay but no substantial reduction in either peak incidence or overall attack rate”. The current spikes in countries that have lifted lockdowns, such as Spain, Germany, Japan and Hong Kong, bear this out. Some of them had longer and stricter lockdowns than we did.It follows that, as far as the lockdown was concerned, there were only ever three coherent options. Option one was to have no lockdown. Option two was to have an indefinite lockdown, putting our whole national life into cold storage for the duration at unimaginable cost. Option three, which the Government chose, was to have a lockdown for long enough to allow the intensive care capacity of the NHS to catch up. In the event it caught up within a month.The Government lifted the lockdown in June, six to eight weeks after it had lost any justification even by its own logic. But let us declare a truce on whether it was imposed too early or lifted too late. The question now is what happens next.The Government’s position appears to be that the famous R-number can be kept below 1 without a lockdown but with social distancing. Some epidemiologists agree with this. Others do not. I do not propose to venture into those murky waters. But assuming that the Government is right, there are some awkward issues to be confronted.One is that if the R-number can be kept below 1 with social distancing alone, then we could have done it in March instead of locking down. This is not hindsight. It is what Sweden did. It is fashionable to rubbish the Swedish approach. But their deaths per million of population are substantially lower than ours. Their hospitals were never overwhelmed. They never closed their schools. The predicted damage to their economy is about half of ours.The most awkward question, however, is about the exit route. Assuming that social distancing can keep transmission of the disease low, it has to be kept in place indefinitely until there is a vaccine. What does this mean for our world?Physical proximity to other people is not some sort of optional extra which can be ironed out of our culture. It is fundamental to our humanity. Conversation round a table, friendship, love and tears, children at play, most educational activity, depend on physical proximity. Our whole transport infrastructure, the buildings in which we work, play and eat out, depend on our being close together. With social distancing, physical cooperation becomes impossible. The social dimension of work all but disappears. The House of Commons, a great national forum in the crowded chamber, is reduced to a poor phone-in programme in a half-empty space. With social distancing there is no crowd around the bar, no singing at weddings, no orchestras or choirs, no theatre, no sport, no live audiences – in short, no collective activities, only the dismal solitude of the electronic screen. We have surrendered our liberty to the virus. Are we to surrender our humanity as well?Masks, by comparison, are a minor issue. They are uncomfortable and depersonalising. They conflict with a basic instinct of Western society to interact visually, showing our faces. But if they encourage people to come out and live together again or to send their children to school, that can only be good. People will soon tire of them.The brutal reality is the same, masks or no masks. We are going to have to live with Covid-19 whether we like it or not, unless and until there is an effective vaccine. And not just with Covid-19.Shocking? Perhaps. But only because in Europe we have had a false sense of security for so long. In the last two decades there have been Mers and Sars. Before that there were Asian flu, Hong Kong flu, H1N1, and non-respiratory epidemic diseases like HIV, Ebola and Zika. All of them had higher case mortality than Covid-19. But, apart from HIV, they barely touched Europe.This seems likely to change. International movement of people and other organisms is increasing. A major UK pandemic has been top of the National Risk Register since it was first published in 2008. It estimates that a new strain of flu could cause between 50,000 and 750,000 additional deaths in the UK and that emerging diseases, usually originating in animals, are a growing threat whose impact is unpredictable but may be very high.Covid-19 is a serious disease, but historically it is at the bottom end of the scale. For any one under 50 the risk of death is tiny, less than for seasonal flu. In the great majority of cases the symptoms are mild or non-existent. Our ancestors lived with far worse epidemic diseases without rushing to put their heads in a bag. In other parts of the world they still do (world-wide, tuberculosis kills many more than Covid-19).We all need to make our own personal risk assessments in the light of our age and state of health and the sort of activities in which we engage. For some people, social distancing will remain a sensible precaution. The rest of us should respect their choice but drop it and get on with our lives.

Prof Yuen said he immediately informed Beijing.The revelation contradicts China’s official version of events, where Beijing claims it made a public announcement about the human transmission as soon as it had clear evidence.Public confirmation of human to human transmission of a mysterious SARS-like virus did not emerge from the Chinese health ministry until January 19, just as the country was entering its busiest annual travel period of the year, when millions board trains and planes for the Lunar New Year holidays. Prof Yuen told Panorama: “The local officials who were supposed to be immediately relaying the information had not allowed this to be done as rapidly as it should.“I do suspect that they have been doing some cover-up locally at Wuhan,” he said.“When we went to the Huanan Seafood Market, of course there is nothing to see because the market was clean already. So, you may say that the crime scene is already disturbed.The World Health Organisation, which sent a delegation to Wuhan on January 20-21, issued a statement on January 22 saying human to human transmission is taking place in Wuhan” and the authorities enforced a draconian lockdown of the entire city. However, 5 million residents had already left.As soon as he suspected the virus could be transmitted between humans, Prof Yuen also urged the Hong Kong government to take public health precautions.His claims were backed earlier this year by experts in nearby Taiwan, who also took strict virus prevention measures weeks before the Chinese lockdown after spotting social media posts from the medical community in Wuhan on December 31 about suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.Chuang Yin-ching, a senior official working for Taiwan’s Centres for Disease Control, one of a handful of infectious disease experts briefed in Wuhan from January 13-15, told the  that a Beijing official admitted then that “limited human to human transmission cannot be excluded.”Both testimonies dovetail with an Associated Press story in April, based on internal documents, that top Chinese officials had determined they were facing a pandemic from a new coronavirus six days before warning the public. Some 3,000 people are believed to have been infected during the week of silence. Some experts believe global chaos could have been averted if action had been taken sooner.Prof Yuen said: “I know how efficient the virus was spreading and I know that it is acquired in hospital and I know that it can go with people by flights from one city, thousands of miles away. There is one thing that I learned. If you don’t make use of every hour, you are in big, big trouble.”Lord Patten, former Governor of Hong Kong told Panorama: Frankly thousands of people will have lost their lives and livelihoods because China did not behave as it promised it would behave according to the international health regulations.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"must slim many nurses fat","story":"Shortly after reading Matt Hancock’s article about combatting obesity in yesterday’s paper, I emerged from a café to find my way virtually blocked by an enormously wide, youngish woman in a nurse’s uniform. It was a vivid reminder of a general fact about the National Health Service: many of its staff are fat.That matters, not only for the health of the NHS staff involved, but also for the effectiveness of any anti-obesity campaign. If the public are being urged to lose weight, they will not take the message seriously if they notice that a substantial proportion of those caring for them are not doing so. It reminds me of the days when lots of doctors still smoked.In his article, the Health Secretary also mentioned “stark inequalities in our nation’s health”. These are apparent within NHS staff. Sightings of fat NHS doctors are definitely unusual these days. Nurses and ancillary staff, on the other hand, are often disproportionately tubby.Why should this be? My guess is that the NHS, as a collectivity, is not a very health-conscious employer. What sort of food is served to hospital staff? Are they discouraged from eating too many American-style muffins? Certainly most hospital food for patients remains fattening and unappetising. Most hospital public coffee-shops groan under the weight of buns and fizzy drinks.The Government justifies an anti-obesity campaign partly in terms of the need to “help protect the health service”. As with its coronavirus slogan, this gets the problem back to front.Obviously, all citizens should behave well towards the public services. There is something even more disgusting, for example, about rioters who attack police and emergency services rather than just lamp-posts or one another. But the public do not exist to look after the NHS. The NHS exists to look after us.It will be an evil day if our defective lifestyle choices ever count against us when receiving medical treatment. When the AIDS epidemic began in the 1980s, one chief constable said that AIDS victims were “swirling around in a cesspool of their own making”. Even if this had been true, it would not have justified rationing or withholding their treatment. Motorcyclists and riders get more head injuries than the average. Drunks suffer from far more ailments than the sober.All of us, even the most virtuous, create work for the NHS simply by being alive, especially if we have the impertinence to get old. Don’t let’s go down the slippery slope of judging patients on their moral worth.The good reason for slimming is that you, and those dear to you, will usually have a happier and healthier life as a result. The message should be as simple as that.Last night’s BBC Panorama programme, China’s Coronavirus Cover-up, laid out the story efficiently. There can surely be no reasonable doubt that the Chinese Communist Party reacted slowly and mendaciously to the appearance of the virus. The results were literally fatal for thousands, arguably for hundreds of thousands all over the world. The programme brought this home.Two things, however, worried me. Both of them arose from the testimony of the programme’s star witness, Professor Kwok-Yung Yuen, who was part of the first delegation of external medical experts allowed to visit Wuhan.Professor Yuen spoke well and seemed wholly honourable, but it occurred to me that he might have fallen into a trap laid by the regime. He was told by the Wuhan authorities, he said, that the city’s wet market had been completely cleaned up before his arrival and that samples of only some of the animals there had been preserved. The implication, accepted by the programme, was that evidence of the disease’s origin had been erased.There is an alternative explanation. If it is true, as the scientists Angus Dalgleish and Birger Sorensen have posited in their learned paper on the subject (see this column, June 6) that the killer virus originated not in the market but in the Wuhan lab, then the reason for destroying much of the “evidence” from the wet market was not that the truth lay there, but that it did not. The Chinese wanted people to believe that the market contained something important, when actually it did not. You could put it thus: another creature from the animal kingdom, as well as bats and pangolins, had been available in the market – red herrings.My other doubt concerned Professor Yuen’s assertion that there had been “some cover-up locally”. I bet there was but surely the key point is that there was more than some cover-up nationally, at the highest level.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 28th july 2020","story":"A short-eared owl flying head on at a camera with its huge amber eyes looking straight down the lens, NorthumberlandCoronavirus latest news: Bikes on prescription as PM announces cycling revolution to combat obesityTuesday morning news briefing: Plan to cut Spanish quarantine to 10 daysComment: If we must be slim, why are so many nurses fat?Former Malaysian PM Najib Razak found guilty in corruption trialComment: We need an effective plan to beat obesityJed Mercurio: \u0026#39BBC has selective amnesia after turning down Line of Duty\u0026#39Women now doing twice as much unpaid work as men, despite total working hours being almost equalSky Arts becomes free-to-air channel as BBC Four fades awayOnline chats with friends and family improve older people\u0026#39s mental health, reveals UCL researchComment: Taxing the over-40s is not the way to address the problem of social careNew Zealand follows intelligence allies and suspends extradition treaty with Hong KongChinese authorities \u0026#39covered up\u0026#39 coronavirus cases in Wuhan and did not warn public of risk for a week, claims scientistWoman killed in shark attack in rare encounter off MaineToddler in hospital after falling from block of flats in East LondonForeign Office advises against all non-essential travel to Spain as cases jump by 6,000Bikes on prescription as Boris Johnson announces cycling revolution to combat obesityPut less weight on GCSE results and be more flexible, schools toldQuarantine to be cut to 10 days for people arriving from SpainScientists discover what makes body odour smell bad, and say it could help develop better antiperspirants Comment: The virus has taken our liberty.

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track. See explore-essex for details.Meet the kayaking instructor...Having been cooped up during lockdown, it’s safe to say that large numbers are wanting to experience the great outdoors like never before now businesses are reopening.“We\u0027ve been ridiculously busy,” says Adrian Fall, below, owner of Brighton-based The Kayak Coach. “People have been so excited about being on the water.”Fall\u0027s passion is teaching people how to kayak, canoe and paddleboard – then leading them on trips up Sussex\u0027s beautiful estuaries and rivers.He set up The Kayak Coach almost 12 years ago and has just taken on two extra staff to add to the three he already employs teaching and guiding on the water: “I love being outside and now\u0027s the time to meet people again and introduce them to the sport I love,” he says.Reopening the business required important changes, as per Government guidelines. Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And they warned that “the future of our party is at stake”.The Oxford West and Abingdon MP is currently the outsider in the race to succeed Jo Swinson against acting leader Sir Ed Davey, who won 1,870 nominations from members across 343 local parties, compared to her 1,329 nominations from 330 local groups.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut she is seeking to present herself as the candidate who can appeal to voters from both sides of the political ide by shedding the party’s “baggage” from the years of coalition with Tories, when Sir Ed was energy secretary in David Cameron’s cabinet.Signatories to the joint statement backing Moran include Julian Huppert and former equalities minister Lynne Featherstone, who lost their seats of Cambridge and Hornsey \u0026amp Wood Green respectively to Labour in 2015, along with Martin Horwood, who lost Cheltenham to the Conservatives the same year, and Stephen Lloyd, whose Eastbourne seat went to Tories last December.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Demonstrators protest outside the Tate Modern in London over proposed job losses in the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown.

To free ourselves from the baggage of coalition, to rebuild that crucial trust with the electorate we have lost.Wherever the Liberal Democrats should be now, it isn’t left of LabourLondon MP endorses Davey in Lib Dem leadership contestLib Dem leadership hopeful suggests she can free party from coalition “As former Liberal Democrat MPs, we represented seats in both Leave and Remain and Conservative and Labour-facing areas. We are convinced that electing Layla Moran as leader would be the best way to win these seats back. Because to win back former Liberal Democrat strongholds and become competitive again across the country, we need to build a broad base of support amongst voters. That means we need to send a clear message we are renewed as a party.“We must start listening to voters again, and show that we have learnt the lessons of the past decade. Layla Moran will provide the strong, liberal voice the party needs to cut through in the media and to stand out from the crowd.“Together we can build a progressive message that appeals to voters across the political spectrum, just like Paddy Ashdown and Charles Kennedy did.”Moran’s team pointed to the fact that both Eastbourne and Cheltenham are in the Lib Dems’ top 15 list of target seats for the 2024 general election.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Farron’s successor Sir Vince Cable is expected to remain neutral in the race, as is Ms Swinson, who stepped down from the leadership after losing her seat in December.Ms Moran said: I am delighted to have the support of former MPs who agree it\u0027s time we moved the party forward from the past decade.“Under my leadership, the Liberal Democrats can and will do better than our current 6 per cent in the polls. Together we can move on from the coalition, rebuild trust with voters and build a greener, fairer and more compassionate country.Online ballots are being sent out to Lib Dem members on 30 July, with voting closing on 26 August and the victor announced the following day.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But no one’s paying the slightest bit of attention.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesHand sanitiser  That’s what homeless people drink, isn’t it People roar up to me all the time, flinging their arms round my shoulders and asking for a selfie. And they look genuinely perplexed when I ask them politely to back up a bit.At the TV studios where I’m working, there’s a one-way system that’s not being used, electronic ­temper- ature checks that are covered in cobwebs and endless signs telling people to keep apart. Which no one can read because of the huddle they’re in.At breakfast in the hotel where I’m staying, no one’s wearing a mask and in the city’s restaurants it’s business as usual.The only slight change is that because so many are working from home, the girls have plenty of spare time to take off even more clothes than usual before going out.Face masks  Ha. You must be ­joking. They’re not wearing anything at all.The problem is that social distancing simply doesn’t work in the North, where people are naturally friendly. Asking a Manc to scuttle about with his head down and his eyes locked in the straight-ahead position is like asking a fish to tap-dance.They’re also a pretty sensible bunch. Did you know thatsomeone had the virus in March, and was killed last week by falling out of a tree, they are still chalked up as a “Covid death”  Well they do up here. They know that this pandemic is a wave that’s passed.In London and the South East, meanwhile, it’s a very dferent story. There are Covid Nazis at every turn, telling people to keep apart and everyone is happy to oblige.Face masks are everywhere and no one is punctual for their Zoom calls because they’ve just spent two hours washing their hands.There’s a simple reason for this. In London, no one has ever wanted to talk to their neighbour and now they have an excuse.The reaction to Covid is almost tailor-made for the capital. Because all the guidelines are basically giving people permission to do what they’ve always done.“What  No one is allowed to sit next to me on the Tube  Excellent.”On balance, I’ve got to say, I ­prefer it in Manchester.LAST autumn was the wettest for  years. The spring was the hottest and driest ever. And July is on course to be the coldest for  years.It seems that every single day a new weather record is broken, which suggests the climate is changing.Which makes me wonder. Why did no one see this coming Andthey did, why were they so quiet about it Yes, and now he’s the Democratic candidate in this year’s presidential elections.HAVING done Covid- vaccine tests on , ­volunteers, a team of ­British boffins in Oxford has announced that the initial results are “encouraging”.That’s pathetic. “Encouraging” is completely the wrong word. It’s what teachers write on a fat kid’s school report after he’s managed to come second to last in the  metres sack race.The fact is that Oxford is in a fight to develop this vaccine with an American biotech company, and you can be certain Hank won’t ever describe his progress as “encouraging”.He’s already said it’s “robust” and soon he’ll be saying his medicine “kicks ass” and that it’s “hammer time”. Evenit’s causing people’s penises to fall off.The British have always been good at understatement. I once saw survivors being interviewed after a tornado had ripped the heart out of a small town in Oklahoma in the US.The Americans were hysterical, sobbing and saying: “The wind speed was, like, , miles an hour and I saw God himself reach down and take our house.”Whereas a British man, visiting on business, said when the cameras were poked in his face that it had been “a trle breezy”.That was charming, but whoever develops a vaccine will bring billions into the country, so we don’t want charm. We want our scientists to develop an American gung-ho, up-and-at-’em attitude.They can start by dropping this “encouraging” nonsense and describing their results as “awesome”.This seemed odd, because fitting windows to a submarine is as daft as fitting a coffee machine to a duck.I therefore did some checking and it turns out they’re there so that when the sub is on the surface, the crew don’t have to go outside to see where they are going. Which means they won’t get cold.Diddums. And we thought these guys were tough.I’VE often wonderedit’s ­possible to put something into Google search engine and get no results at all.I’ve tried quite often with phrases like “Piers Morgan fans” or “Alicia Vikander ugly tree”.But I’ve never managed it.Well, this week I needed to attach a snow plough to the front of my tractor – don’t ask – and had no idea how it could be done.So I googled “Front linkage Lamborghini .R”.And there it was. “Your search did not match any ­documents”.WE learned this week that there’s been a  per cent surge in the sales of cassette tapes.Couple of points on that. First of all, why  The sound quality on a cassette is so bad that for many years I thought that the Bee Gees had done a song called Bald Headed Woman, that the Police had sung about Sue Lawley and that Desmond Dekker had been saying: “My ears are alight.”Point number two is: what happened to the massive collection of cassettes we all used to have in the Seventies They can’t all have ended up wrapped round single shoes on the motorway’s central reservation.That’ll give me something to do tonight, I guess. Finding all the mixtapes I made for girlfriends who’d just left me, and reliving the sadness to the accompaniment of Phil Collins.DAVID BECKHAM wishes to build a pond in his back garden, which is good news for insects, birds and wildle in general, but apparently it’s not such good news for his neighbours, who say there are already too many ponds in the area so another is not neededToo many ponds  I think what they meant to say is: “We are bitter and so twisted with jealousy that we want to make Mr Beckham’s le as miserable as ours have turned out to be.”OVER the past few years, cigarette sales in Britain have plummeted by million a month.Experts are struggling to understand why there has been such a massive fall and why it happened so quickly.Some say the health warnings are being effective. Some say it’s the cost. Some say it’s the ban on smoking indoors.I, however, know exactly what’s ­responsible.Exactly three years ago this week, the world’s heaviest smoker quit.

So for what you would pay for a house in London, where they average £,, you could buy TEN houses in Shildon.On Zoopla, the cheapest property on the market in Shildon is a two-bedroom terraced house just off the main shopping street.It has two spacious reception rooms, a stone fireplace and feature archway, and is well-located for primary schools and shops.Plus the nearest pub less than two minutes away where a pint of local bitter costs just £.. Astonishingly the house costs the same as a beach hut in Leysdown, Kent, at £,, and a beach hut in Bournemouth, Dorset, is on the market for nearly THREE times that.Property prices are so low in the town that there is even an auction taking place on July  where a two-bedroom mid-terrace house has a crazy guide price of just £,.Shildon’s main shopping street is full of small independent businesses with friendly local owners.

She planned it.”The -year-old, who did not receive payment for speaking to The Sun, has also reacted to the content.On Sunday, it was reported that Meghan and Harry had “rejected” the idea of getting help to protect her father, as their royal romance grew.He says he was also berated by Harry for co-operating with the press while in hospital recovering from heart surgery.From his home in Rosarito, Mexico, he said: “The fact the royals advised them to get me help and they refused to do it is incredible news.”A heartbroken Meghan, according to the book, sent her dad one final text the night before her wedding.He was due to walk his daughter down the aisle at Windsor Castle until it emerged that he posed for the photographs, which were sold to papers around the world.Yet Meghan was still desperate for him to attend.And Finding Freedom tells of how she left dozens of frantic messages for her dad — telling him a car would take him to Los Angeles airport so he could fly to London for the ceremony.But despite her “barrage of voicemails and texts”, he refused to get in the waiting vehicle.And he did not respond to messages after she called him “at least  times”.Mr Markle then began making a series of bizarre statements to the press and he eventually said the stress of dealing with the media had caused him to have a heart attack.Finally, he told her he would not be coming and only her mother Doria would be there. The book says: “If it wasn’t for Harry, Doria and her friends, Meghan herself says she wouldn’t have mentally got through it.”Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday newspaper for revealing the contents of a letter she wrote to her dad, claiming it was a breach of privacy.Mr Markle said he wanted to share the letter after its contents were publicly misrepresented in order to “vily” him.High Court legal papers revealed Meghan felt “unprotected” by the Royal Family while pregnant with son Archie and was unable to defend herself against  claims. Other private information, which would indicate the Sussexes must have been involved in the biography, includes details of voicemails Meghan sent to her dad and frosty conversations between Harry and William.It claims the Duke of Cambridge told his little brother not to rush things with “this girl” — a comment that allegedly sparked fury from a “p***ed off” Harry.The Duke of Sussex is then said to have moaned to a friend: “It’s a sick part of the society we live in today, and no one is doing anything about it.Where’s the positivity  Why is everyone so miserable and angry ”Meghan is quoted as telling a pal: “I gave up my entire le for this family. I was willing to do whatever it takes.”In another extract, the book amazingly reveals how Harry was left anguished after reading comments online dubbing him a “disgrace to the Royal Family”.A spokesman for Harry and Meghan said: “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not interviewed and did not contribute to Finding Freedom.“This book is based on the authors’ own experiences as members of the royal press corps and their independent reporting.”Author Scobie, asked whether there had been off-the-record conversations with the royal couple, said: “You’ve read the book.

But a full-scalesoon is not likely. That is not down to animosity... they have not yet reached what they were seeking to do.”  The biography also explains how Harry felt that the “old guard” at Buckingham Palace disliked Meghan.

And nor do we.When quizzed over whether the couple had given off record interviews, he added: No, and I think that you can tell from the reporting, my time around the couple is enough for me to know my subjects.Yet the detailed excerpts also revealed Meghans heartache over her father before her wedding to Prince Harry - saying she had sent a barrage of voicemails and messages to the -year-old.The book stated: The night before the wedding, she sent her father one last text. He did not reply.“Sitting in a bath later that night, FaceTiming with a friend, the bride-to-be said she had left her dad a final message, adding: ‘I can’t sit up all night just pressing send’.It was then claimed in the book that Harry and Meghan got secretly engaged on a trip to Botswana two months before telling the world.The biography also claims that Meghan had told a friend that she gave up her entire le for the Royal Family. She is said to have added: I was willing to do whatever it takes.Insiders claim that the Queen will be most affected by the new book.Speaking to Vanity Fair, a source close to the royal family said: “Its going to open old wounds at a time when everyone wanted to move on.“I think the person who will be most upset about it all is the Queen.”Finding Freedom is set to be released on August , but is already among the bestselling books on Amazon.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There will be people who think the system isnt fair this year, but the reality is that Covid isnt fair.A DfE spokesman said:  The vast majority of students will receive a calculated grade this summer that enables them to move on to the next stage of their education or training.Ofqual has developed a robust process that will take into account a range of evidence, including grades submitted by schools and colleges, with the primary aim of ensuring grades are as fair as possible for all students.An Ofqual spokesperson said: “We know teachers worked extremely hard to deliver this year’s arrangements and final grades this summer will be calculated using both centre assessment grades and a rank order of students provided by the centre.“It is not true to say the centre assessment grades are not being used – they are an important component of this year’s arrangements and have assisted centres when developing their rank orders. They have been instrumental during testing to identy the fairest process, and are being used to quality assure the outputs. Centre assessment grades are the primary source of evidence to calculate grades for low entry subjects, small centres and those lacking historical data.“From the data that we have reviewed, we expect the majority of grades students receive will be the same as their centre assessment grades, reflecting the skills, professionalism and integrity of those involved.”Any student unable to receive a calculated grade, or who would like to improve their grade will have an opportunity to take exams again in the autumn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Teaching unions have called on ministers to look again at the rules so that pupils and staff have to wear masks after the summer holidays. They claim that guidance for children over  to cover their faces on public transport and in shops shows they should be worn in schools and colleges too. But the Government has ruled out making them mandatory in secondaries amid concerns they would make little dference when students and staff spend so much time together. Some schools have already taken matters into their own hands and are making face masks mandatory or “very strongly encouraged” when pupilsto school.  Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers’ union, said: “The Government’s guidance for schools is now out of step with wider public health guidance and guidance to other employers where it is recognised that where physical distancing cannot be assured, face masks should be worn. “So there is a strong argument that face masks should also be made compulsory for children when theyto secondary schools in September.” Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said she expected “most schools” to follow the guidance but there is “a fair degree of confusion about why face coverings are required in some settings but not in schools”. The GMB union has written to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson urging him to adjust the “double standards” in the Government’s guidance on face masks.National officer Karen Leonard said it was “plain common sense” that teachers and other workers in schools should be able to wear coverings. “Changing the rules for buses and shops to enforce the wearing of masks while actively discouraging those working in schools from wearing them is causing untold confusion,” she said.  “It’s time for Gavin Williamson and his colleagues to rethink their position, provide clarity and consistency for our valuable school staff, and ensure PPE - including face masks - is available and can be worn by staff in schools where required.” The Government has so far resisted calls to change its guidance on face coverings for school settings. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We have set out the controls schools should use, including cleaning and hygiene measures, to substantially reduce the risk of transmission of the virus when they open to all children from September.  “This does not include the wearing of face coverings as we believe the system of controls laid out adequately reduced the risk of transmission to both staff and students.” "},{"url":null,"title":"labours nick thomas symonds wants","story":"NewsLabours Nick Thomas-Symonds wants violent criminals to fear police againEXCLUSIVE: Labours new Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds has unveiled his tough approach in an interview with the Daily Mirror and vowed to repair the damage wrought by the Torys police cuts in the  Red Wall seats the party wonShareCommentsByJason BeattieHead of politics:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video nick-thomas-symonds-blasts-dominic-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

These include Darlington, where violent crimes increased by , between  and , Don Valley, with a rise of , over the same period and Wakefield, up ,. In all these seats police numbers also fell in the past decade. Mr Thomas-Symonds added: “These figures show the massive damage the Tories have done to police numbers and the rocketing of violent crime that inevitably followed. “You are more likelyyou have less money to be the victim of a crime. “It’s those people I want to speak for and act for as Home Secretary. “Those people who see the crime on their street, that is what drives me to do all I can as Home Secretary so they feel safe in their communities.”  A former university lecturer and barrister, Mr Thomas-Symonds, , was named as Shadow Home Secretary by Keir Starmer despite only being elected to Parliament in .He was brought up in the Torfaen constituency in South Wales, which he now represents. And he is aware of the “mountain Labour has to climb” to win power. At last year’s election he saw his majority cut in the former stronghold to just , – a far cry from the , majorities enjoyed by his predecessor Paul Murphy. “We are a political party that has lost four general elections in  years. “The problems are not going to be simply solved,” he said. “The reality is we are  days in after losing four general elections. “Keir has made a fantastic start but none of us underestimate how far there is to go.”  So how does Labour scale that mountain  For Mr Thomas-Symonds it comes down to “fundamentally building trust”. He said: “The brutal reality of Labour Party history is we have spent far too long out of office. “You can talk about any of the last four general elections we have not won a majority or come close to the  seats we need. Why  Because people have fundamentally lost trust.“That said, I spoke to people on the doorstep in the  general election and they would say to me ‘I’m Labour, I consider myself Labour but I cannot vote for you’. And we have not been linking to those voters and we have not convinced them to trust us.”He added: “We have not convinced them of our ability to deliver the programme we need to.” In addition to his political career Mr Thomas-Symonds has found time to write the biographies of Labour greats Clement Attlee and Nye Bevan. Unsurprisingly, it is fellow Welshman Bevan who is his political hero. He has already drawn favourable comparisons with the NHS founder for his fluency in the Commons chamber – and there is more than a passing physical resemblance between the two.  But it is his maternal grandmother Olwyn Thomas whom he credits for nurturing his interest in politics. The steelworker’s son recalls: “I can just about remember the fall of Margaret Thatcher in  but it was the shadow she cast over the area in terms of the taking away of jobs that were dangerous but high-quality local jobs. And what struck me very forcefully at the time was that we need to use the talents of people around me far more effectively. “I was seeing people who wanted opportunity but those opportunities were not there. “My grandmother would sayyou want to make a dference, you have to go into politics.” On immigrationLabour will decide its immigration policy after it has assessed the impact of Brexit and Covid-.Mr Thomas-Symonds said: “What we have to do is see the consequences of the profound changes that are currently happening and that’s why I’m reticent to say X, Y or Z. “The Tories will try to drive wedges everywhere. Labour is a party that wants to unite and I think fairness in our immigration system is something that can unite people.” On kne crime    Tougher sentences for kne crime are on the table, Mr Thomas-Symonds said, but he stresses that prevention must also play a part. He added: “I have supported tougher sentences on ious crimes and I am always willing to look at that for the deterrent effect. “But we can’t lose sight of prevention. That’s about a properly resourced violent crime strategy and those prevention services that have been undermined in the past  years.” On the police Mr Thomas-Symonds expressed concern at recent images of heavy-handed policing, but refused to say forces were institutionally racist. He said: “We mustn’t lose sight of the work the vast majority of our police officers do and support them in it.” Stop and search should be intelligence-led and Section  powers, which allow police to search anyone within a certain area, should be used sparingly, said Mr Thomas-Symonds. Profile Not for nothing is Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds known as Labour’s History Man. Alongside a blooming political career he has found time to write biographies of Clement Attlee and his hero and fellow Welshman Nye Bevan. A third biography on Harold Wilson is coming soon. Thomas-Symonds, , lives with his we Rebecca and their three children Matilda, , Florence, eight, and William, four, in Abersychan. Abersychan, a village in the Torfaen constituency which he has represented since , breeds MPs like McVitie’s turns out biscuits. Former Welsh Secretary Paul Murphy hails from there, as does Don Touhig, Arthur Jenkins and former Home Secretary Roy Jenkins.

For just £ Laura Print, , and boyfriend Kevin Ingram,  renovated the van ready for romantic trips away. Now, having accomplished their ten-week project, the pair spend their weekends cooking, walking and exploring before camping out on stunning English beaches and beside lakes.Complete with a pull out sofa bed surrounded by fairy lights and a kitchen aposareaapos opening out onto breathtaking views - and even a portable shower - the duo have materialised a dream they both had long before coupling up nine months ago, Birmingham Live reported.Speaking while soaking up the sun with her partner on a beach in Newquay, sports masseuse Laura said: Iaposve dreamt of doing it for quite a while because I travelled round Australia and lived in a van so thataposs given me the drive to get one over here. I literally work to travel, thataposs why I work - it is amazing, I love it. Kevaposs mentioned [buying a camper] in the past and never actually done it. I think with me suggesting it, he just said: aposLets just get one togetherapos.The couple had been looking to start their project for months, but only found their  VW van a week before the coronavirus lockdown via Facebook marketplace.We made it a project then for the whole of lockdown. Itaposs because of furlough weaposve been able to do this, weaposve tried to cram as many trips in as possible before Kevin goes back to work at the end of July. And with my massage, because Iaposm self-employed I can work my travel around clients.The van, which they picked up from Derby, was originally £, but they managed to haggle the seller down to just £,. The costs of the renovation - including electrics, the cooker and the shower - came to just under £, with the couple keeping costs down by upcycling. Instead of buying the wood, the flooring, cladding and ceiling were created from wood a friend was throwing out during a renovation of her salon. When we bought the van, it had a rock and roll bed and kitchen but it was quite old and rusty, so when we got it home we decided to start from scratch.  We didnapost really have a clue what we were doing with it, but we just kind of put it together and built it from there, she explained. Me and Kev were never handy, we have never used a drill or anything before. My brother started us off, he ripped everything out to make it blank canvas then he laid the floor. From that Kev just learned in that first few days how to drill and everything . After ten weeks, the couple were ready for their first road trip to the Lake District. For showers, they plug a £ shower head - bought off Amazon - into the electrics and find a secluded spot to wash themselves outside the van. You do go a while without showering. It is hard, but itaposs easier for Kev than for me. We try and find a secluded space to have a shower. Dry shampoo is just a dream, that keeps me going, she added.

The latest ‘wellness’ ingredient, CBD, an abbreviation of cannabidiol, can now be found in everything from skin cream and coffee to protein powders and even intimate lubricants. During the coronavirus pandemic, interest in the supplement has grown, with more than , people searching for CBD oil on Google each month, hoping to find help for everything from insomnia and stress to skin breakouts. It seems many of us remain wary, unsure what it does, how to use it or whether it is addictive. Here, Dr Dani Gordon, medical doctor and internationally renowned CBD expert, answers commonly asked questions. What are the dferences between CBD, cannabis and medical cannabis  CBD is one of about  natural compounds that make up the cannabis plant. Hemp plants have a large amount of CBD but a low proportion of THC , the chemical compound which exists in higher levels in non-hemp strains of the plant and is responsible in larger amounts for the high people get from ‘street’ cannabis. Medical cannabis became legal in the UK in late , requiring a specialist doctor’s prescription for severe pain conditions, some forms of seizures and many other severe chronic medical conditions where other drugs failed. It contains THC in ying degrees and is usually taken orally, in very controlled amounts, under the ­supervision of a medical doctor. Is CBD legal  CBD oil is legal in the UK and can be sold on the high street provided it contains virtually no THC, as this is a controlled substance under the Misuse of Drugs Act . It must be properly labelled and from a hemp source, which means it has been tested and found to contain less than .% THC. Many CBD products are now puried to be completely THC-free. What do people use CBD oil for  The oil is used for general wellbeing support, similar to omega- fish oil or vitamin supplements, and also for more specic issues, ranging from inflammation and pain to anxiety, stress and period pain. Clinical trials have demonstrated signicant benefits for a wide range of health problems, from epilepsy to MS to Parkinson’s disease.  Can you take too much, and will I feel high  CBD oils and wellness products that you can buy over the counter cannot make you feel high because they are either THC-free or contain less than .% THC. So you are safe to try them without worrying about feeling intoxicated. Everyone’s body has dferent needs and so will respond slightly dferently to CBD, so there is no fixed amount that is right for everyone. The best way is to start small, taking mg of oil at a time sublinguallyand then increase as ­necessary. Never exceed the stated maximum, and reduce your doseyou feel drowsy. Take it with caution alongside alcohol, antihistamines or other drugs that can cause ­symptoms of drowsiness. Could I become addicted  Because CBD is a non-psychoactive compound, it does not appear to cause addiction. The World Health Organisation has declared it non-addictive. Do CBD skin creams really have benefits  CBD has been shown in pre-clinical research to have anti-acne effects on skin cells and it is also anti-inflammatory. That means it may be useful for acne-prone skin and sensitive or dry skin with eczema, while some people even report that it has helped more severe skin issues, such as psoriasis. Will CBD help me sleep  CBD may help reduce stress by acting on the brain areas involved in stress and anxiety, sothese issues are keeping you awake, the answer is probably yes. However, CBD doesn’t knock you out like sleeping pills can. Can CBD help with joint aches and arthritis  What is the best form  As CBD is a potent anti-inflammatory, many people find it helpful for joint and muscle pains, used topically to the areas in need. Taking a CBD daily supplement over timeyou have more generalised pain can help in some people. But the dose and response ies, so seek advice from an expert. Could I take CBD instead of HRT to treat symptoms of menopause  Many women find CBD can help with the feelings of stress, sleep and anxiety that can happen in the perimenopausal age range, although no large research studies have been done so far ­specically on menopausal symptoms for CBD wellness products. However, it is a low-risk thing to try before decidingyou need HRT, ­especially alongside other natural approaches.

At Skin Proud we want to help everyone embrace their inner beauty and realise that what is seen on social media is often far from reality.  The study also found  per cent lack confidence because they feel there is a lot of pressure to look a certain way. And  per cent donapost feel secure in their own skin because their natural look is dferent to the image they portray of themselves on social media. Blemishes emerged as a common cause of the confidence crisis for a quarter of those polled, while nearly a fth will feel less confident because of acne.As a result,  per cent of female respondents said they put makeup on to feel attractive - suggesting they would not without it. The research also found women are more likely than men to filter their images for social media -  per cent of women compared to  per cent of men. The main reason for going filter-heavy was to edit out blemishes, although  per cent try and enhance features like their lips. More than a third will try and smooth out their skin, while a tenth will attempt to reduce the size of their nose.

Just like when Diana snubbed the Duchess of York, after Fergie claimed Di’s hand-me-down shoes had given her terrible verrucas.  But the problem with the Kate and Meghan fall-out is that they never really bonded in the first place. That burgeoning friendship in  was all a bit of a sham – and Harry and William were already heading down such dferent paths that their wives were destined to remain distant. Yet,we are to believe the pro-Sussex propaganda in new book Finding Freedom, it could all have been so very dferent. If only Kate had “reached out” to Meghan so they could “bond” over their shared royal lestyles. If only she and William had schlepped all the way up to Oxfordshire with the three kids to visit the newlyweds in their rented cottage, as “the invite was there”. If only Kate had asked Meghan to go shopping with her that day they were both heading out to Kensington’s swanky stores at the same time.  If only Kate had “checked in on her during her most dficult times” rather than just sending her flowers, inviting her to the Royal box at Wimbledon two years running, hosting her bridal party, having her round at Christmas, cooking her vegan meals and generally rolling out the red carpet to guide her into the royal Firm. If only Kate had done all the things Meghan felt she ought to have done to show they were on an equal footing – even though they’re not, as Kate is a future Queen."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle prince harry told","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Prince Harry told to ‘stop whining during pandemic by dad ThomasMeghan Markle and Prince Harry deny having had anything to do with new bombshell biography Finding Freedom, which could further damage their relationship with the Royal FamilyShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror am video paul-burrell-says-harry-meghan-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news meghan-markle-prince-harry-told-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

There are fears the book could be the final nail in the coffin for the Sussexesapos relationship with other members of The Firm - with Thomas Markle now taking a swipe at the royal couple. He said: This is the worst time in the world to be whining. And in a further blow, he told The Sun: I love my daughter but I really don’t appreciate what she’s become right now. The book - by former royal correspondents Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand - alleges Meghan felt let down when her dad lied to her by denying he helped stage paparazzi photos prior to her wedding in May . A week before the big day, Kensington Palace officials heard the photo shoot was to be exposed in the press as having been staged. The book says palace communications staff and lawyers were moving to have publication stopped, as Meghan phoned her father.  Dad, we need to knowthis is true or not, because my team is going to try and stop this story from running -you are telling me itaposs fake, she reportedly told him. If they do that, theyaposre going out of their way to protect you, Dad. Youaposre telling me youaposre being victimised, right  Mr Markle had replied Of course, failing to admit he had participated in the staging of the photos, which were duly exposed as set-ups in the press the next day.  Despite his deception, Meghan had still wanted her father at her wedding. He ultimately did not attend, partly due to suffering a heart attack days before the event, which he blamed on the stresses of pressure from the media. The book gives further glimpses of Meghanaposs troubled relationship with Mr Markle, including a string of uned phone messages and texts from the former actress to her father in the days before her wedding. A spokesman for Harry and Meghan said the couple did not contribute to Finding Freedom, but he did not deny the content of published extracts.

Palace insiders claim the couple’s time as royals is “done and dusted” amid claims they collaborated on the book, Finding Freedom. And they say the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been “incredibly naive” for suggesting they did not cooperate with authors Omid Scobie, a British journalist close to Meghan’s inner circle, and Carolyn Durand, an American television journalist. One palace source said: “The bridges are well and truly burned. Harry and Meghan’s time as part of the team is done and dusted. “In fact I’d be amazedyou could find anyone here who would want to work for the Sussexesthey wanted toto the fold. “Their whole attitude was always incredibly self serving and now it’s been laid bare for all to see.” In January, Harry and Meghan agreed their roles as royals would be reviewed after  months. But the source said: “Even when the time comes for the review, as promised, there will be no welcome back party, not that it appears they would want it. “Even though it’s six months since they detonated their own nuclear bomb by announcing they were walking away, the world is a very dferent place now.  “While the rest of the family have been busy putting their time into good causes and adapting their roles amid the coronavirus outbreak, Harry and Meghan have fast become a complete sideshow.“The feeling is to let them get on with it because everyone will eventually see it for the noise it is.” Insiders told of “shock” in the palace at the couple’s “lack of remorse” for the breakdown in relationships with William and Kate, Prince Charles, the Queen and Prince Philip. One source said: “The genuine feeling was there would be far more modesty on show, perhaps a touch of contrition with the way things have turned out, but there’s a complete lack of remorse for the way relationships were turned upside down. There’s barely a hint of self awareness. “The overwhelming feeling is Harry and Meghan have been incredibly naive to think anyone will believe they had no input in the publication. “When they were in the camp they didn’t take a crumb of advice, it was always their way or the inevitable explosion of emotion, there was no compromise, no discussion. “They chose to walk away from all the protections they were afforded because of some misguided view everyone was out to challenge them, which couldn’t have been further from the truth.” Extracts of the book in The Times today told how Meghan’s attitudes to the press had changed. The book tells how the couple were in Toronto in October  when one of Harry’s aides rang to say that a newspaper was about to reveal they were in a relationship. It states: “While Meghan, before she met Harry, had occasionally set up a paparazzi photo or let info slip out to the press, she did everything in her power to protect the privacy of her relationship with the press.” "},{"url":null,"title":"nandos making big change chickens","story":"NewsNandos is making big change to its chickens - and it involves insectsThe chicken restaurant aims to cut its carbon emissions to net zero and halve the carbon footprint of its average meal over the next ten years, and will feed chicken on insects instead of chicken feedShareCommentsByNada FarhoudEnvironment editor:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsThe trial comes as Nandos aims to cut its carbon emissions to net zero and halve the carbon footprint of its average meal over the next ten years\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Itaposs been a miserable start to the week and that trend is set to continue on Tuesday with downpours and heavy wind gusts - mph in parts of Scotland - by the afternoon. But incoming high pressure will allow temperatures to steadily climb with Friday soaring into the s for the first time this month, albeit on the final day of July. BBC forecaster Nick Miller said: After such a wet and windy start youaposd be forgiven for thinking autumn had come early, so hereaposs a sight for sore eyes: Friday, summer fighting back, temperatures widely in the mid to upper s, some the low syou like that sort of thing. But one day doesnapost make a heatwave and, well, itaposll be out as soon as it arrives, that heat, he continued. But it will arrive with a pressure pattern at the end of the week allowing the wind to turn from a northwesterly now to a south-southeasterly. Thataposs the direction that will draw up the heat and for a time it will come with plenty of sunshine. BBC weather charts show C in London on Friday afternoon, in line with the hottest days of the year so far.However, Mr Miller warned thataposs still a few days off with Tuesday looking like a particularly cool day for this time of year, with plenty of blustery wind and some showers. Though there will be more sunshine than Monday. Some overnight showers are continuing into this morning, with temperatures dipping to single figures in parts of the north of England.  But itaposs the far northeast of Scotland and the Northern Isles that will feel the brunt of the rain and where the wind will be strongest. Showers will be felt across the west, including some in Northern Ireland as well as northwest England and north Wales. However, where in England and Wales the weather will remain fairly dry, with any outbreaks moving quickly as the wind continues to pick up. Temperatures could reach highs of C, but most of the country will be languishing in the teens, while Wednesday will be largely dry, before things start to really pick up on Thursday. Then on Friday the sunshine and the heat - but spoiler, itaposs cooler again for all at the weekend, added Mr Miller.

The resulting confusion means that many Brits could end up holidaying in the UK for aposstaycationsapos this summer - rather than escaping to sunnier climes.  Monday was a washout for many parts of the UK today, but warm and sunny weather is expected this weekend before low pressure once again s. Long-term forecasts are notoriously hard to predict but the Met Office has given a tentative outlook for those holidaying at home.Meteorologists at the Met Office say August could be changeable with the start of the month likely to be the wettest and windest. Their weather forecast says: Through early August changeable weather is likely to continue with bands of rain, perhaps accompanied by strong winds, interspersed with brighter, showery conditions.However, all areas should have some dry spells, these most likely in the east, with a better chance of dry spells more generally late in the period. It is likely to be on the cool side for western areas, but with temperatures closer to average across the east and southeast. The second week of August is likely to see a mixture of dry and settled conditions, interspersed with occasional bouts of wetter and windier weather. The majority of the unsettled weather will most likely be in the north and west, though it may spread further south and east from time to time.  Temperatures are likely to be around the average for this time of year, with any particularly warm weather being short-lived and generally towards the south or southeast. Looking further ahead into late-August, there are some tentative signs that conditions could become more widely dry and settled, particularly in the southeast. Paul Knightley a senior forecaster with DTN said he expects rainfall and wind to be above normal with a few very wet and windy days likely. He said: Overall weaposre looking at a pretty unsettled monthand it being on the changeable side. There will be no real hot long dry spells but that doesnapost preclude short dry spells in the second half of next month.  We could be seeing the low thirties on Friday, but more unsettled patterns next week. Weaposve had a pretty active tropical season this year which we find tends to result in more unsettled weather patterns. Maybe in September we could get calmer drier summer - people shouldnapost lose hope of getting some finer weather later in the year. This yearaposs weather this July been markedly cooler than this time last year when the weather soared to .C in Cambridge. Temperatures are set to rise to C on Friday, making the UK hotter than Spain and finishing off a week that has started damp and breezy. According to the Met Office the end of week will see the country basking in a aposvery warm spellapos with lots of sunshine and summer heat in the south east of England."},{"url":null,"title":"teen who married 71 year","story":"NewsTeen who married -year-old after meeting at funeral says shes fighting for leWorried Gary Hardwick, now , has called on his TikTok followers to pray for we Almeda, , who is fighting for her le in hospital after suffering a heart attackShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news weird-news video gary-hardwick-updates-tiktok-followers-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news us-news teen-who-married--year-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease official, said a readout from the trial could come by November or even earlier. Fauci said he was not particularly concerned about the vaccineaposs safety after seeing data from earlier, smaller trials. Trial volunteers will receive two injections about  days apart of either  micrograms of mRNA- or a placebo. Results of a small early-stage study published earlier this month showed volunteers who got two doses of Modernaaposs vaccine had levels of virus-killing antibodies that exceeded the average seen in people who had recovered from Covid-.

The horror accident occurred on Friday night as the skater rode along the pavement with the takeaway food in one hand and a beer bottle in his pocket. His femoral artery was severed when he hit the concrete and traumatised witnesses tried to stem the bleeding, but to no avail.

Witnesses were said to have been confronted with a distressing scene, and said they could barely see the pavement through his blood.

Local rangers from the City of Melville local government area have erected a sign to warn people about the hazardous footpath. While it remains unclear what caused the skateboarder to come off his board, local residents told reporters the pavement on McKimmie Road, in Palmyra, in Perth’s south west, was uneven and likely contributed.

The pistols, known as “Paektusan”, were conferred by the leader to dozens of senior officers, who pledged their loyalty to him, state media reported. They were pictured surrounding the leader with the weapons held in front of their chests. The ceasefire, signed after three years of war, left the peninsula ided and many families split by the so-called Demilitarized Zonebetween North and South Korea.

North Korean trade has been targeted due to Kim Jong Unaposs drive for nuclear weapons. In a bid to help its citizens stave their hunger, the governmentaposs website Naenara has advised people to eat terrapins.  From olden times, terrapin has been used in making haute cuisine for its good taste and abundant nutrient component, the website says,  The Sun reported. It has ious essential nutrient components including protein, essential amino acid and vitamin efficacious for curing hepatitis, hypertension and other diseases. Its blood, carapace and bone are widely used as materials of Koryo medicines. In particular, its blood is efficacious for diabetes and weak children. It is recommended that terrapins are served raw or made into broths, stews or porridges. The North Korean economy is having one of its worst years in recent history. In  UN sanctions came into force, blocking almost all of its trading routes aside from those with China.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society. Now that it is realised how our inidual decision making makes a dference, whatever our age, we have no need to feel helpless.It is time to ask for the information and support we need."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSimon Macdonald from Kilmichael Glassary submitted this week#s featured image.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies,# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure that the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"absolutely-vital-shop-local-save-high-streets","story":"The Scotland Loves Local campaign has launched across the country to encourage Scots to go back to their roots, think local first and support their local high streets safely and in line with public healthguidelines.The Coronaviruspandemic has hit high streets and local businesses hard - now is the time to support them to get back on their feet.

east end of High Street, it would be ldquoconverting part of Elcho Green to a temporary car park to support access to the High Street area.It stated that ldquofollowing a meeting with local traders, North Berwick CommunityCouncil and North Berwick Coastal Area Partnership, agreement has been reached to introduce a number of temporary measures in the town ndash but both the community council and area partnership told the Courier they had not given backing to the Elcho Green changes.The councilrsquos own timetable had Elcho Green car park opening last Friday .An online petition, West Bay not Parking Bay, to ldquoprotect stunning and iconic West Bay in North Berwick, was launched by resident Sarah Russell and had attracted more than , signatures in less than a week.It said: ldquoEast Lothian Council have announced plans to turn Elcho Green into a longstay car park.ldquoWhilst the council state that this is a temporary measure to comply with their Covid Spaces for People initiative, it is greatly feared that this will, in fact, lead to a permanent car park in the most iconic seafront location in East Lothian.\"North Berwick residents and visitors alike will be robbed of the very essence of this beautul recreational space that personies this famous conservation area seafront.ldquoTemporary or otherwise, Elcho Green is not the correct location for any car parking and we would urge you to help us stop this environmental catastrophe.Among those supporting the campaign was world-famous golfer and North Berwick resident Catriona Matthew, captain of Europersquos winning Solheim Cup team.The Courier has been swamped with letters and emails against the plans .The scheme was described as ldquoindefensible and ldquoundemocratic vandalism by some residents, while many asked why there had not been specic consultation on the plan and highlighted that the land had been gted to the town by the late Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple for recreational use in .On Monday, East Lothian Council released a statement that it was placing the ldquoElcho Green temporary car parking proposal on hold to allow us a further opportunity to engage and consult.It is the second time in a month that the councilrsquos plans to transform town centres have hit the buffers.Earlier in July, proposals to suspend parking in town centres were put ldquoon hold after traders and residents in Haddington reacted with anger as cones and parking suspension signs were put up overnight, sparking widespread concern.In Mondayrsquos statement, Councillor Norman Hampshire , environment spokesperson, said: ldquoEast Lothian Council has successfully implemented a number of physical distancing measures on North Berwick High Street to support the need for safe access to the town centre and economic recovery.ldquoA further support for Spaces for People was a proposal to utilise a small part of Elcho Green in North Berwick as a temporary car park.ldquoThe benefit of this would have been a reduction in the number of vehicles circling and queuing for parking spaces, enhanced safety for pedestrians and cyclists within the town centre, and improved air quality.ldquoEast Lothian Council is a listening authority and we are aware of the ious perspectives being raised within the North Berwick community.ldquoAs such, we intend to place the Elcho Green temporary car parking proposal on hold to allow us a further opportunity to engage and consult.\"This delay will also enable us to monitor the impact of increased traffic as a result of visitors and to assess the effectiveness of measures introduced.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said that recent u-turns were down to a ldquolack of political leadership within the Labour administration.He said he received more than  emails objecting to the Elcho Green plans.He called for a report on the Spaces for People plans, and in particular parking proposals in North Berwick, to be put before a meeting of elected council group leaders in two weeksrsquo time for approval.Under emergency Covid- procedures, normal council business is currently suspended and decisions are taken at monthly meetings of the group leaders and council chief executive.He said: ldquoThe decision must be approved by councillors at the leadersrsquo group meeting and it should be open and transparent and open to the press.Mr Hampshire accused Mr Currie of ldquoplaying politics in ldquoan emergency situation.ldquoWe have allowed him to take part in the meetings with officers at every point during the discussions, said Mr Hampshire.ldquoI have got to say the Conservative Group have been fully behind what we are doing.\"For the SNP to try to play politics in a situation where their own Government is instructing local authorities to create spaces in town centres is unbelievable.Conservative councillor Craig Hoy called on the administration to ldquotake notice of the recent problems caused by parking proposals.He said the Scottish Government had failed to give councils enough time to push through emergency Covid measures in town centres.Councillor Hoy said: \"Scottish Councils are operating under huge pressure with limited resources, but that does not remove the need for them to consult fully and communicate clearly on big issues which impact our communities.\"I hope East Lothian Council and the Labour administration will take notice of the recent problems in North Berwick and fully engage with stakeholders.\"Hilary Smith, chair of North Berwick Coastal Area Partnership, stressed that the area partnership had not attended any meeting regarding Covid- plans for the town or given its approval to the plans.North Berwick Community Council said it had not discussed Elcho Green prior to its meeting on Tuesday.East Lothian Council received pound.million from Scottish Government funding for Spaces for People projects to make social distancing easier in town centres and encourage people toto them safely.The council launched a consultation in May, asking people for their county-wide views.It attracted , contributions and more than  comments, including more than  from the North Berwick area.But North Berwick residents have not been asked their specic views on Elcho Green car parking.The council said it had given consideration to parking availability at a number of sites in North Berwick.In response to questions from the Courier, the council said: ldquoThe high school and sports centre are both due to re-open in coming weeks so were unsuitable to use.ldquoAn area of Elcho Green is considered suitable to take traffic arriving from the west to park for people visiting the town to intercept the flow of traffic and stop vehicles circulating through the town unnecessarily searching for parking spaces and generating additional traffic pollution.ldquoIt also seemed reasonable considering the area of land is used annually for Fringe by the Sea events.\"A maximum of  places had been identied for use as a potential temporary car park which is not part of the Spaces for People grant but provided as part of the

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!DURING lockdown, I was trying to make the most of my free time ndash going on daily walks, working on my website, editing photos from before lockdown, designing my first book and completing A LOT of jigsaws .After the lockdown restrictions started to ease, I was able to spend even more time outdoors than I would normally do. I dedicated June to visiting dferent local sites to watch the kingfisher ndash which you may remember from my previous article ndash a family of wrens and the brown hares.One evening, as I was uploading my photographs on to social media and searching through the pages, I came across a few images of a bird that every birder wanted to see since its influx to the UK was published. It was a rosy starling!The beautul rosy starlinglooks nothing like the starlings we know. It strongly resembles a magpiewith a much shorter tail.This species is unmistakable in its adult plumage. The male has a pale pink body with a black head, wings, and tail. Additionally, during the breeding season the male develops a wispy crest and the black colour becomes glossier with a purplish green or blue sheen.The female is less vibrant than the male. Both sexes appear much duller outside of their breeding season.Furthermore, the rosy starling does not mimic other species, unlike its well-known cousin.What the two species have in common is murmuration ndash an astonishing and mesmerising aerial spectacle large flocks of these birds gather and perform a real show as they swoop, e and swirl across the sky in beautul shape-shting clouds. It is a phenomenon that pleases the eye of every observer.The rosy starlingrsquos breeding area stretches from the Balkans and Turkey to Central Asia and north-west China. It spends winters in India and south-east Arabia. As a strongly migratory species, it can travel outside of its normal breeding range. As a result, there are signicant periodic summer and autumn influxes in western Europe. The causes of such irruptions are not yet fully understood however, it appears to be related to changes in the population of locusts on which the birds feed.Imagine my amazement when I read that one of those birds had landed and made its temporary home in someonersquos garden in Port Seton!The cherry on the cake was that the night when I saw the first images of the rosy starling in East Lothian, I also received an email from Stuart Payne ndash the lucky host of the rosy starling. Stuart invited me to his garden.The next morning, my fianceacute Chris and I rushed to Port Seton. As we were walking towards Stuartrsquos house, we saw another birder looking around hoping to spot the rosy starling. As soon as we arrived at Stuartrsquos house, I saw this magnicent pink bird flying past the house and landing on the bird feeder to start its feast.Stuart and his we Gillian welcomed us in their garden, where I spent half an hour photographing the gorgeous rosy starling and chatting to Stuart and Gillian. I also took some time to admire their beautul dogs Hugo and Hobbes. These dogs were just wonderful, not every day you see dogs as well behaved as these two!My first and, I hope, not last experience with the rosy starling was unforgettable!

included introducing parking suspensions across town centres as it looked to create more space outside shops and relocate parking away from high streets.In Haddington town centre there was a furious response after cones and parking suspension notices went up over the first weekend of the changes, leaving traders and their customers fuming.Shop owners who had only just opened their doors feared the restrictions would stop costumers fromcoming to the market town and within days the council announced it was putting parking suspensions in all town centres on hold.Then last week, it announced plans to transform tourist hotspot North Berwickrsquos town centre and create a temporary -space car park on its iconic Elcho Green ndash a much-loved publicspace and putting green.The response from

councilrsquos Local Review Body overturned the refusal on appeal after councillors ruled the proposal was better than leaving the building to fall into disrepair.And they questioned whether the design of the new property, which featured extensive glass frontage to let in light, would, in fact, make the amenity more acceptable.Planning officers had estimated the new one-bedroom property would offer just nine square metres of living space in the proposed kitchen living area.The review body was told that there was no set standard for amenity and outlook when it came to conversions like the one put forward for the building, on the townrsquos Lamer Street.Instead, Leigh Taylor, council planning advisor, said it was down to the inidual officer involved.He said: ldquoThere is no exact standard, it

It has to find a new purpose.Councillor Norman Hampshire, review body chairman and ward member, also upheld the appeal.He said: ldquoIt has to have another use either as commercial or residential and I think residential is a good fit for this building.

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

He left behind parents Steve and Gee, sisters Donna, Stephanie, Angella and Dominique, and brother Daniel.Now,  years later, the BBC has made a one-off, -minute drama which imagines the le Walker could have lived.Written by Bafta winner Jimmy McGovern TV series such as Cracker and Broken, and the TV movie Hillsborough, Anthony is inspired by conversations with the teenagers devoted mother Gee.It is not only an incredibly moving and emotional story about loss but is also full of hope and love.The programme came about after Gee approached Liverpudlian McGovernand \"you just dont say no to Gee\", the writer lovingly quips.\"The BBC had just shown a really good film about the death of Damilola Taylor, and I knew thatI went to the BBC with a drama that showed a lead-up to the killing, the killing and the aftermath of the killing, about a young black boy, the BBC would say, Well, weve already done this with the Damilola Taylor story,\" continues McGovern, when we chat over Zoom .\"So, I had to find a fresh way in.

But when he introduced himself, \"she just basically gave all of us her blessing to tell the story and she wished us the best and it was nothing but positivity and kind words\".He chuckles as he adds what she whispered to him later on that day.\"I was improvising, I was throwing stuff in that wasnt even in the script at some points, and she just pulled me aside and went, Anthony didnt swear!\"A particularly poignant part of the film depicts Anthony getting married, to a woman named Katherine, who is played by World On Fire star Julia Brown.Gee was on set for the wedding scenes, and Jimoh recalls the moment she walked in to see him suited and booted for the ceremony.\"She grabbed me, and she went, Wow. This is what my son would look likehe was getting married.\"It was huge for both of us and we had the longest hug in the world.\"Katherine is not based on a real-le person, which Brown - known for BBC series World On Fire - describes as \"liberating\".However, there were obviously many challenging moments on set.\"Especially, with the way that Jimmy did it, the couple of the scenes at the end, we show the alternate reality,\" she elaborates.\"So, sometimes, Toheeb and I would be laughing... like, we were filming when he walks me home after our first date, and we were having a great time, and then Terry our director said to us, OK, now Toheeb, go stand over there and Julia were going to film you walking alone.\"\"And then it hits you like a wave... That was quite dficult.\"The show is coming out at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement. Following the shocking death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May - which was caught on camera - protests against racism and police brutality have taken place across the UK.\"It feeds into the conversations that people are having at the moment about the bizarre nature of racism and Anthony really highlights for me how nobody wins,\" notes Welsh star Rakie Ayola, who portrays Gee, and is best known for her role in Holby City.\"Obviously Anthonys family dont win but the people who killed him dont gain anything. They dont gain so much as a pound coin from what they do.\"There was no reason at all to kill that young man. It wasnt to take his wallet, his phone, which is ridiculous enough. There is something so pointless about putting your energy into any kind of hatred in that way.\"So,youre of a mind to not quite understand why everyone is up in arms about this racism thing, well here you go.\"But it also means that we will take a lot of heat from people who are bored with the racism conversation right now.\"Does Jimoh think things have changed for him, as a young black man, in the  years since Anthonys death \"Of course things have changed and moved forward - but we still have a huge way to go,\" he says.\"Whats interesting now is that the climate has shted a little and everyone is reimagining their relationship with race.\"As a country, thats important and a huge step forward, but nowhere near enough has happened yet.\"Even though she describes her daughters as \"home-bodies\", Ayola confides she has been having more blunt conversations with them, about \"being careful, why other people need to be careful\", since the death of George Floyd.\"Thats been interesting as a parent, explaining whats gone on and trying not to terry them,\" she adds.\"Theres still a lot of work to do, as what happened to Anthony could still happen again tomorrow.\"Anthony airs on BBC One on Monday, .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"new-favourite-podcast-rule-three","story":"Rule Of ThreeStrange title.

Thus the certainty with which Ms Stephenson presents her ldquocase simply has no basis in reality beyond a convenient conjecture.Her musings about membership of the EU, likewise present another unwarranted certainty.

In any event, evenMs Stephenson is correct that the EU would refuse an independent Scotland membershipit lacked its own currency, she writes asone is in the EU or not, when the fact is that, routinely the EU enters into association agreements with applicant states prior to full membership. These, while not according voting rights, could give Scotland much of what we want from membership, such as single market access, participation in EU schemes and freedom of movement.Of course,one starts from the proposition that Scotland should continue to be part of the UK, then any forecast of an independent future will be extremely negative.

She might want to look at her own contributions before being critical in this way of others.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.JILL Stephenson is correct, the British nationalist parties vetoed a currency union between Scotland and rUK, though it could only have worked short term in any case.After the break-up of Czechoslovakia, the establishment of new currencies was achieved quickly and pain-free. So Scotland should establish a new currency as quickly as possible, and as Scotland runs a substantial trade surplus we have a good basis from which to start. I prefer the ldquoNorway Option for Scotland, butwe did join the EU, the euro would be fine an optimal currency in a huge trade block on our doorstep.Would an independent Scotland have a per capita share of the substantial UK assets   If not we would then have no debt to repay . Butwe had Clark Crossrsquos trial run , we would spend our revenue for best Scottish bang-for-our-buck, not paying for expenditure outside Scotland ldquoon our behalf. We would not expect to pay any part of, or incur debt on behalf of, HS or renewing Trident, or the rebuilding of Westminster Palace, or any of the myriad of expenditures south of our border, any more than we would pay for spending programmes in, say, France.Of course, under Mr Crossrsquos suggestion, Scotland would have no way to access the many opportunities that a normal self-governing country has, but it would part the veil of dependency and let us see the most excellent vistarsquos that lie beyond. We only have to vote Yes.GR Weir, Ochiltree.I VERY much doubtClark Crosss proposal that Scotland should be given a two year \"trial run\" at independence would result in the waning of the desire for self-government as he confidently predicts. So far,  countries have gained independence from the UK, none of them has asked to come back and many of them celebrate the day that British colonial powers departed. As for Scotlands sustainability, other nations of similar size in population to Scotland are managing their independence very well, such as Denmark, Ireland, Norway, New Zealand, and Finland and there are plenty of other countries with far smaller populations than Scotland, such as Iceland, who are also thriving with self-respect, self-determination and self-government.Ruth Marr, Stirling.NICOLA Sturgeon often quips that Boris Johnsons a recruiting sergeant for Scottish independence. As a UK governmental committeehighlights \"credible\" evidence of Russian \"influence campaigns\" in the run-up to the  Scottish independence referendum, maybe shes confusing the Prime Minister with President Putin Martin Redfern, Melrose.SELFISHNESS OF THE ME SOCIETYI AM sure I was not the only one horried by the mess people left on the streets of Leeds when they celebrated theof their team to the top tier of English football.And just as many must have been appalled at the amount of litter left behind on a beach where many had gone to take advantage of the relaxation of lockdown.What we saw on our TV screens was shameful in relation to those two incidents.Those two sets of people, who were out to enjoy themselves, appear to have had neither common sense nor a conscience about the amount of clean-up which needed doing after their totally insouciant conduct.What could have been easier than to gather up their debris to deposit it in the available litter bins or to bring it home with them to dispose of it in their own refuse disposal bins at home Selfishness and a lack of consideration for others seem to be the characteristics we must expect from those who have no respect for their surroundings which they display in spades with their careless conduct.The me society is all too evident in those two episodes as though some people feel entitled to do what they like and devil take the hindmost.Freedom does not mean that we do not need to follow the rules and observe the proprieties of decency.I hope that those who made the mess felt thoroughly ashamed of what they had done when they saw the evidence of their disrespect scattered on the streets and the beach.Or is that too much to ask of those kinds of people Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.ROCK OF SAGESPROFESSOR John Underhill raises important points about the perception of geology in Scotland . Knowledge of geology has never been more important, for understanding and mitigating future climate change and helping Scotland meet the  net-zero emissions target. So it is concerning that the number of applications for geoscience degrees at Scottish universities is in sharp decline.The loss of Higher Geology is undoubtedly a factor, but there are many opportunities within the Curriculum for Excellence and other Highers such as Environmental Science and Geography for pupils to learn how the planet works, and the many dferent ways in which geology and geological processes impact on modern le in Scotland. Organisations such as the Geobus at St Andrews University and Scotlandrsquos Geoparks are doing excellent work in taking geology into the classroom, and placing it in the context of sustainable development. The recent launch of a new charity, the Scottish Geology Trust, recognises the need to support these existing initiatives, and for wider promotion of the importance of geology to Scotland.Angus Miller, Secretary, Scottish Geology Trust, Edinburgh.VIDEO GAGAROBERT McNeils piece on video gaming was embarrassing : there have been holograms with more substance.First, video gaming being for \"loners\": right, so all those adverts with families playing Nintendo Switch games togetherjust passed him by, as did World of Warcraft, Elder Scrolls Online, Rocket League and the umpteen other cooperation games where you have no chance of advancement or success without teamwork.Next, \"all the games had themes of violence and fighting\".

The picture is by no means as clear cut as Mr McKay attempts to present it. While he is obviously familiar with the titles of some of Dickensrsquos novels, he ought to read Martin Chuzzlewit, in which Dickensrsquos horror of slavery is abundantly clear. He should also read the chapter on slavery in American Notes, which shows Dickensrsquos utter revulsion at the manner in which slave owners treated their slaves.As to the assertion that ldquoDickens didnrsquot have much time for Catholics I would suggest that he read Pictures from Italy, where he will learn that Dickens took issue with aspects of ritual, but not with Catholics as people. He might try Barnaby Rudge, which, as he may know, is an account of the ldquoNo Popery Gordon riots of .

The UK Government has pledged another poundm to help keep the arts in Scotland afloat.Sector insiders do not believe this money will be enough, as the scale of Glasgow Lersquos financial problems demonstrates.The charity receives about poundm a year from the council to deliver its core services. But it supplements this core funding with fees for everything from swimming pools and gyms and admissions to concerts and events. Its famous museums do not charge visitors but partly make up for this with money from gt shops, cafes and one-off special exhibitions.Glasgow Le is understood to have offset some of its fixed costs by furloughing hundreds of workers involved in this commercial operation. But it has to cover the full wage bills of its core workers.In their letter, Ms Aitken and Mr McDonald, who chairs Glasgow Le, stressed that Glasgow was far more economically dependent on its arts and sports sector than other parts of Scotland.Moreover, city spending on arts and sports delivers a dramatic multiplier effect.The city leaders wrote: ldquoSince , tourism to Glasgow has grown from . million to . million visitors.

Glasgow is behind Manchester and London for music tourism but its concerts still generate poundm from visitors to the city every year, they said.Earlier this month Glasgow Le published a schedule for re-opening its venues. Only a third were included in its first phase. Kelvingrove will open its doors in the middle of August the riverside transport museum at the end of the month losing all the income they would have received during the school holidays.This echoes a nationwide pattern. The Association of Scottish Visitor Attractions last month found that nearly half of the nationrsquos museums, galleries, castles and other historic sites may remain closed until .Normally  million people would go through the doors of Glasgow Le venues every year.Mr McDonald told The Herald: ldquoWe have always had a great working relationship with the Scottish Government but now wersquore asking them to step up more, to ensure that the huge contribution Glasgow Le can make to Glasgow and Scotlandrsquos economic and social recovery is fully realised and not held back by the unavoidable financial challenges that have resulted from this global pandemic and lockdown.The city council has been supporting Glasgow Le through the lockdown and is getting some extra money from central governments to cope with extra Covid costs.Insiders stress that local authorities across Scotland have lost substantial revenue while their commercial centres were closed.

There should be no inevitability about this, however, and indeed I would suggest that they may find their own form of prosperity should they follow these eight simple rules. - Understand where you are and why yoursquore thereIn considering the narrative of last weekrsquos visit by Boris Johnson, which was presumably pre-briefed by Downing Street, one would be forgiven for thinking that nobody in the Prime Ministerrsquos operation has seen any of the news which has emanated from Scotland over the last  years. To suddenly be plunged into apparent lsquopanic modersquo is to misunderstand unionismrsquos position. Unionismrsquos deficit has been coming for years. Indeed, far from being a resounding victory, it looks increasingly as though the  referendum simply came early enough on the x-axis for unionism to survive. But unionism is not in the doldrums because of any irresistible pull-factor inherent in Scottish nationalism rather, there is a signicant push-factor involved. Unionism is stuck in an unappealing, perpetual panic, reacting to everything, offering nothing positive. SNP wins an election unionists create the Calman Commission. Yes almost wins the referendum unionists create the Vow and the Smith Commission. It is a humiliating lack of thought, understanding and planning all rolled into one. - Be less emotionalI appreciate I am in the minority as someone who does not feel particularly nationalistic or patriotic, either towards Britain or Scotland, however unionistsrsquo emotional, sometimes rather hysterical, obsession with lsquoour precious unionrsquo is preventing sensible decision making. Too many unionists exude the air of people who are confused and embittered that the general population doesnrsquot share their unrequited love. A more clinical approach, which is much more characteristic of nationalist leaders, would create the space for far more sensible decision making.: Nicola Sturgeon facing questions over her knowledge of Alex Salmond probe - Stop visiting Scotland to lsquosave the unionrsquoThis is a foolish endeavour for a number of reasons, but most obviously it underlines the fact that members of the Cabinet seldom come to Scotland, a part of the UK which they have just as much right to visit as anywhere , including England. Cabinet visits would be far less controversial, more normal indeed,they happened more often. - Stop talking Scotland downUnionists think this is a nationalist trope, but they are wrong: the tone of unionist communications is counterproductive and corrosive. Coronavirus has turbocharged the temptation to revert to this approach, and the notion that an independent Scotland could not have afforded furlough and a range of other measures is now a centrepiece of unionist messaging. It is, of course, nonsense, and while an independent Scotland would inevitably face uncertainty in its initial years, there is no reason to expect that it would not rapidly develop the ideological maturity to create a wealthy country.:Michael Gove not distracted by independence support surge as devolution key to union case - Stop doing the nationalistsrsquo work for themA great deal of unionist action plays directly into the hands of nationalism. Because of the raw emotion , Unionists tend to define victory as denying the SNP something that it wants, without understanding that this plays perfectly into the nationalist narrative. The prime example of this, which is coming at unionists like a herd of buffalo, is the current policy of saying no to a second independence referendum, evenit is secured with a majority of seats, perhaps even votes, on a clear manesto commitment. Unionists may see this as a clever tactic which puts Nicola Sturgeon in a hole, but in the medium- to long-term it is an appalling strategy which pushes soft unionists, dismayed at the denial of democracy, to the other side. - Get Brexit doneBy default, we consider Brexit to push Scotland towards independence, but in fact a swt Brexit with a reasonable deal has a good chance of becoming a positive for unionism. I voted Remain, but despite this I expect the outcome of Brexit to be signicantly less damaging than doomsayers predict, and this, coated in the toxic prospect of a customs border between Scotland and England should an independent Scotland rejoin the EUrsquos Customs Union, may well flip the Brexit issue from the nationalist column to the unionist one. - Do moreFor a group of people who are so ostensibly passionate about keeping Scotland in the union, the UK Government is prone to leaving the field of play empty for the Scottish Government to roam free. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack and his team appear to understand the pitfalls of this better than their predecessors, but much of the damage has been done. Unionists should be bolder about planting their flag on Scottish turf, including in devolved competencies, especially when theyrsquove paid for the flagpole ndash a practice which is considered normal in federal countries. - Finally, itrsquos time for a New UnionUnionists are always chasing the curve reacting, panicking, misstepping. They need to make a calm, clinical analysis of where the people of the nations of the UK want to be in  years, and create a positive, proactive vision of a New Unionism which takes us all there. It is, in my view, highly likely to involve both more muscular unionismas well as an enhancement of devolved powers. They can call this federalism, or any other of the myriad terms people use for it ndash it is what it is. But whatever they call it, unionists should understand that New Unionism has a real chance of appealing to many of the soft centrists whom they have pushed towards nationalism. Without it, they will almost certainly lose the next independence referendum.Andy Maciver is Director of Message Matters"},{"url":null,"title":"tories-claim-sturgeon-briefings-snp-party-political-broadcasts","story":"The party said the First Minister had veered off Covid and used the TV broadcasts to score political points, typically against the UK Government, on at least seven occasions.It cited briefings in which Ms Sturgeon referred to the UK Governmentrsquos approach to airbridges as ldquoshambolic, criticised Boris Johnson for remarks on the Scotland-England border, and raised questions about immigration policy.The Tories said the FM hadalso ldquoblasted the UK Governmentrsquos rebranded lsquostay alertrsquo guidance, only to herself adopt an almost identical message weeks later.The attack comes as both Labour and the Tories urgeBBC Scotland to stop airing the briefings, which the opposition claimhave become increasingly ldquopartisan.:BBC urged to drop Sturgeons politicised Covid briefingsLabour has also asked for an urgent meeting with BBC Scotland Director Donalda MacKinnon, arguing the briefings are now a misuse of public money and in breach of the BBC charter.Laboursaid it was wrong the SNP leader was given unprecedented free airtime just  months from a Holyrood election.The briefings cited by the Tories today were mostly ones in which Ms Sturgeon strayed offcoronavirus onto other matters at the direct request of the media.Only one example referred to comments Ms Sturgeon made in her prepared script.On July , she used her scriptedmessage to callthe UK Governmentrsquos decision-making on airbridges as ldquoshambolic.Criticising the UK Governmentforlast-minute changes towhich countries wereexempt from a travel quarantine, she said: ldquoWhen so much is at stake as it is right now, we cant allow ourselves to be dragged along in the wake of other governments, to be quite frank about it, shambolic decision making process.\"So we will take time to properly and rationally consider this before, hopefully very soon, setting out our own decision.The Labour First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, was even more scathing the same day, saying it had been \"impossible\" to a \"sensible answer\" from the UK Government.He told his daily briefing: ldquoDealing with the UK Government over the last few days has been an utterly shambolic experience.The Scottish Government briefings, which were initially held daily but have now been cut to three per week, attract around , viewers across BBC One and BBC Scotland.Support for independence has rise to  per cent since the briefings began, and Ms Sturgeonrsquos personal approval ratings have soared.Mr Johnsons approval ratings have fallenduring the pandemic.:Readers have their say on suggestion to cancel coronavirus briefingsScottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw said: ldquoIt was quite right for the First Minister to embark on these daily briefings at the outset of this crisis, and for them to continue in the months that followed.ldquoBut increasingly, as the statistics have improved and therersquos inevitably less to say about them, the First Minister has turned to political point-scoring.ldquoThis analysis shows how what starts with a daily data update soon descends into an SNP party political broadcast.ldquoShe shouldnrsquot be doing that, and the BBC shouldnrsquot be indulging it.ldquoEither Nicola Sturgeon reverts to this being purely a factual event, or the corporation takes a stand and refuses to give her the airtime.BBC Scotland said: ldquoWe are broadcasting Scottish Government briefings on the pandemic ad the easing of lockdown because these are matters of signicant public interest.ldquoWhile cases of infection may be decreasing from their peak during the pandemic, there remains a valid editorial justication for reporting public health information and asking questions on new developments, such as the recent clusters in the Borders and Lanarkshire.ldquoThe briefings in Scotland are covered by BBC one -

Its basic constituents are cheap and abundant in the UK, but the benefit for the environment is that making lsquonewrsquo product from glass culletrequires far less energy. So bottle banks prolerated everywhere, often placed at supermarkets to attract families when they came for the weekly shop.When kerbside recycling was introduced two decades ago, performances shot upbut it should be recognised that using aluminium and steel cans for beverages, and the pubs moving away from bottled mixers to aerated cordials meant fewer glass bottles being used in recent years.The Scottish Government has recently spent a lot of time and money promoting a proposed Deposit Return Scheme, designed to recover more plastic containers with an additional benefit of ldquoreducing litter .Every beverage containerwill carry a p deposit. This deposit will only be reclaimable at ldquoauthorised refunders so not every shop selling beverages will also refund deposits. If you live some distance away from an authorised refunder, it might not always be convenient for you to recover the deposits. Some commentators suspect that those who depend on public transport to get around might simply not bother, but therersquos always the safety net that the more responsible householders will continue to use their kerbside recycling services for glass, plastic and aluminium containers. That, however, doesnrsquot address the issue of these customers having paid an extra p container that they might not always be able to redeem.But the devil is in the detail: the deposit is to be p irrespective of capacity: a multipack of  cans will carry a deposit six times that of the equivalent volume available in larger plastic bottles. The plastic industry has estimated that this approach will actually result in more plastic bottles being used, the very opposite of what the scheme is designed to achieve. Germany has already implemented a similar scheme and reports a % increase in plastic bottle consumption.Eventhe proposed scheme does work, there seems to have been little thought given to what will happen to the ed beverage containers .

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer. Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel. If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing. Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport. Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond. The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful. They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff. Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing. “We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping. “You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.”The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked. They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place. Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

HMRC has said it is important that new parents claim as soon as they can to receive the maximum support available.Usually, to claim Child Benefit parents must register their child’s birth first.

If they haven’t registered the birth because of COVID#, they should add a note with their claim to let us know.If they already claim Child Benefit, they can complete the form or add their new-born’s details over the telephone on   . They will need their National Insurance number or Child Benefit number.Angela MacDonald, director general for customer services, HMRC said: “It’s really important that parents remember to claim Child Benefit, not just for the payments which we hope will provide vital support at this time, but also so they don’t miss out on National Insurance credits that help protect their State Pension.“In addition, it helps children to get their National Insurance number automatically at .

Holidays to Spainrsquos mainland were were already cancelled from Sunday July  up to and including Sunday August .ldquoAll customers due to travel to Spanish destinations between Sunday July  and Sunday August  will be able to cancel or amend their holiday and will be able to receive a full refund or the option to rebook their holiday with a booking incentive, TUI UK said.The company added: ldquoThe UK Government must work closely with the travel industry as this level of uncertainty and confusion is damaging for business and disappointing for those looking forward to a well-deserved break.Jet also said that it was cancelling flights to a raft of destinations in Spain from Tuesday after the FCO announcement.Rory Boland, Which  travel editor, said: ldquoThis is the third announcement wersquove heard from the Government regarding travel to Spain in the last three days. Hundreds of thousands of UK holidaymakers in Spain or about to fly are utterly confused.Labour said the Government must abandon its one-size-fits-all approach and introduce sectoral support for struggling businesses to ensure that public health measures like the change in quarantine rules for people ing from Spain do not lead to mass job losses.Labourrsquos shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: ldquoThe Governmentrsquos handling of this issue has been nothing short of chaotic. The airline industry and passengers need clarity. vw,vw,px, px\"A British Airways plane lands at Heathrow in London, as new quarantine measures for international arrivals come into force ldquoThe Government must focus support on the sectors that desperately need it, like aviation, aerospace and its supply chain, which supports almost a quarter of a million jobs, with strict climate conditions and ensuring the gains are shared with the public.The announcement of the Governmentrsquos new Spanish travel warnings came after Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos official spokesman said decisions on border measures and travel advice ldquocan be changed rapidlynecessary to help stop the spread of the disease.He went on: ldquoUnfortunately no travel is risk-free during this pandemic and disruption is possible and so anyone travelling abroad should be aware that our travel advice and exemption list is under constant review as we monitor the international situation.The announcement happened amid fears more European holidays could be thrown into disarray this summer with reports of potential new coronavirus lockdowns in France and Germany.Meanwhile, the Government has refused to comment on reports that quarantine for people arriving from Spain or other countries with high coronavirus levels could be cut to ten days under plans being looked at by ministers.Returned travellers would need to quarantine for eight days before being tested, and then only remain in quarantine for another two days should they test negative.The paper reports the Government is also considering instructing everyone who has ed from Spain since July  to get tested.copy -.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappIf you have already travelled to Spain prior to Saturday, the UK Government#s advice is that you should continue your holiday andhome as planned. By Richard WilliamsJuly   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailIf you have already travelled to Spain prior to Saturday, the UK Government#s advice is that you should continue your holiday andhome as planned. However, we would encourage these holidaymakers to proactively contact their travel insurance provider to see what cover they will receive while they remain on holiday.Holidaymakers in Spain, who wish to change their travel plans andto Northern Ireland earlier than planned, should immediately speak with their airline provider, tour operator or travel agent to see what options are available.Holidaymakers who are yet to travel to Spain should think very carefully about travelling, as most travel insurance policies will now be invalid due to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’supdated advice.Since Monday, the Balearic and Canary Islands have also been added to the list of areas where all non-essential travel should be avoided, so the same applies.You are entitled to a full refundyour airline cancels your flight.However, despite the FCO’s advice, many airlines are still flying to Spain, andthis is the case you are not entitled to a refund — but most airlines are allowing passengers to rebook without a fee, or offering vouchers for future travel instead.Therefore we would encourage all passengers to contact their airline to discuss the options that are available to them.Overall, your travel rights depend on whether you have booked flights, or whether you have booked a package holiday.For package holidays, the Package Travel Regulations  entitle you to a refundthe holiday cannot go ahead as planned.Holidaymakers need to be cautious about booking future travel abroad.The FCO’s recent change in travel advice has shown that things can change rapidly.Passengers need to think what will happen to them, or their money,they cannot, or do not want to travel.Consumers requiring further help or advice can contact The Consumer Council on Freephone    or email contact@consumercouncil.org.uk.You can also visit The Consumer Council’s dedicated webpage for travel affected by COVID- at www.consumercouncil.org.uk coronavirus.Richard Williams is head of transport policy at The Consumer Council  Belfast   Related Content and Edith Mikutenaite, who live in Newtownabbey, leave Belfast International Airport after arriving from Barcelona yesterday\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   and Edith Mikutenaite, who live in Newtownabbey, leave Belfast International Airport after arriving from Barcelona yesterday\"Coronavirus PremiumPain in Spain for local travel firms sparks call for bailoutThe Chancellor has been urged to consider introducing financial support for the travel industry here after Spain was suddenly dropped off the air bridge safe list.Most ReadCommunity in shock after two men and a woman killed in Portglenone crashDUP#s Gregory Campbell accused of mocking Irish language after #crass and despicable# social media postActivists #evict# Far-Right Irish party as it sets up stall in centre of BelfastCoronavirus:  test positive for Covid following karaoke party held at Limavady houseCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Executive to examine support for those facing quarantine afterfrom Spain,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This year, though, there was a real threat of #The Port# being the town that was all dressed up with nowhere to go.There had been no fanfare Easter weekend opening of family favourite Barry#s Amusements. The caravan parks were shut, hotels closed and apartments unavailable to visitors.Today there are still no screams of fright and delight, as the doors remain firmly shut on the famous old building that has attracted fun lovers through the decades. There#s no ride on the old ghost train. Copper coins will find a dferent home instead of the slots in the arcade.But where in the town the sparkle is starting to .The mums are back, tissues in hand to mop up dribbles of ice-cream from small faces. All the seats along the seafront are taken for a welcome breath of fresh north coast air. If anything, the town is busier than during last July#s Open. No golf to distract, no Barry#s to chuck p coins into those slots in the hope of winning a clatter of copper. Instead, visitors are nose to tail along the main street, and it#s come just in the nick of time for the shops and cafes.Andy Hill has been running Troggs Surf Shop since  and said Monday was one of the best he can remember.It#s incredibly busy. It#s all domestic custom, we#ve hardly seen a foreign tourist, he said.The beaches are very busy indeed. A lot of people were probably going stir crazy at home and just needed to see the ocean and get some salt water therapy.We#re selling an awful lot of body boards, surfboards and wetsuits. The beach is a natural asset that we have and it#s great to see people using it. Of course it#s a huge disappointment that Barry#s isn#t open, but people seem to be making the best of it, and thankfully the weather is helping.Monday was probably one of the busiest days I#ve ever had here. If everyone did holiday at home every year it would be a marvellous boost to the whole economy. Some will be quite surprised when they come here. A lot of visitors have been telling us what a brilliant time they#re having on the north coast.Along the street, Alice Rohdich presides over the family jewellers and souvenir shop, which has been in business since  and has never known a time like it.We#re missing the tourists from further afield, but we#re certainly making up for it with homegrown visitors, she said. The town has had to evolve this year. We can#t change what#s happening.We did invest in more Irish souvenirs this year as we#d expected more people from overseas on the back of the golf last year, but that hasn#t happened. But thankfully we#re getting our share of what#s going and we#re feeling much more positive. We would previously have had early morning and late evening trade, but now, with plenty of day trippers, the middle of the day is when most arrive. You can#t really visit Portrush without grabbing a stick of rock and Ann Lamont has been selling sweets and confectionery at Wilma#s just across from Barry#s.It has really picked up this last week, she said. We do sell some Irish souvenirs, but that#s not what people from Northern Ireland are after and that#s who we#ve had in the town.But they#re still able to get their sweets, buckets and spades.The weather has been good and usually, especially at nighttime, Barrys would be a big draw for us. Most of my family have worked in there at some stage.A few miles# drive along the Atlantic coast, Portstewart has always been known as a quieter seaside town than its neighbour, but it has reawakened with vigour over the past two weeks.There#s the usual crawl of traffic along the ocean front. Across the bay the sun glints once again off the cars lining the famous Strand. Orderly queues form outside the many ice-cream parlours. There are smiles again on faces as they take good of the fresh sea air. And customers are like a breath of fresh air, too, for the myriad of seafront shops.It#s great to have the doors open again and see people out and about again, said Siobhan Farthing at home and lestyle shop A Broader Picture.We#re obviously having to keep numbers down in the shop, but it#s such a relief to get the doors open again. There#s a real psychological boost to being by the sea and so many people have told us they#re delighted to be back.Missing out on their day by the seaside, though, were face coverings. Few and far between along the proms, it seems a decent face mask might be considered a hindrance to getting the full benefit of the sea air.

Northern Ireland will be the first part of the UK to have a contact tracing app.Health officials are working hard to prevent a second deadly surge of the virus, which has claimed more than  lives since it first arrived here. However, concerns have been raised about a lack of information over the location and extent of emerging clusters, particularly as shielding is due to be paused on Friday.Health officials have provided some information to the public about clusters, but have so far only confirmed the location of the cluster arising from the karaoke party.The PHA revealed that since the start of the Limavady cluster  cases have been added to the contact tracing database, while  contacts had been identied.Read More Limavady Covid- spike linked to microphone passed around at house party karaoke sessionThe PHA declined to provide any further information, stating that it may result in people being identied. This is despite growing calls for clarity over the location of clusters to enable the public, particularly those most at risk from the virus, to take additional measures to protect themselves when it is active in their community.Alliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw, a member of the Stormont health committee, said: I recognise the challenge for the PHA in ensuring that patient confidentiality is assured as part of the contact tracing process and we now have good evidence that contact tracing is fundamentally working in identying and following up clusters.Nevertheless, in a public health emergency we must also have public information so that the public can make decisions about how to go about their daily lives safely.I would still wish to see more information about the locality of clusters immediately when they are identied, and about the nature of clusters in due course, so we can identy clearly what specic activities are leading to #superspreading#.Shielding is pausing on Friday for the , people who were warned their lives are at riskthey become ill with Covid-.They have received limited advice about what is safe from Friday, which includes a recommendation that they should continue to work from home where possible. At the same time it has emerged that  clusters have been identied here since May , with more expected in the coming months.

It has also opposed the extradition from the Republic to Lithuania of Liam Campbell, found liable in a civil court for the  Omagh bomb.The IFP, which was established in  and supports controlled immigration, describes its primary objective as re-establishing the national independence and sovereignty of Ireland and restoring its national democracy by leaving the European Union.It was contacted for a comment but had not responded by the time of going to press.Police are investigating the incident.

The humourous bit was that he was supposed to have spoken Irish with a German accent.I vill not be tempted to ask vot is dis curried yoghurt mein herr.In  Mr Campbell was barred from addressing the Northern Ireland Assembly for a day after making similar remarks at Stormont.He began an address to the assembly with Curry my yoghurt can coca coalyer.He was aping the Irish go raibh maith agat, Ceann Comhairle, which translates as thank you, Speaker and is used by some MLAs in the chamber.Mr Campbell refused to apologise for his words in  and was criticised by then Speaker Mitchel McLaughlin for a breach of standards.

While many under his post commented with laughing emojis others asked why he thought he should mock the language.Sinn Fein MLA Emma Sheerin said Mr Campbell was attempting to mock the Irish language and identity with the post.“Comments posted on social media by DUP MP Gregory Campbell attempting to mock the Irish language and identity are crass, offensive and despicable, The Mid Ulster MLA said“Sadly, this is not the first time Gregory Campbell has insulted the Irish language community with his offensive anti-Irish mockery, these comments are reminiscent of .“When the Assembly was restored in January, DUP leader Arlene Foster said identities should be respected. Perhaps Gregory Campbell needs to reflect on the words of his party leader.“It is long past the time that disrespect like this is allowed to go unchallenged and time the DUP genuinely embraced equality and respect.”The DUP has been approached for comment. SDLP MLA Cara Hunter called for Mr Campbell to apologise for the comments. “This is not the first time that Gregory Campbell MP has made crass and offensive comments of this nature, which are intended to insult the Irish language community, the East Londonderry MLA said. It is not the first time and likely not the last time. However, as unsurprising as these comments are, it is important that they are challenged.”“Gregory Campbell should remember that he was recently re-elected to serve the whole community, right across East Derry. He should apologise for these hurtful remarks and reflect on his tone going forward.”Belfast Most ReadCommunity in shock after two men and a woman killed in Portglenone crashDUP#s Gregory Campbell accused of mocking Irish language after #crass and despicable# social media postActivists #evict# Far-Right Irish party as it sets up stall in centre of BelfastCoronavirus:  test positive for Covid following karaoke party held at Limavady houseCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Executive to examine support for those facing quarantine afterfrom Spain,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty"},{"url":null,"title":"i found love through a dating agency now im the matchmaker","story":"descriptionpinPlease confirm to access your content OK\",template_summary: Order summaryNeed help  Contact Customer CareAccountBillingConfirmation.epplans:not .epplans-more .eporder-box.-new .eporder.is-new .eporder-box.-new .eporder.is-new .eporder-box.-select .field .StripeElement .field .StripeElement--focus #fp-payment-form .button selected_price\" class\"-as: -c:dt -fw:\"View other plansother_pricesSelect payment methodNew Cardother_payment_optionsPayment detailsCard NumberExpiration DateCVVComplete paymentLockSecure transaction\" class\"-as: -c:dt -fw:\"ArrowleftSelect a dferent payment method,template_summary_coupon_code: \"Coupon Codecoupon_validationRedeem Code\",template_summary_coupon_code_applied: \"\",template_premium_fadeout: \"\",template_redeem_coupon_code: Redeem your SubscriptionEnter your code here\" required\"\"The access code entered is not valid.

I found them very professional and confidential and the end result was that I met my partner Paula, he said. Having found his own perfect match, Paul is keen to help other men in the same position and is applying  years worth of skills in business ownership, management, customer care and relationship building to help in their search for the one.He#ll also be helping men become Mr Right, and his advice will be more vital than ever for clients anxious about the daunting prospect of going back to face-to-face dates post-lockdown.Given my own positive experience I felt that I could offer a lot to the company in terms of seeing things from a man#s perspective. I#ve been single, married, separated and met the new love of my le, so I#ve experienced it all, Paul said. If a person of my age can meet someone new, it shows that le is certainly not over and that there#s hopefully a match for everyone. I#ll take them under my wing, talk them through the process, answer any questions and calm their fear, which is always the biggest thing holding people back.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Father La rises in the morning at around .am for early morning Mass. Less than an hour later, he is under an open sky as birds fly overhead undertaking the Stations in his bare feet leaving solitary footprints where before many soles left their imprint on the earth. Housemartins A station takes around an hour and ten minutes to do and Father La does so under the swooping wings of the Housemartins amidst a backdrop of blooming nature during these calm but drizzly mornings. googletag.cmd.push At am, the boatmen come onto the island. Each day Thomas Gallagher from Ballyshannon, Reece McGrath from Pettigo and Joe Sheeran from Mountcharles arrive on the island and undertake their own work. They leave at pm. “Really, I can hardly remember the last time in my le I was lonely. I am at ease with my own company,” he said. As they leave the island, Father La is well into his day. “I would be hard pushed to find a time when I have been busier. “People are afraid that I am bored but I’m not. The team are exceptionally busy, they have been putting so much work into alternative ways to keep in touch with pilgrims. We have set ourselves to be in outreach mode,” he said. googletag.cmd.push In the evening, Father La goes up to the Basilica for night prayer. “My thoughts are to honour the rhythm of the pilgrimage season,” he says. This year, those affiliated with the island are busy in new and alternate ways. Father La said that many people have been sending petitions to those on the island: “We get a lot of people who send us petitions asking for prayer for this or that,” Father La said. In his prayers, he remains faithful to those people and the heartfelt petitions that they have undertaken to write and to send to the island. Virtuous pilgrimage On the last weekend in June, Father La invited people to do the full pilgrimage with him from wherever they were. It was not a virtual pilgrimage, he said, but a virtuous one and people did fast and pray asthey were on the island. People signed up online to participate. Father La recalls that the pilgrimage was one where they were not blessed with favourable weather. “The rain was horizontal. It was driving rain and constant wind. “It was relentless during the night. On Saturday we got through reasonably well,” he said. Those who participated were bestowed with a certicate which carries the Lough Derg seal and are signed by the prior. All of the certicates had to be sent out by the team to those who participated. A pilgrimage season did not take place on the island in  as result of a dispute with boatmen. However, many more pilgrims came to the island the following year. Pilgrimage path There is now a newly refurbished path on the lake shore of Lough Derg. The path which was recently relaunched would have been used by pilgrims in the medieval times. In the s pilgrims from as far away as Spain, Italy and Hungary used part of this trail as they made their way to what medieval Europe knew of as St Patrick’s Purgatory. Work was being carried out on the path before the pandemic struck and six new boards were designed and ready to go when the lockdown came into effect. There are now six display boards which bring to le the story of the Pilgrim Path and those who walk the path can enjoy stopping to read the boards. Father La said that the ‘full walk’ is around k along the shore road and to Saints Island. “We went to the point where pilgrims used to cross to Saint’s Monastery where they were given hospitality before being brought to Station Island,” he said. People can also take a shorter loop and everyone can do the walk at their own pace. Some people like to do it in soft contemplation and reflection whilst other people like to absorb the surroundings. Many people enjoy taking photographs in the historic and picturesque surroundings. “I led two guided groups on Saturday and Sunday,” he said. Numbers were limited as a result of the Covid- church and State guidelines, those who took part enjoyed it. One-day retreat Father La said that it remains to be seen whether a one-day retreat will take place on the island this year. “It remains to be seen whether we can open for a one-day retreat at this time,” he said. However, a meeting for the matter to be discussed will take place before the end of the week. August  It is expected that Father La will remain on the island until August . Enjoying his own company, reflection and prayer, Father La seems content during this year’s traditional pilgrimage time. He has now become familiar with a goose who comes onto the island to graze in the grass. The goose can be found behind St Mary’s, at times, and when startled will take off honking at great speeds, at times.

The Derry Central Library in Foyle Street is one of just five libraries from across the North which were chosen to be part of a pilot scheme to allow customers back in. Branch Library Manager, Koran Burns, said people were delighted toto the facility, which shut on March .

We have had a steady stream of visitors at the Central Library since it reopened and people have told us they feel very safe due to all the measures we have introduced. Staff are there to greet people as they come in the door and we have provided hand sanitiser. There are also screens at the desks and lots of customer signage. Any books that are ed will be stored for  hours before they are put back on the shelves. Customers are being asked to keep a social distance and limit their time on the computers or browsing for books to half an hour. There are also self service machines for borrowing books. In addition, all surfaces in the library will be regularly cleaned. We are asking customers to help us keep the computer stations clean by providing sanitising wipes to wipe them down before and after they use them, said Mrs Craig.

Mrs Craig said the opening hours have also been changed to allow the library to close for  hoursbefore reopening on a Tuesday morning for vulnerable people.

Customers can phone their local library during dedicated hours to request books and then arrange a suitable time for a contactless collection, explained Mrs Craig. A customer can view our online catalogue and checka particular book they are interested in is available in their local library, they will then phone and speak with a member of staff who will set it aside and arrange a day and time for them to come in and collect it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He will not be able to call on Shane Lagan after the long-serving defenders retirement. Also gone is Conor McGurk who is still in Australia following the coronavirus pandemic. One man who is back in the fold is Paddy Henry, who has played just one game since the clubs  intermediate championship win. Lavey won the minor football and hurling double last season, but due to the young age profile of the team only minor football skipper Cormac Collins and Ryan McGill have graduated to the senior ranks. googletag.cmd.push He acknowledges the work going on around the club, referencing the U success and a useful U group. “From my point of view, I wish they would come through a bit quicker,” McGarvey jokes. While this weekends opponents have been busy with challenge games, Lavey had just Sundays draw with Carrickmore to help their championship preparation. “Thats all we are going to take,” the Lavey boss stressed, rolling out the names of the dual players in his plans. Fintan Bradley, Dara McPeake, Aidan Toner, the McGill brothers , Liam and Colm Murphy. “I envisage  of our team will be dual players. They wont all start on the football team, but they are aiming to play both,” predicts McGarvey, who leads the management team of Simon Wilson, Ben Dodds, Adie McGill and Mark Hearty. googletag.cmd.push “You are not going to know until you start playing. The boys were glad to get out, but we have a tough schedule because nearly all our players are dual players. We were going four or five times a week and we had to cut it back on them.” On the other side of the coin, Dee Doherty is back in charge of Na Magha, eight years after helping them to an Ulster final where they went down to Bredagh. Galway native Tomaacutes Lally, who has transferred from London club St Gabriels, joins him on the management team. “We are trying to build, like other clubs and counties are doing, to try and progress,” said Doherty, who knows the hurling scene well in his role as physio with Derry senior hurlers. “We want to rise up from being Na Magha, the junior team in Derry. It is a game we are looking forward to, with the incentive of it being your first game at home. We know it is Lavey and we know what we are up against.” It will be a chastening experience for his young side, with many of them going straight in against senior clubs in their first year of adult hurling. Many of his squad work in the retail sector, so balancing shts around training has proved dficult. In a  or  day spell Doherty has juggled challenge games with Donegal sides Burt, St Eunans, Setanta and Buncrana. “We have not been able to get the same team out for any of the games,” said Doherty, who was happy to be working with a group of  plus players. “Of that, nine are first year minors and cant play, but we are thinking down the line to next year and the year after. I have never saw numbers like that at Na Magha in my le,” he said. Having their own base is important, but Doherty points to the efforts of Ciaran McCarron and the coaches who have nurtured the upcoming minor squad. “There is a good group of players there that are interested in playing. You are trying to mix them with the older boys. We want to progress into the intermediate level, thats the aim. “For us to win anything this year, we are going to have to beat one of the senior clubs in the county. If we could win one championship game this year, it would be a result for us and that is the target we set out for ourselves.” It will be a long-term project and continuity will be the key. Home advantage will give Na Magha a familiar surrounding, but Lavey should head back down the Glenshane pass with the points. VERDICT: Lavey RELATED- Sean Leos masterclass not enough to clinch Coleraine win.

Ballyhales fabric was well-tested on an afternoon of drama at Paacuteirc Esler. After the game, a relieved Henry Shefflin told reporters his side was put to the pin of their collar, while Michael McShane believed there was still an All-Ireland in the Slaughtneil side. It wont be this season. The GAA omitted the provincial and All-Ireland club competitions from theirto play roadmap. Michael McShane didnt comment on the decision that would prevents his side from defending their title, should they emerge from Derry. googletag.cmd.push “You are only in the position to question thatyou are county champions,” he stated of the GAAs decision. “Like every other year, we just focus on winning Derry, thats the first hurdle. To seewe are good enough to do that and complete eight-in-a-row. If nothing  happens, we will have retained our county title and it will be a good year.” The seeding from last years league placings keeps them apart from a Kevin Lynchs side that have been snapping on their heels in recent seasons. The first challenge is Ballinascreen, who pushed the Lynchs every step of the way in last years championship. It took a late Niall Ferris goal to seal the deal, but it wasnt before a Reece McSorley goal and a point from Aaron Kelly had Screen well in the hunt. googletag.cmd.push Cathal McDaid s as manager, with Danny McGrellis, Hugh Pat Kelly, Michael James Groogan and Dave McGurk in the management team. Their new intake of minors includes Niall Doyle, Ronan McKenna, James O’Connor, Emmett Donnelly and Jamie Murray, but theywill be without the injured Ciaran McBride. The Emmets welcome back Paul McNeill after a -month lay-off with a shoulder injury. Liam Cassidys knee injury has recovered and Prionsias Burke has ed from a year studying in Liverpool. “You wouldve thought he had never been away,” said McShane of McNeills , which will also be welcome news for football boss Paul Bradley. “Hewas just so pleased and happy to get back at it. We are in a good position this year, with Paul, Liam and Prionsias all adding to the strength of the . “You were looking at a summer with nothing, but its great to get back as a group in each others company.” In previous seasons, the Slaughtneil football and hurling training schedule was dependent on the next game and what code needed the immediate focus. This year, both teams are going to continue training when possible during the groups, according McShane, before prioritising ahead of the knock-out stages. “Pauland myself are talking very regularly to keep on top of it, so that we are not overworking the lads.” highlighted McShane, who has retained the same management team that includes Alex Campbell, Noel Brick, Bernard Cassidy, Barney and Patrick McEldowney. “It has all been very good so far. The players are happy and the football management is happy,” he added. The players were upbeat about theirto action after the lay-off,while stressing the importance of players taking responsibility for their own health and checking their temperature regularly in the midst of the training programme. “As the saying goes, you never miss the water til the well runs dry. I hope and pray to God we can get on with it, there will be no issues and we can enjoy a summer of hurling and football like we normally do.” In the world of a condensed season and a raft of dual players, an early win will dilute the importance ofgroupgames further down the track. Its hard to look past an early Slaughtneil victory. VERDICT: Slaughtneil RELATED- Early goals make the dference for Kevin Lynchs.

On the flip side, he wasnt happy with the opening  minutes, when he felt their shot selection and decision making left a lot to be desired. “When we went out after the water break, that next  minutes was when we really hit top gear and we were awesome, hitting - to no reply to effectively kill the game,” he said of their - to - victory. McShane was pleased with how his side built on their - to - interval lead against the breeze in the second half. googletag.cmd.push Like their footballers, Slaughtneil have been used to playing on their more expansive bottom pitch, which was being rested in the off-season. “We were playing on a tighter pitchthan Owenbeg and you have to work that bit harder to make the space and we did create it in the second quarter,” McShane added, while stressing how well Ballinascreen got in around them. In the second half, Brendan Rogers added a fourth goal before Jerome McGuigan grabbed - inside two minutes in another purple patch from the champions. “I thought Jerome was absolutely awesome,” McShane said. “I know he ended up with a red card for a moment of madness on his part and it is something he will learn from. googletag.cmd.push “I thought his performance up to that was absolutely top class, he was absolutely unplayable and thats why he came in for a bit of harsh, up close and personal treatment...they had no other way of stopping him. “He made an unbelievable run in the first half and he left them all in his wake. He had bad luck when we tried to finish it and it hit the keeper.” Slaughtneil appeared to pull their half forward line deeper to maximise space and on top of Cormac ODohertys - tally, he was picking passes and dictating the game. “I always felt there was an extra  or  percent we could we get out of Cormac,” McShane stated. “This year he has stepped up and we are getting that. “I thought he was fantastic...his vision, his link play and his ability in the rucks to come out with the ball is second to none. He is the new captain of the team, he has that responsibility on his shoulders and he seems to be thriving on it and long may it continue.” RELATED- Slaughtneil ease to opening win of the season.

On the flip side, he wasnt happy with the opening  minutes, when he felt their shot selection and decision making left a lot to be desired. “When we went out after the water break, that next  minutes was when we really hit top gear and we were awesome, hitting - to no reply to effectively kill the game,” he said of their - to - victory. McShane was pleased with how his side built on their - to - interval lead against the breeze in the second half. googletag.cmd.push Like their footballers, Slaughtneil have been used to playing on their more expansive bottom pitch, which was being rested in the off-season. “We were playing on a tighter pitchthan Owenbeg and you have to work that bit harder to make the space and we did create it in the second quarter,” McShane added, while stressing how well Ballinascreen got in around them. In the second half, Brendan Rogers added a fourth goal before Jerome McGuigan grabbed - inside two minutes in another purple patch from the champions. “I thought Jerome was absolutely awesome,” McShane said. “I know he ended up with a red card for a moment of madness on his part and it is something he will learn from. googletag.cmd.push “I thought his performance up to that was absolutely top class, he was absolutely unplayable and thats why he came in for a bit of harsh, up close and personal treatment...they had no other way of stopping him. “He made an unbelievable run in the first half and he left them all in his wake. He had bad luck when we tried to finish it and it hit the keeper.” Slaughtneil appeared to pull their half forward line deeper to maximise space and on top of Cormac ODohertys - tally, he was picking passes and dictating the game. “I always felt there was an extra  or  percent we could we get out of Cormac,” McShane stated. “This year he has stepped up and we are getting that. “I thought he was fantastic...his vision, his link play and his ability in the rucks to come out with the ball is second to none. He is the new captain of the team, he has that responsibility on his shoulders and he seems to be thriving on it and long may it continue.” RELATED- Slaughtneil ease to opening win of the season.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation. Take a trip with confidence Northern Ireland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer. Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. googletag.cmd.push The national tourist organisations of Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation. Summer is here and the United Kingdom is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much-needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. googletag.cmd.push Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation. But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines. Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months. “They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry. “All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe. “But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.” Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps. When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel. If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book. Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem. Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing. Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport. Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.  LUXURY STAY: Beannchor Group managing director Bill Wolsey at the Merchant Hotel Relax in five-star luxury Social distancing measures aren’t the only change visitors are experiencing at Belfast’s five-star Merchant Hotel. The hotel has used lockdown time to complete its pound, investment of the Great Room Restaurant and Cocktail Bar. The management team is confident that customers will benefit from, but not be inconvenienced by, the Covid- compliant changes it has also made. The Great Room has been reimagined to create a standalone restaurant and the Cocktail Bar has also benefited from signicant refurbishment. Other venues within the Beannchor Group portfolio have also opened their doors. Beannchor Group managing director Bill Wolsey said: “We’re aware that customers and guests may be curious about the experience that awaits them and, while there are measures in place that follow the scientic guidelines and industry best practice to ensure the safety of our staff and customers at all times, we have striven to minimise the impact to the overall experience at all our venues.” Camping perfect for keeping distance Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond. Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping. “You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked. They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place. Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular. middot Wales is open for camping from  July.  Courtesy of Cool Camping Extra measures in place so you can embark on a lakeside holiday Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond. The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful. They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures. They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff. Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing. “We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner. “There are a lot of positive health implications of being outside and on the water.”  LOCH LOMOND: Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened self-catering properties and cruises For more information on staying safe, please go to www.discovernorthernireland. _CoronavirusPHutm_mediumdisplayutm_sourceMediaForceutm_contentxframingdclidCOvM_IeoCFQzwQodkcEARw\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noopener\" --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, where Limavady is situated, experienced the largest surge in cases, with an extra  since last Wednesday. A mobile testing unit, situated on the Greystone Road, was deployed to the area in response to the cluster. Only one more case was recorded in the Mid Ulster area, but Derry and Strabane saw fourteen new cases, bringing its total to . Ten local GAA clubs suspended activities as a precautionary measure in response to the cluster, with only St Mary’s GAC, Banagher, confirming a positive case within their members. googletag.cmd.push A club spokesperson said: “All relevant people have been contacted and the Public Health Agency will contact any club memberthey feel there is a concern. “We will keep you up to date of any information received from them. “The GAA has advised the club to continue as normal, although we have decided to cancel all underage training until further notice.” A shop in Claudy, part of the Derry and Strabane district, has also confirmed a member of its staff is currently in isolation after testing positive for Covid-. In a statement, posted online, Centra Claudy said other members of staff have volunteered for testing. googletag.cmd.push “Whilst we do have one staff member who has tested positive for Covid- they are in isolation since they had the test and are following public health advice,” they said. “The public health authority did not contact any of our other staff for testing via track  trace although some have volunteered for testing and all results to date have ed negative. “We can assure you that we have been following very strict Covid guidelines since we entered this pandemic in March. “Our staff have worked tirelessly to provide a service for the local area, and we have appreciated the support  patience from our community in following guidelines when shopping.” A ‘local lockdown’ have been enforced in Leicester, England, after a surge in positive cases, and the Department of Health said the strategy would be ‘considered’ in Northern Ireland. “With lockdown restrictions being eased it is likely that we will see clusters and outbreaks of Covid-,” a DoH spokesperson said. “In circumstances where the number of cases continues to increase a range of measures will be considered, including the introduction of local lockdownsnecessary and depending on the circumstances as they arise.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Caoimhe Archibald. East Derry MLA, Caoimhe Archibald, has urged people not to panic, saying the figures were proof the Test, Trace and Protect system was working. “It is concerning that a cluster has been identied, first and foremost for those iniduals who are affected,” she said. “Hopefully no one is suffering from serious symptoms and will recover quickly, but there is a general concern there in the local community and that’s understandable. “We don’t want people to be alarmed. We have seen the test, trace and isolate system in place, and we can see how that is working. “The cases have been identied and the process is rolling out. That is critical to containing the virus and we see those procedures working effectively. “It’s a timely reminder to us all that we can’t become complacent, that we do need to remain vigilant and practise public health guidance in terms of social distancing, good hygiene and cough etiquette.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last year, the Education Authorityproposed discontinuing Groarty Controlled Integrated Primary School because of the low number of pupils at the school. Groarty is the only integrated school on Derrys cityside. The proposal has now been agreed to by the Minister of Education Peter Weir. It had originally been proposed that the school would close at the end of August . However, the closure date has been extended to August . Mr Weir said: Having weighed up all the information, including the fact that  of the  pupils will be exiting P, with no new intake for - or September , it is clear that unfortunately the school is not sustainable, and that provision for any pupils in an integrated setting can be made where in the city. googletag.cmd.push The school has been a part of the local community for over  years. It attained integrated status in . A final decision regarding its closure was expected to be made by the department and Mr Weir at the beginning of this year. However, the decision was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The number of pupils at the school has fluctuated over time but has not risen above  in the past ten years. Ahead of the   school year - before proposals were announced to close -  pupils enrolled. Following that decision, numerous parents took the decision to transfer their children to other schools which was reflected in enrolment figures of just  for the   school year. googletag.cmd.push The EA proposed closing Groarty Integrated Primary School, situated on the Coshquin Road, at the end of August . Parents were ‘devastated’ when first informed of the plans on April , . Schoolchildren from the school then hand delivered letters to then education chief, Derek Baker, when he visited Derry’s Guildhall imploring him to reconsider. The school has a capacity for  pupils and it was anticipated that by transforming from a controlled primary school to a controlled integrated primary school in  that numbers were going to swell. A consultation received  objections from amongst others the Board of Governors, staff, parents, a local resident and the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education. Points include the fact it is the only integrated primary school in the cityside and considerable distance to the other one, Oakgrove IPS, in the Waterside. The school caters for children with special needs and has a strong shared educational programme with Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige. The case was also made that housing developments are planned for the area which could improve numbers. However, the EA says that other schools close to Groarty, such as Irish Medium School Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige and Catholic Maintained Schools St Eithne’s and Holy Family have many unfilled places. The EA argues that the school ‘does not operate within its in-year budget’, the school’s enrolment falls ‘well short’ of the Sustainable Schools Policy criteria for primary schools, set at  pupils for a rural school and  pupils for an urban school.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Foyle College pupil Katie Smith landed her dream job at innovative Belgravia eaterie Wild by Tart last year at just -years-old. But after seven months in her new position, the restaurant had to shut for lockdown and Katie had to to leave her glamorous London le behind and move back in with her parents on the Limavady Road. Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London.

Former Foyle College pupil Katie Smith landed her dream job at innovative Belgravia eaterie Wild by Tart last year at just -years-old. But after seven months in her new position, the restaurant had to shut for lockdown and Katie had to to leave her glamorous London le behind and move back in with her parents on the Limavady Road. Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added.

Local playwright Brian Foster recently decided to write a poem about the city, following the positive response when he penned a poem about Creggan where he grew up. .However, he wanted to give people an opportunity to help him write the Derry poem. He started the ball rolling by putting the first line of the poem on to the Memories of Creggan Facebook. He then asked people to come up with ideas for the next line of the poem. Through this process, the poem, entitled My Derry Days, was created. googletag.cmd.push Mr Foster said he was delighted with the response to his initiative. “As far as I’m aware, this is the first time a poem has been written in this online manner by any community anywhere in Ireland. Perhaps even further afield,” he said. “The standard of the entries was so high that the hardest bit was selecting the winning line each night from so many brilliant efforts.” Read more about this story and the finished poem in todays Derry News. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Both Irish Cuip semi-finals – Coleraine vs. Ballymena and Cltonville vs. Glentoran - will be played today at Windsor Park, with the final to be played this Friday.But all such talk of red ribbons on the cup is premature for McLaughlin, who is refusing to look beyond the challenge posed by Mick McDermotts Glens today.“We havent really spoken at all about the final,” McLaughlin stated.“I do know how long its been since the club has won the cup and its crazy to think its been that long because we have had so many great sides down the years. We havent even had that conversation with the players because the sole focus is on Monday.“It will be a really tough game against a good side in Glentoran. Mick McDermott has done a really great job with them and he has them playing well, so it sets it up for a good game, an exciting game. Its a game that we feel we can win, but Im sure Glentoran will be saying the same.” googletag.cmd.push Derry interestThere is a real Derry interest in the last four of the competition this year. With Conor McDermott and Michael McCrudden hoping to help McLaughlin to the trophy this weekend, Glentorans Patrick McClean will have other ideas.

Fortunately, a fire, believed to have spread to undergrowth after an attempt was made to set a speed restriction sign alight, did not develop into a large blaze.The volunteers who run the railway mdash who have launched an urgent appeal to raise pound, mdash are particularly concerned about an attempt to force open the main gates they discovered empty beer cans. First aid boxes at the station were also raided for bandages.Damage at the Loop  was discovered during a recent shunt to test rolling stock and carry out essential track maintenance, with the exercise taking place while visitors were banned from the railway due to lockdown restrictions.Railway officials have reported the incidents to police and have appealed to anyone who can assist officers with their enquiries to come forward.The recent incidents come after the coronavirus lockdown had a massive hit on the railwayrsquos finances.In an online post, officials appealed to young people to ldquoleavethem alone and stop trying to destroy the place, also asking parents do they know where their children are and what they are doing.The hard-working volunteers say they have enough on their plate without having to ldquosort out other peoplersquos mess, expressing concern about people walking along the railway lines which they are not allowed to do.Officials say the ldquostupidity of others is the reason why they hope the local community will support their fundraising appeal to help pay for better security as a bid for financial help from the Northern Ireland Executive proved unsuccessful.A recent bid for support from the Department of Communitiesrsquo Covid- Charities Fund to cover costs racked up to maintain the business which has been mothballed due to lockdown restrictions was unsuccessful.Officials fear that the railway will also miss out on securing a slice of a poundm fund for business start-ups and tourist attraction investment which was announced recently.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner recently wrote an open letter highlighting the railwayrsquos plight and its reluctance to ask for help in the current financial climate.He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work.Mr Gardiner said the railway was likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid-.He said that with no income for the rest of the year, the railway faced ldquomajor challenges.Mr Gardiner said given that the railwayrsquos final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont failed, it had reluctantly turned to its members and supporters to ask for help.He added: ldquoWe need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.To date, the railwayrsquos appeal has raised pound,, with anyone interested in making a donation asked to visit www.facebook donate   or text RAIL plus the amount to  or visit www.downrail appeal.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Aarin’s lockdown farm project  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK boy has been enjoying lsquoThe Good Lersquo during the Covid- lockdown.Twelve year-old Aarin Rea has spent the past four months developing a miniature farm, complete with chickens, ducks, doves and even peacocks, in the garden of his Knochnashinna home.Hersquos also growing fruit and vegetables in his allotment and specially built greenhouse, and hersquos also planted apple trees.His family and neighbours will soon be able to share in an abundance of potatoes, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, scallions, broad beans, tomatoes, strawberries and apples, as well as a supply of fresh eggs.Aarinrsquos mum, Karin, says the miniature farm has helped bring the community together during the isolation of lockdown and has lted everyonersquos spirits.ldquoItrsquos all everyone has been talking about lately, she said. ldquoThey are always enquiring as to how the farm is coming along and Aarin couldnrsquot be any prouder at whathe has achieved over the last few months.ldquoAarin has been eager to get out every day to his little farm while he has been off school. He spent the good weather tending and watering his fruit vegetables both in the allotment and in the greenhouse, which his father, Anthony, built for him.Aarin is the proud owner of peacock chicks, which were hatched thanks to a tip from his grandfather, Leslie Rea, who told him to put golf balls underneath the peacocks to encourage them to lay eggs.Aarin, has since given his poultry flock some pretty ingenious names, and he now considers his ducks, James Pond and Quacky Chan, among some of his best friends.Then there are his favourite hens, Henner Lopez, Princess Laya and Fluffy, who are very happy to the strutting around.The newest arrivals are two doves, Holy and Spirit, which are housed in a newly-built dovecote and a turkey chick.However, Aarinrsquos favourite animal is his beloved Jack Russell, Lottie.Aarinrsquos farming skills have come a long way since be began growing potatoes in tubs.ldquoI sell my duck eggs to elderly neighbours who adore their distinct flavour. Our next door neighbour, Tommy Armour, is always giving me little bits of advice to help bring the brood along.

That is absolutely essential.Campaigners added: ldquoThe historic underinvestment in the Ambulance Service has been widely known for years.

If there had have been, the guide would have stopped and taken him down.Jules was later told by the Matterhorn Museum that itrsquos believed he was the youngest person ever to have mastered the peak.Chris, now living with his family in the Scottish Highlands where he and his we Mignonne run a gin distillery, Daffyrsquos, said: ldquoJules has always loved climbing since he was able to walk. Whether it was trees or rocks, he progressed doing indoor climbing walls and roped up climbing outdoors.A former professional snowboarder, Chris grew up on Sketrick Island, near Killinchy, with his parents, Zora and Paul.He developed a love of mountains and climbing as a child in the Mournes and through his schoolrsquos mountaineering club, so it was inevitable he would pass on his passion for the outdoors to Jules and his elder brother,  year-old Louis.ldquoWersquove always climbed as a family but several years ago Jules was asked to do a school project on any subject and he chose to do one on climbing the Matterhorn, explained Chris.ldquoOne day he asked mehe could climb the Matterhorn some time and I said of course, rather thinking it was a joke.ldquoBut Jules really put in the training himself and kept pushing me to take on a hike or a climb. He was always very capable as we have always climbed as a family.Chris said that Jules continued to put the work into building up his skills and stamina for the climb mdash even the Covid- could not defeat the  year-oldrsquos determination to climb the mountain.ldquoWe had lined up an American friend of ours to guide us, but he couldnrsquot travel due to the pandemic so we thought we would go with the local mountain guides.ldquoHowever, they told Jules that he couldnrsquot do it until he was  and after he proved himself. We did a lot of high altitude extreme rock climbs. They watched Jules, saw that he was very capable and decided to give him a shot.While Chris was prepared to try and make his sonrsquos ambition to come true, even he was surprised when they safely made the summit and ed back down without incident.ldquoI donrsquot think I fully expected we would make it to the top, admitted Chris. ldquoJules gave me a hug at the very top and said he couldnrsquot believe he had done it. He thought it was incredible but it did take a while for it to sink in afterwards.While Jules may be eligible for an entry into the Guinness Book of Records, his dad said that accolade is not what Jules was about.ldquoHersquos not a glory hunter in any sense, hersquos just appreciative and proud to have done it.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it. We have consistently argued that the mercury issue is a red herring and nothing we have seen or heard has made us deviate from this position.ldquoSt Johnrsquos is one of the best ventilated lighthouses of its kind and we are opposed to any orce from the current Fresnel lens and its Burdel rotating mechanism.Campaigners say they hope that politicians will seek an urgent, virtual meeting with CIL to ask why their wishes have been ignored and why they were not formally told that the tendering process had begun.The campaign spokeswoman added: ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse boasts what is widely regarded as a rare bit of engineering excellence which we want retained and maintained. The iconic sweeping beam and rotation system must not be lost at the stroke of a pen and consigned to the pages of history.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs. One possibility is that the facade of the current building would be retained, with a new-build at the rear.Council officials say that any plan to redevelop the Central Promenade site will not impact on any part of the promenade at the rear of the building.They insist that they are committed to the Newcastle project and recognise that it has a key role to play, meeting the needs of local people and visitors alike, particularly during inclement weather.It has also been confirmed that local people are to be asked for their views on redeveloping the site as part of a pre-planning application process, to come up with a favourable design.Senior council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.

Please try again later.Submitting...Letter to the editorThe fact that in the second stage debate the primary DUP speaker propagated a  assurance suggests a dearth of consideration by the lead party of unionism. He said, “the “three or more ministers” safeguard remains in place. If ministers are upset or concerned about the implications of a decision that is cross-cutting, three of them are required to ensure that the executive as a whole have a conversation about that decision.”As Richard Bullickpointed out in his powerful article in the News Letter on Friday , this is simply not so. There is no such existing power. Yes, when something gets to the executive three ministers can insist it requires cross-community support. But, there is no power for “three or more ministers” to call something in, despite what Mrs Foster told her committee on st July. It is of itself alarming that the first minister is so misinformed.The right of three ministers to insist on a cross-community vote creates a veto for the DUP , but the supply line to the veto power is cut off by this bill. That is the key point the DUP seems to be missing. Now, any minister can decide matters without recourse to the executive unless it affects the statutory responsibilities of another department “more than incidentally”.So, what was so important at St Andrews to the DUP, is now of no moment. Why It is precisely because the ramications of this bill needed to be teased out in a proper committee stage that I voted against accelerated passage of this legislation. Sadly, I was the only unionist do so. Now, the horse has bolted.Particularly for believers in the absurd Stormont system these should be issues of concern, but seemingly not.Doug Beattie’s amendments seek to limit the change to planning matters. This is sensible. What is not sensible is to use the need for change on planning, flowing from the Buick judgement, to unfetter ministers’ powers across the board.Another option to protect against what may be unintended, but signicant, consequences would, at this late stage, be a petition of concern subjecting the final vote on the bill to cross-community support, that isthe DUP was now to realise what it is doing.Jim Allister QC MLA, Stormont• News story: Crucial ‘veto’ claim now dropped by Arlene Foster, leaked DUP note shows as vote on key bill looms• Doug Beattie: It is madness to hand ministers more unchecked powers, and hard to understand why DUP is backing it • Morning View: MLAs should back Doug Beattie’s amendment today• Richard Bullick: The DUP won key safeguards for unionism, yet seems to be sleepwalking into removing them• News story: Arlene Foster still backs ‘dangerous’ law – but offers no rebuttal of ex-aide’s warning• Sam McBride: With the incurious scrutinising the inept, Stormont is sinking lower into disrepute——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Pic: Steven McAuley McAuley Multimedia“The local community has once again been plunged into sadness – that people have lost their lives at this notorious crossroads.”Two off-duty soldiers on a fishing trip lost their lives in a collision between a car and a tractor at the same crossroads in August .At an inquest the following year, the site was described as having “a collision history” – with motorists sometimes failing to realise they were approaching a junction.PSNI Inspector David Anderson said: “I am appealing to anyone who witnessed this collision, or who may have captured dash cam footage, to contact us on  quoting reference number    .”DUP MLA Mervyn Storey said the community “is reeling with shock and sadness” at reports of the latest tragedy.The North Antrim representative said: “We can’t begin to imagine the shock and hurt for the loved ones of those who have sadly lost their lives.“Any death at any time is heartbreaking but in these sudden and tragic circumstances the grief and pain experienced will be even more profound.”Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan said the local community has been left shocked following the deaths. “People have been shocked, saddened and devastated by the deaths of three people in a road collision near Portglenone,” he said. “This is a terrible blow to all those involved in this incident.“Any death on our roads is one too many and incidents like this are a reminder of the vital importance of road safety,” Mr McGuigan added. The coroner at the time of the  inquest into the deaths of the two soldiers, John Leckey, said: “I always hope something will arise out of a tragedy that will improve matters and may prevent the occurrence of something similar.”At the same inquest, a road traffic collision investigator from Forensic Science Northern Ireland described the junction with Ballyconnelly Road as being clearly marked with signs and road markings however, it was also determined that the soldiers’ car failed to stop at the junction resulting in a collision with a tractor.Lance Corporal David Gwilt from Bedford, and Rleman Dale Harris from Barnsley were declared dead at the scene.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...Introducing the motion, Councillor Sean Clarke said: “I believe the Davagh Dark Sky park contains a number of elements of signicancewhich meet the criteria for designation of a world heritage site.”His party colleague, Councillor Cora Corry described Davagh “as the middle of nowhere and the centre of the universe” and said she would be supportingthe motion.Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Councillor Cathal Mallaghan said the work in Davagh over the last number of years has been “pretty spectacular”.“I think this is the next natural step for Davagh to take. Stonehedge is younger than Davagh and you see the signicanceof places like it, so thank-you for the motion Cllr Clarke,” he said.DUP group leader Councillor Paul McLean thanked Councillor Clarke for amending the motion before bringing it to the floor.“My concern is that this is a very costly process and I would just like to see the whole outworkingof the process,” he said.“I believe there will be a lot of officer input. From what I understand it will be a lot of work, it will be good to get our heads around that and seethere is any funding available that can assist us in that process.”UUP Councillor Robert Colvin commended Councillor Clarke for the eloquencewith which he delivered the motion.“I do welcome the word explore becausethe way it was written initially I was concerned Council would have had no more input, this clarication is much appreciated,” said Councillor Colvin.“This exploration has to take into account the livelihood of people in that area and their ability to develop somewhere close to it, we have to think of the here and now.“Having made those comments, as long as that is taken into account, we would support the motion.”SDLP Councillor Kerri Hughes confirmed her party would be supporting the motion and said such recognitionwould really put Davagh and Mid Ulster as a whole “on the map”.Councillor Mark Glasgow said the key to this was going to be “getting the balance right” between protecting the site and allowing the local economy to grow.“From a planning point of view, something could be brought before committee,” said the UUP Councillor. “To ensure we get the right balance that it doesn’t restrict our development plan or business and the further encouragement of tourism in that area.”His party colleague Councillor Walter Cuddy said his initialreaction was that Councillor Clarke was reaching for the stars with this proposal and said he hoped there was no ulterior motive.“We are a bit concerned of the time and effort that could be involved in this and hope it is not for other planning applications nearby thatwe get this into the pipeline it might effect something nearby,” said Cllr Cuddy.“If we can pull it off great but I have serious doubts. The park is not even open yet. I would have thought this would have been good in a year or two’s time when we have something sell and get out there.“That’s why we feel it is maybe a bit too early.”Ulster Unionist Councillor Derek McKinney also expressed concern in relation to planning.“We have just come out of lockdown andthis was to go forward that would put the surrounding area back into lockdown as far as planning was concerned,” said Cllr McKinney.“There is a wider picture to look at here and we need to look at it and see what the consequences may be before we move forward.”Sinn Fein councillor Sean McPeake said that listening to the last few comments he felt people were a bit unnerved by the proposal.“This proposal does not do away with lighting, development can still occur and I think some of the nervousness is .“I place my trust in Councillor Clarke given his passion for the area.”In conclusion Councillor Clarke thanked the chamber for the opportunity to bring the motion forward.“I thought about this for a long time. The dark sky park area is a limited area,” he said.“I thought it was better to keep it compact so that it does not impact on the surrounding community.”The motion received unanimous support in the chamber.Thanking the chamber and describing the motion as a step forward for Mid Ulster, Councillor Clarke invited everyone in the chamber “to come in the near future and see what is there and what we are talking about”.Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
