It was also reported that Diana picked out the jewel herself, while others claim that she chose it because it was the biggest and reminded her of her mother’s engagement ring.Princess Diana loved her engagement ring so much that she continued to wear it after her orce from Prince Charles in 1996 and it was made into a bracelet. She then started wearing an emerald-cut aquamarine ring in its place, the same one that Meghan Markle wore with her second wedding dress.          Princess Diana loved her engagement ring and continued to wear it after her orcePrincess Diana’s jewellery collectionGrant Mobley, a gemologist and Director at Pluczenik and one of the world’s leading diamantaires, said: ‘A beautiful ring that Princess Diana was seen wearing on her ring finger after her orce from Prince Charles was an emerald cut, aquamarine and diamond ring.He continued: ‘The Princess was very fond of a pearl and diamond bracelet featuring a large emerald cut aquamarine that she was given in her early years as a princess and, after her orce, she commissioned this matching ring to be made.‘Diana’s taste in jewellery was impeccable and the fact that she commissioned this ring to be made is a clear testament to her taste.           Meghan Markle seen here wearing Princess Diana\u0027s aquamarine ring to her wedding reception\u0027She always chose diamond jewellery that was meaningful to her - she was very intentional with her jewellery choices and made sure they were the best representation of those meaningful moments,’ he said, as reported in The Express.The aquamarine ring is thought to be around £75,000 because of the size, colour and quality of the centre diamond and a diamond from one of her rings was also used to make Meghan Markle’s engagement ring.Meghan Markle’s engagement ringDespite including a stone from Botswana and two diamonds from Princess Diana’s personal collection, Meghan Markle’s engagement ring was compared to one available from Argos for just £33. The ring was made by Cleave and Company, Court Jewellers and Medallists for Her Majesty.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle during an official photocall to announce their engagementSarah Filippardos, head jewellery buyer at Argos, told The Sun: \u0027Prince Harry\u0027s choice of a diamond trilogy ring for Meghan is beautiful. For anyone inspired by Harry\u0027s act of romance who isn\u0027t able to pop to Botswana for a diamond, Argos has a fantastic range of similar trilogy engagement rings with prices starting from as little as £32.99.\u0027However, TheDiamondStore.co.uk estimated that it cost £199,475 and the stone is likely to be a D in colour (the clearest). Meghan also paid tribute to her late mother-in-law on her wedding day and wore Diana’s engagement ring to her wedding reception.          Meghan Markle\u0027s ring includes a stone from Botswana and two from Princess Diana’s collectionKate Middleton’s engagement ringWhen Diana passed away in 1997, Prince William and Prince Harry inherited her jewellery collection, which included her engagement ring, according to Good Housekeeping. The late Princess wrote: ‘I would like you to allocate all my jewellery to the share to be held by my sons, so that their wives may, in due course, have it or use it. I leave the exact ision of the jewellery to your discretion.’          Prince William proposed to Kate Middleton with his mother, Princess Diana\u0027s engagement ringThere are rumours that while Harry originally picked out the iconic sapphire gem, after he saw William’s love for Kate Middleton, the Prince exchanged the engagement ring for his mother’s Cartier watch, so that the Duke of Cambridge could propose to this Duchess.          Kate Middleton\u0027s engagement ring is shown as she holds the arm of her fiance Prince WilliamPrince William reportedly had the ring with him for three weeks while they were on holiday in Mount Kenya in 2010 and when he announced the engagement, he said: ‘It’s my mother’s engagement ring, and it’s very special to me, as Kate is very special to me now as well.‘It was only right the two were put together. It was my way of making sure mother didn’t miss out on today and the excitement,’ the Duke said, as reported in Marie Claire. After making a few alterations, Kate’s ring became one of the world’s most famous rings, now worth over $500,000 (£393,000).

She also claimed that the 47-year-old had taken acid before he sent that tweet           Musk described the past year as \u0027excruciating\u0027 and the \u0027most difficult and most painful year of his career\u0027. The interview also raises concerned about Musk\u0027s drug use.

But I was not on weed, to be clear.\u0027 The newspaper reported that Musk had \u0027alternated between laughter and tears\u0027 in the interview and said he had not taken more than a week off work since 2001.He admitted he relied on medication to help him sleep, saying: \u0027It is often a choice of no sleep or Ambien.\u0027According to the New York Times article, board members have noticed that Ambien \u0027contributes\u0027 to his late-night Twitter posts. It says they are also \u0027aware\u0027 that he has occasionally used recreational drugs. Friends are also worried about his health.         The entrepreneur said: \u0027It\u0027s not been great, actually. I\u0027ve had friends come by who are really concerned.\u0027He admitted he had rounded up from $419 to set the possible price, offering an approximate 20 per cent premium over the market value, but said: \u0027Weed is not helpful for productivity. There\u0027s a reason for the word \u0027stoned.\u0027 You just sit there like a stone on weed.\u0027 The surprise tweets caught the eye of the Securities and Exchange Commission, with regulators looking into whether the statements were truthful and why Musk announced them via Twitter.Additionally, Musk and Tesla are being sued by investors who claim the plan to go private was part of a \u0027fraudulent scheme\u0027 to punish short-sellers, or investors who borrow stock in a company with the hope shares will fall. The plaintiffs also allege that Musk\u0027s announcements artificially inflated Tesla\u0027s stock price and violated securities laws. Shares of Tesla were sliding more than 1 percent to $351.80 on Monday morning. Musk attempted to clear up his tweets in the blog post Monday. \u0027Going back almost two years, the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund has approached me multiple times about taking Tesla private,\u0027 Musk wrote in the blog post.     Musk added that investor support was \u0027confirmed\u0027 and that the Tesla board had already met \u0027several times\u0027 in the past few weeks to discuss the proposal to take the firm private\u0027They first met with me at the beginning of 2017 to express this interest because of the important need to ersify away from oil.\u0027They then held several additional meetings with me over the next year to reiterate this interest and to try to move forward with a going private transaction,\u0027 Musk added. Musk\u0027s extra-curricular activities have previously hit the headlines when, earlier this year, he admitted attending a now infamous drug-fueled sex soiree in Silicon Valley in June 2017.

I’d never even thought about that. It was all quite shocking,’ she says. ‘I’m very honest and don’t beat around the bush, but I didn’t expect the amount of vitriol.‘It was like a bomb had gone off. I didn’t even think I had said anything that bad, but I admit that perhaps I didn’t really think about it that much.’Liverpool-born Danielle had three sons, Archie, Harry and George, with her ex husband Jamie O’Hara, the former Tottenham Hotspurs midfielder. The couple orced in 2014. Her fourth son, Ronnie, is with her fiancé, electrician Michael O’Neill.She continues: ‘I want a girl and if I can pay for it, then that’s OK, I can get one.’          The 34-year-old, pictured at home, has received thousands of angry messages on Instagram and Twitter, some of them extreme, on the subject of gender selection for babies  Danielle and fiancé, electrician Michael O’Neill, during her pregnancy with fourth son RonnieIt is, as she has found, a highly controversial stance – which makes it all the more remarkable that Danielle has agreed to address it head-on.The WHO says that sex selection raises ‘serious moral, legal, and social issues’ and can lead to the devaluation of women and gender imbalance.For all the public and official hostility, though, the fact is that the industry is rapidly expanding to meet a huge and growing demand.And if in Britain the demand remains unspoken, in America it is rapidly becoming the norm for those who can afford it.Dr Jeffrey Steinberg at leading US specialists The Fertility Institutes says he routinely treats A-list actors, pop stars and athletes.Tellingly, of 640 couples who came through his doors in 2017, more than one in ten was British.According to Dr Daniel Potter at rival American clinic HRC Fertility, he sees ten patients a month from this country who want to select the gender of their baby.It is, after all, an age-old wish. From cave paintings depicting a preference for sons, to Aristotle’s prescription for producing boys (tying off of the man’s left testicle), attempts to choose the gender of children go back centuries. But Danielle’s decision to obtain – or effectively buy – a baby girl belongs firmly to the scientific realm.She had first heard about the gender selection procedure in the wake of giving birth to Ronnie, now ten months old. Enquiring further, she learnt that the treatment is accurate in 99 per cent of the cases in which a baby is successfully born and started to investigate the possibility of arranging for the selection of a girl child in Northern Cyprus, another state where it is legal.After further questioning, however, she and fiance Michael settled on America, where they felt the overall safeguards would be stronger.The couple will marry next year, and she will travel to California.    Danielle Lloyd, pictured with sons (from left) Harry, Ronnie, George and Archie, had three children with former Spurs player Jamie O\u0027Hara and one with electrician Michael O’NeillOnce there, a number of her eggs will be harvested and fertilised, and then one or two of the resulting female embryos will be reimplanted in the mother’s womb. The rest will be stored for possible use in the future.It will cost her about £12,000 plus flights and accommodation – and that’s just for one round.But to Danielle, getting the little girl that she craves is worth every penny.‘There’s an urge inside me to have a girl. I just can’t let it go,’ she explains.‘I’ve got such an amazing relationship with my mum. I want to have that bond with my daughter. Why would anyone begrudge me that?‘I also want my boys to have that brother-sister relationship. Our family is not yet complete.‘Michael feels the same way. He really wants a girl. If I had four girls, we’d be going off and getting a boy.‘Realistically, if I’m going to have one more, if this science is there, why not do it? I don’t think it’s a selfish thing to do. I could be selfish and go on for years having more and more boys.‘I’ve got four lovely boys but I don’t want to get to 50 or 60 and think I could have had a girl but didn’t,’ she adds.‘The thought of not going to my daughter’s wedding or not having those chats I have with my mum. Girls always have that relationship with their mothers.’Her television profile does, she admits, make her a lightning rod for criticism, particularly from those who assume she is not merely comfortably off, but rich. ‘People say, “I bet she’s got ten nannies”.          Danielle Lloyd (pictured at home) will go to America for the gender selection procedure, which has been condemned by the World Health Organisation (WHO)‘It really gets my back up. Actually, no. And, before Michael came along, I did it as a single mother.’She claims to understand her critics’ point of view, yet remains defiantly convinced she has the right to press ahead.‘When I mentioned it on television, people phoned in and said that if they did what I was doing in China, where they can have only one child, the population would be just boys,’ she says.‘They told me stories about baby girls being flushed down the toilet. It makes me feel like crying, but I’m nothing to do with that sort of world.‘If I was sitting here with no kids and saying I’m doing gender selection because I only want a girl and not a boy, then of course I’d expect criticism.‘But I’m not.‘I realise people have strong opinions. But I still don’t understand how anyone can call me a disgrace because I want a little girl as well as my boys. I genuinely don’t get what the big deal is.‘If we were having this debate in America, the attitude would be completely different because gender selection is perfectly legal and respectable there. It’s like IVF. They get the egg, artificially inseminate it and then check if the embryo is a girl or a boy.‘They give you the option of inserting one or two embryos. It might not work with one, so you’d have to pay again.‘Obviously there are women who can’t have children and I can totally understand that. To some of them, what I’m going to do makes me a terrible person.‘But at the same time, a lot of women have asked me to let them know where I’m going for the procedure, because they’d love to go there too.‘Women who had already been through it got in touch to pass on their advice.’Her sons, too, are right behind her, she says.‘They ask me every day “Mummy, have you got a baby sister in your tummy yet?” When it comes to birthdays and Christmases, they ask for a sister,’ says Danielle.‘I can see why some people think it’s wrong and selfish. Why don’t you just appreciate the children you’ve got? And, so on.‘But I really do appreciate them. I live for my children and love being a mum it’s what I was made to do.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/18/01/4F2C2EA600000578-0-image-m-6_1534552659529.jpg","title":"Girl 19 model Downs syndrome win international beauty pageant","story":"    Kate Grant, 19, from Northern Ireland, is the first model with Down\u0027s Syndrome to win an international beauty pageantA teenager has defied doctors who \u0027painted a bleak future\u0027 and said she would never learn to read or speak, by becoming the first model with Down\u0027s Syndrome to win an international beauty pageant.Kate Grant, 19, took the top prize in the Teen Ultimate Beauty Of The World competition, held in Portadown, Northern Ireland, which celebrates ersity.The event has three categories for children, teenagers and over-20s and is open to anyone regardless of weight, height or marital status.It also supports the Make-A-Wish Foundation, a charity that helps fulfill wishes to children with life-threatening conditions.Forty candidates from around the world took part in the pageant, with Kate representing her native northern Ireland. After an interview with a panel of judges, Kate took to the catwalk in a number of themed-outfits, including jeans and white T-shirt for the casual look, a black and white cocktail dress for the formal round and a sparkling, turquoise sequinned dress for the Time to Shine category.   Cross-your-legs-rail!

Truth isn\u0027t truth.\u0027The former New York City mayor went on to clarify he meant \u0027truth isn\u0027t truth\u0027 when two witnesses give conflicting reports in an investigation. He cited former FBI director James Comey\u0027s  claim that Trump talked to him about his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who was being investigated as part of the Russia probe.Originally the president\u0027s team said Trump did not ask Comey to drop its look at Flynn and the Russia investigation when the two men met in February 2017. But Giuliani said last week the two men did not discuss Flynn at all. Comey, who was then FBI director, claims Trump said to him: \u0027I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\u0027But Giuliani said on CNN last week: \u0027There was no conversation about Michael Flynn.\u0027 Flynn, who was Trump\u0027s first national security adviser, pled guilty in December to lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador and is cooperating with Mueller\u0027s investigation.

Comey says you did talk about it. So tell me what the truth is. If you\u0027re such a genius.\u0027Todd then brought up White House counsel Don McGahn, who the New York Times reported is talking to Mueller\u0027s team: \u0027Don McGahn might know.\u0027 \u0027Don McGahn doesn\u0027t know,\u0027 Giuliani said. The former mayor went on: \u0027So we have two pieces of evidence: Trump says he didn\u0027t tell him. The other guy says that he did say it. So which is the truth?\u0027Todd conceded Giuliani had a point. \u0027Alright on that point you\u0027re right, on two people,\u0027 he said.          Giuliani clarified he was talking about the conflicting reports witnesses give on an incident during an investigation          Giuliani also talked about the infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting attended by Donald Trump Jr.Negotiations have been ongoing between Trump\u0027s legal team and the special counsel\u0027s team on whether the president will sit down with them.Giuliani was also asked about the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, where Donald Trump Jr., Trump\u0027s son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign manager Paul Manafort meet with a Russian lawyer who had ties to the Kremlin.He doubled down on Trump\u0027s assertion the meeting - which took place during the heart of the presidential campaign - was to get information on Hillary Clinton.\u0027Because the meeting was originally for the purpose of getting information about Clinton\u0027 he said. \u0027That was the original intention of the meeting. It turned out to be a meeting about another subject and it was not pursued at all,\u0027 he added. \u0027And, of course, any meeting with regards to getting information on your opponent is something any candidate\u0027s staff would take. If someone said, I have information about your opponent, you would take that meeting.\u0027He also said the Trump campaign team didn\u0027t know they were meeting with a Russian and that the attorney, Natalia Veselnitskaya, did not represent the Kremlin.\u0027She didn\u0027t represent the Russian government. She was a private citizen. I don\u0027t even know if they knew she was Russian at the time. All they had were her name,\u0027 Giuliani said. \u0027They knew it when they met with her. Not when they set up the meeting.\u0027He added: \u0027All they knew was a woman with a Russian name wanted to meet with them.\u0027However, Donald Trump Jr. posted the emails about the meeting on his Twitter account.The emails were sent to Trump Jr via Rob Goldstone, a music publicist who represented Emin Agalarov, whose father, Aras Agalarov, is a major real estate developer close to Putin and who bought rights to the 2013 Miss Universe pageant that took place in Moscow and which Trump attended.One of the messages notes the meeting is with a \u0027Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow.\u0027 Explanations for the Trump Tower meeting, which has become a focal point of  Mueller\u0027s investigation into Russia\u0027s role in the 2016 election, have varied and a tweet from the president in early August added yet another one when he wrote the meeting was about Clinton.But the original statement from Donald Trump Jr about the meeting - which President Trump helped craft - said it was about Russian adoptions.  Donald Trump Jr. gave the New York Times a statement in July 2017, when the paper broke the story, that said the gathering was about an adoption program. His statement did not address whether the presidential campaign was discussed.The Russian lawyer at the meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, has led a multipronged attack against the Magnitsky Act, an American law that blacklists suspected Russian human rights abusers and championed by financier Bill Browder, who Russian President Vladimir Putin named during the Helsinki press conference as someone Russians want to speak to in exchange for letting Mueller talk to Russian nationals.The Magnitsky Act so enraged Putin he retaliated by halting American adoptions of Russian children."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/19/16/4F3685A100000578-6075931-image-a-39_1534691046614.jpg","title":"London cyclist lost leg notorious roundabout calls curbs huge lorries cities","story":"    Sarah Doone, 38, lost a leg after she was dragged under the front wheels of a cement lorry on Old Street roundabout in central London last month      Doctor to the Queen is named as cyclist killed after being...Male cyclist in his 60s dies after being hit by lorry on...Share this article    The notorious roundabout where Ms Doone was injured, pictured, was due to be made safer in early 2016, but work was delayed and now will not start until 2020Cycling UK\u0027s Duncan Dollimore has said that schemes to improve cycling safety are \u0027all too frequently\u0027 being delayed or cancelled, \u0027sometimes with tragic results\u0027.In 2016, 102 cyclists were killed on Britain\u0027s roads, a two per cent increase on the year before. Earlier this week Dr Peter Fisher, a doctor for the Queen, was killed after being hit by a lorry on his morning commute.

And in maths, 7.1 per cent got an A* in 2016 and 10.3 per cent got 8 or 9 in 2017.Professor Smithers said: \u0027Essentially the A* has been split into two and we are probably getting people achieving an 8 who under the old system would have got an A. They\u0027ve created more room at the top.\u0027It means now we are getting more grades equivalent to the old A* than before. It\u0027s very odd. More people seem to be getting these grades than I was expecting.\u0027 Exam regulator Ofqual has said it is not helpful to compare A* with 8 and 9 because they are not directly equivalent.It says the old A and A* have been replaced by three grades – 7, 8 and 9. According to Ofqual, the bottom of an A is the same as the bottom of a 7, and the bottom of a C is the same as the bottom of a 4 – but no other comparisons can be made.Professor Smithers\u0027 wide-ranging report also predicts as few as 200 students could get a clean sweep of 9 grades across eight subjects. Oxford and Cambridge take GCSEs as well as A level results into account along with a whole range of other extra-curricular activities and interests when assessing applicants.          Old alphabetical grades of A*-G were replaced by numerical ones from 9-1 last year in maths and English language and literatureIt comes amid a row over the new exam grades after Ofqual predicted the same proportion – a fifth – will get top grades as under the old system.Grade boundaries have been set lower to account for the fact that the new exams are tougher. The reforms are aimed at raising standards, but critics have questioned the point if the proportions of top results are coming out the same.An Ofqual spokesman said: \u0027GCSEs have been reformed to better prepare students for A levels or employment, with more challenging content and a different approach to assessment.\u0027It is not possible to make direct comparisons, although there are anchor points in the new grading system at 7 (A), 4 (C) and 1 (G).\u0027A Department for Education spokesman added: \u0027Our new gold-standard GCSEs don\u0027t just raise academic standards but the new grade 9 provides stretch at the top end of the ability range to recognise and reward truly exceptional performance.\u0027Last week A-level results showed the highest proportion of entries graded A or A* for six years, despite an overhaul designed to make the exams more rigorous."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/19/23/4F385B9200000578-0-image-m-16_1534716693023.jpg","title":"Top 10 jokes years Edinburgh Festival Fringe revealed","story":"    The Jobcentre is not the most likely place to provide inspiration for a stand-up comic, but a joke about the irony of being fired from one has been named the funniest of this year’s Edinburgh Festival FringeThe top ten jokes at Edinburgh were:1. ‘Working at the Jobcentre has to be a tense job – knowing that if you get fired, you still have to come in the next day’ – Adam Rowe2. ‘I had a job drilling holes for water – it was well boring’ – Leo Kearse3. ‘I took out a loan to pay for an exorcism.

Truth isn\u0027t truth.\u0027The former New York City mayor went on to clarify he meant \u0027truth isn\u0027t truth\u0027 when two witnesses give conflicting reports in an investigation. He cited former FBI director James Comey\u0027s  claim that Trump talked to him about his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who was being investigated as part of the Russia probe.Originally the president\u0027s team said Trump did not ask Comey to drop its look at Flynn and the Russia investigation when the two men met in February 2017. But Giuliani said last week the two men did not discuss Flynn at all. Comey, who was then FBI director, claims Trump said to him: \u0027I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\u0027But Giuliani said on CNN last week: \u0027There was no conversation about Michael Flynn.\u0027 Flynn, who was Trump\u0027s first national security adviser, pled guilty in December to lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador and is cooperating with Mueller\u0027s investigation. He resigned from the White House after 24 days when it was revealed he lied to Vice President Mike Pence about  conversations he had with Sergey Kislyak after the election.But Giuliani seemed to realize his \u0027truth isn\u0027t truth\u0027 statement could be misinterpreted, telling Todd \u0027Don\u0027t do this to me,\u0027 when the \u0027Meet the Press\u0027 host groaned, put his head in his hands, and pushed him on the issue.  Trump claims members of the press phoned to APOLOGIZE for...Trump says he \u0027allowed\u0027 White House attorney Donald McGahn...\u0027He will go down as easily the WORST in history\u0027: Trump...Share this articleTodd laughed, put his head in his hands and shook his head back and forth when Giuliani made his statement and said: \u0027Truth isn\u0027t truth? Mr. Mayor do you realize, this is going to become a bad meme.\u0027 Giuliani responded to his gesture with: \u0027Don\u0027t do this to me.\u0027\u0027Don\u0027t do truth isn\u0027t truth to me,\u0027 Todd shot back.Giuliani then went on to clarify: \u0027Donald Trump says I didn\u0027t talk about Flynn with Comey. Comey says you did talk about it. So tell me what the truth is. If you\u0027re such a genius.\u0027Todd then brought up White House counsel Don McGahn, who the New York Times reported is talking to Mueller\u0027s team: \u0027Don McGahn might know.\u0027 \u0027Don McGahn doesn\u0027t know,\u0027 Giuliani said. The former mayor went on: \u0027So we have two pieces of evidence: Trump says he didn\u0027t tell him. The other guy says that he did say it. So which is the truth?\u0027Todd conceded Giuliani had a point. \u0027Alright on that point you\u0027re right, on two people,\u0027 he said.          Giuliani clarified he was talking about the conflicting reports witnesses give on an incident during an investigation          Giuliani also talked about the infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting attended by Donald Trump Jr.Negotiations have been ongoing between Trump\u0027s legal team and the special counsel\u0027s team on whether the president will sit down with them.Giuliani was also asked about the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, where Donald Trump Jr., Trump\u0027s son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign manager Paul Manafort meet with a Russian lawyer who had ties to the Kremlin.He doubled down on Trump\u0027s assertion the meeting - which took place during the heart of the presidential campaign - was to get information on Hillary Clinton.\u0027Because the meeting was originally for the purpose of getting information about Clinton\u0027 he said. \u0027That was the original intention of the meeting. It turned out to be a meeting about another subject and it was not pursued at all,\u0027 he added. \u0027And, of course, any meeting with regards to getting information on your opponent is something any candidate\u0027s staff would take. If someone said, I have information about your opponent, you would take that meeting.\u0027He also said the Trump campaign team didn\u0027t know they were meeting with a Russian and that the attorney, Natalia Veselnitskaya, did not represent the Kremlin.\u0027She didn\u0027t represent the Russian government. She was a private citizen. I don\u0027t even know if they knew she was Russian at the time. All they had were her name,\u0027 Giuliani said. \u0027They knew it when they met with her. Not when they set up the meeting.\u0027He added: \u0027All they knew was a woman with a Russian name wanted to meet with them.\u0027However, Donald Trump Jr. posted the emails about the meeting on his Twitter account.The emails were sent to Trump Jr via Rob Goldstone, a music publicist who represented Emin Agalarov, whose father, Aras Agalarov, is a major real estate developer close to Putin and who bought rights to the 2013 Miss Universe pageant that took place in Moscow and which Trump attended.One of the messages notes the meeting is with a \u0027Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow.\u0027 Explanations for the Trump Tower meeting, which has become a focal point of  Mueller\u0027s investigation into Russia\u0027s role in the 2016 election, have varied and a tweet from the president in early August added yet another one when he wrote the meeting was about Clinton.But the original statement from Donald Trump Jr about the meeting - which President Trump helped craft - said it was about Russian adoptions.  Donald Trump Jr. gave the New York Times a statement in July 2017, when the paper broke the story, that said the gathering was about an adoption program. His statement did not address whether the presidential campaign was discussed.The Russian lawyer at the meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, has led a multipronged attack against the Magnitsky Act, an American law that blacklists suspected Russian human rights abusers and championed by financier Bill Browder, who Russian President Vladimir Putin named during the Helsinki press conference as someone Russians want to speak to in exchange for letting Mueller talk to Russian nationals.The Magnitsky Act so enraged Putin he retaliated by halting American adoptions of Russian children."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/19/15/4F3607B500000578-0-image-a-130_1534689563300.jpg","title":"Steam engines showcasing Britains industrial past shown 200 000 visitors","story":"    A Burrell Showman\u0027s Road Locomotive tows a Land Rover as dozens of steam powered vehicles make their way through Dorset to the Great Dorset Steam Fair that starts on Thursday and runs over the bank holiday weekend          Some steam enthusiasts stop to take a break and compare engines.

Professor Alan Smithers, of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: \u0027We have courses that are more demanding and exams that are more searching. And yet the results could be said to be coming out better.\u0027The academic claims 8 and 9 are being viewed as the equivalent of the old A*. Top universities including Oxford and Cambridge are also thought to see the grades as a way of distinguishing the top applicants.          Professor Smithers said that on average across all subjects taken in the first year of the new regime, about two-thirds more got a grade 8 or an 9 than were awarded an A* the year before. He added: \u0027Parents, pupils and schools have increasingly come to see straight A*s as the acme of achievement in GCSE. Although it does not sound like it a grade 8 is, in fact, the equivalent of an A*.\u0027And, counter-intuitively, in tougher exams these are going to increase if the three reformed GCSEs in 2017 are any guide to what will happen with the 20 new GCSEs this year.\u0027His research found that in English literature, 5 per cent of entries got A* in 2016 while 9.5 per cent got 8 or 9 in 2017 – almost double.Markers grading this year\u0027s GCSE and A-Level exams will be...Now for a Stormzy scholarship!

And in maths, 7.1 per cent got an A* in 2016 and 10.3 per cent got 8 or 9 in 2017.Professor Smithers said: \u0027Essentially the A* has been split into two and we are probably getting people achieving an 8 who under the old system would have got an A. They\u0027ve created more room at the top.\u0027It means now we are getting more grades equivalent to the old A* than before. It\u0027s very odd. More people seem to be getting these grades than I was expecting.\u0027 Exam regulator Ofqual has said it is not helpful to compare A* with 8 and 9 because they are not directly equivalent.It says the old A and A* have been replaced by three grades – 7, 8 and 9. According to Ofqual, the bottom of an A is the same as the bottom of a 7, and the bottom of a C is the same as the bottom of a 4 – but no other comparisons can be made.Professor Smithers\u0027 wide-ranging report also predicts as few as 200 students could get a clean sweep of 9 grades across eight subjects. Oxford and Cambridge take GCSEs as well as A level results into account along with a whole range of other extra-curricular activities and interests when assessing applicants.          Old alphabetical grades of A*-G were replaced by numerical ones from 9-1 last year in maths and English language and literatureIt comes amid a row over the new exam grades after Ofqual predicted the same proportion – a fifth – will get top grades as under the old system.Grade boundaries have been set lower to account for the fact that the new exams are tougher. The reforms are aimed at raising standards, but critics have questioned the point if the proportions of top results are coming out the same.An Ofqual spokesman said: \u0027GCSEs have been reformed to better prepare students for A levels or employment, with more challenging content and a different approach to assessment.\u0027It is not possible to make direct comparisons, although there are anchor points in the new grading system at 7 (A), 4 (C) and 1 (G).\u0027A Department for Education spokesman added: \u0027Our new gold-standard GCSEs don\u0027t just raise academic standards but the new grade 9 provides stretch at the top end of the ability range to recognise and reward truly exceptional performance.\u0027Last week A-level results showed the highest proportion of entries graded A or A* for six years, despite an overhaul designed to make the exams more rigorous."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/19/23/4F385B9200000578-0-image-m-16_1534716693023.jpg","title":"Top 10 jokes years Edinburgh Festival Fringe revealed","story":"    The Jobcentre is not the most likely place to provide inspiration for a stand-up comic, but a joke about the irony of being fired from one has been named the funniest of this year’s Edinburgh Festival FringeThe top ten jokes at Edinburgh were:1. ‘Working at the Jobcentre has to be a tense job – knowing that if you get fired, you still have to come in the next day’ – Adam Rowe2. ‘I had a job drilling holes for water – it was well boring’ – Leo Kearse3. ‘I took out a loan to pay for an exorcism.

Also, it is a colour that suffers from social stigma and cliches, so it’s fun to work with that and go against the grain of the prejudice.” Pancrazi now lives in Oxford, and his photographic series began with a desire to revisit the Mediterranean city where he grew up. “It started as an aestheticisation of my home town and the memories I had there,” he explains. “Living abroad, in a fairly different climate, prompted me to find the reality that was hidden beyond those ethereal memories.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4a443eebdac317b303d4f03e028dbefa403fc4c/226_538_3333_2000/master/3333.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e91273f830e4daaa3e6b160d9b8b47d7","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"The death of Aretha Franklin, the bridge collapse in Genoa and a scrambling turtle – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c004ebb5b31a367a9be9be2212dd0315968f1734/0_143_8688_5212/master/8688.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b53a6419cd2ce6d70106a71474ff3512","title":"jewels in the night sea exhibition in pictures","story":"Ryo Minemizu, one of Japan’s emerging stars in the field of marine life photography and the 2017 winner of the Nikkei National Geographic photography prize, captures the beauty and complexity of plankton that drift in our planet’s oceans and other bodies of water in meticulous detail"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1734dd0eb9833fb2f45f8524f5e7a904f5f63a22/0_195_5568_3342/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df4c8932bf5db08d00d6c9304bba1b21","title":"australian pm dumps key climate policy to stave off leadership revolt","story":"Malcolm Turnbull gives in to conservative members of his party who demanded he axe carbon emission reduction targetsAustralia’s prime minister has abandoned plans to rein in greenhouse gas emissions in an attempt to stave off a leadership coup from within his own party.But the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was forced into an embarrassing backdown on Monday after opposition within his Coalition government and amid mounting speculation that he could face a leadership challenge.A group of conservative MPs threatened to vote against the legislation on the floor of Australia’s lower house, a move that would have constituted a crisis of confidence in Turnbull’s leadership.The rebel MPs were led by Australia’s former prime minister, Tony Abbott, who Turnbull seized the leadership from in 2015. The pair have a history of bitter disagreement over emissions policy.Abbott, who signed Australia up to the Paris climate agreement in 2014, said using energy policy to reduce emissions was “madness”.“I am just interested in trying to ensure that Australians have the lowest possible power prices and that people’s jobs are safe ... what that means is that we stop running a power system to reduce emissions,” he said.To placate the dissenters, Turnbull late last week moved to strip the emissions reduction target from the legislation.That did little to assuage the concerns of Turnbull’s internal opponents. Government MPs began sounding out conservative figurehead, Peter Dutton, the home affairs minister, for a possible leadership challenge. Abbott reportedly said he would give his support to Dutton.The Coalition held an emergency meeting on Sunday night to discuss the energy policy, and a poll published at roughly the same time showed a significant in decrease in support for the government, piling more pressure on Turnbull.On Monday, Turnbull capitulated and announced he would not include any emissions reduction target in his National Energy Guarantee policy. He said it was clear the government, which holds only a single-seat majority in the lower house, did not have the numbers.“Now in politics you have to focus on what you can deliver and that’s what we’ve done and will continue to do,” Turnbull said on Monday. Turnbull said he had “absolute support” of his party and Dutton.The decisions earned him the praise of maverick Coalition MPs. One conservative, George Christensen, a Queensland senator, said of Turnbull’s decision: “We have a new energy policy thanks to a band of ‘Liberal National rebels’ who stood firm and fought for common sense.”The debate comes as Australia deals with unusually early bushfires in the state of New South Wales. Environmental scientists have described the winter fires as “mind-bending”, and “unusual in the extreme”, and say climate change is extending the normal bushfire season.Successive Australian governments have struggled to implement climate and energy policies. Attempts to legislate mechanisms to reduce emissions have done enormous damage to former Labor prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard.Rudd faced a sustained and highly effective campaign over plans to introduce an emissions trading scheme in the late 2000s, and Gillard’s carbon pricing mechanism was attacked relentlessly in the lead-up to the 2013 election, which Labor lost.The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, seized on Turnbull’s backdown on Monday and described him as the “white flag prime minister”. “Mr Turnbull has demonstrated that he is not the leader this nation needs,” Shorten said.“Real leadership is about fighting for the principles you believe in. Real leadership is about not always giving in to your enemies every time they disagree with you..”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95fa57b97c1a3a48b332ffb3f8e344da5340f63c/553_126_2947_1768/master/2947.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56fce4abd9ec8fce9caabb06f9e6c45b","title":"british manufacturing output slips to ninth globally behind france","story":"Data shows sector starved of investment and losing ground as Brexit uncertainty persistsBritain’s manufacturing industry has fallen to ninth in the world behind France, reversing a recovery in its performance since the financial crash.The UK’s total manufacturing output stayed ahead of Brazil and Indonesia but slipped below France and remained well adrift of Germany in fourth position and Italy in seventh at the end of 2016. The figures show a troubling decline in the UK’s international standing after the Brexit vote and emphasises the uphill task of regaining its position of seventh achieved in 2007.China kept the top spot ahead of the US and Japan while South Korea and India were fifth and sixth respectively.Recent data shows the UK’s manufacturing sector being starved of investment funds and losing momentum as uncertainty persists surrounding the the UK’s relationship with the EU from next year.A report in June found that the sector had lost 600,000 jobs in the past 10 years to leave it employing fewer than 3 million workers.The EEF, the manufacturer’s trade body that published the figures, said the sector “punched above its weight” and was of vital importance to the UK’s economic health. It said workers’ average pay was higher than the national average and that productivity growth remained strong.A study showed that jobs in the sector paid an average of £32,500, above the national average estimated by the ONS at £27,271, rising to almost £40,000 for a skilled post in a car factory.  “Our latest data continue to show that UK manufacturing punches above its weight in some vital areas of the economy and contributes more than the sum of its parts. This is reflected regionally, in productivity and pay levels, for millions of people working in the sector,” he said.“It provides an important reminder that we’re still one of the top 10 biggest manufacturing nations and we want to see policy makers working with industry to help move UK manufacturing up the rankings.” The car industry offered the highest average pay at £39,800, beating the chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries into second place with an average salary of £39,500. The food and drink industry was the worst for pay, offering an average salary of just £27,600.Productivity, which measures the amount produced by each worker per hour, is seen as a crucial measure of an industry’s success and its ability to increase workers’ wages."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71d21c477e7be9e0271d5631c5340873f2039d14/0_1428_8558_5134/master/8558.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cd00acedc28ceddf96f785671e072d0","title":"mulberry house of fraser profits","story":"Luxury bag firm, which operates 21 concessions in chain’s stores, expects £3m hitLuxury handbag maker Mulberry has warned that it faces a slump in profits after suffering a £3m hit from House of Fraser’s collapse into administration.Mulberry, which has already reported struggling sales as wealthy tourists favour Paris and Milan over London, operates 21 concessions in House of Fraser, employing 88 staff.Mulberry said the collapse of the department stores group would cost it £3m in the six months to 30 September.

What was true of the summer of love generation applies also to Berlin’s 1990s techno scene, the subject of the city’s latest blockbuster exhibition.The brainchild of the team behind Berlin’s nostalgia-drenched DDR Museum, Nineties Berlin promises thrill-seeking tourists a taste of the fabled parties of the 20th century’s last decade.Visitors begin their interactive experience with a 16-minute film to set the scene. It’s 1990. The Berlin Wall has fallen, the east German state has melted away and many east Berliners who have left to seek new opportunity in the west.New arrivals flood the empty spaces, bringing with them a radical new sound: techno. Before long, hordes of party people have conquered the abandoned warehouses and factories. Music, art and dance blossom in the ruins of the disappearing state. Things get personal in the exhibition’s next room, where 13 talking heads jabber all at once from a circle of inward-facing video screens. Musicians tell of unemployment benefits that gave them endless time to experiment, while squatters and hooligans explain how they exploited the chaos for their own gain.Winding past a life-sized mockup of the Berlin Wall, visitors then enter a labyrinth dotted with shrines to lost venues designed by former residents of the artist squat Tacheles, which closed in 2012. Finally, in a mirrored DJ booth, they learn how the Love Parade grew from a humble street party in 1989 into a 1.5 million-strong mega-rave a decade later.The exhibition samples a list of Love Parade anthems from artists such as Emmanuel Top, Westbam, Felix, D-Shake, Kernkraft, Underworld and Faithless.Exhibitions like this are all good fun, says Tobias Rapp, author of the 2009 book Lost and Sound: Berlin, Techno und der Easyjetset, but no one should mistake them for serious history.“Pop culture has always needed to glorify the past,” says Rapp, who himself moved into an east Berlin squat in 1990 and lived through the city’s techno heyday as a student raver. “It’s always better where you aren’t. Of course, that’s largely rubbish. This 90s nostalgia has a lot of blind spots. East Berlin back then wasn’t some kind of subcultural paradise. We had to fight.”He means that literally. Back then, groups of neo-Nazis roamed dimly lit streets looking for a scrap, remembers Rachel Clarke. The Scottish performer moved into an east Berlin squat in the summer of 1991 and has called the city home ever since. Gangs routinely attacked those who looked or sounded foreign, she says.Neo-Nazis weren’t the only issue, says Clarke, who endured freezing winters in unrenovated buildings with bad plumbing and dangerous wiring. “It was horrific really, in some ways,” she says.And, of course, not everyone was into techno. For many east Berliners struggling to adjust to new realities, the influx of partygoers from the west was a source of bemusement.Anja Kahlau grew up in the east Berlin district of Prenzlauer Berg. She had just turned 18 when the wall fell in 1989 and moved out of her family home into a squatted housing project. Before long, a techno club sprang up next door.“We often didn’t get any sleep,” remembers Kahlau. “Techno wasn’t really my thing. We threw parties of course, but they weren’t as excessive.”Much more than the three-day-long raves, those who lived through the real 1990s Berlin say it’s the empty space they miss most.“We felt freer because there was more space,” says Clarke, who remembers holding kids’ film workshops on urban wastelands that have since been blanketed with blocks of high-rise flats. “The space didn’t have a price on it, it belonged to everybody.”Now, she says, the premium on living space has made Berliners more uptight. But Clarke, who remains active in the city’s vibrant theatre and arts scene, doesn’t think the story’s over. She’s learned to look beyond skyrocketing rents and the flood of designer boutiques, hipster coffee shops and foodie street markets.“Look to the spaces in between,” says Clarke. “You’ll still find niches in Berlin where a lot of people are able to fulfil their dreams.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03bd9ac969cdd705e389df8a7cb7e9f4c976382c/0_106_2410_1446/master/2410.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c44b49685bc7c228511e1c73987e29a1","title":"the guardian view on china unease at home and abroad","story":"This has not been the easiest of summers for Xi Jinping and his country. Donald Trump’s tariffs have rattled nerves in Beijing, already unsettled by the slowing economy. The ministry of finance and the central bank have\u0026nbsphad an open spat over fiscal policy. There are grumblings that the leadership invited trouble with its unabashed projection of might was too complacent about the risks of US trade action and is struggling to respond. But even if trade talks make progress when they resume this week, the issue is a channel for frustrations as well as the proximate cause.Underlying the tariffs is the growing hostility to China across the American political class. Beijing is correct to detect Washington’s anxiety in the face of its economic, technological and military progress. But the strength and breadth of concern is prompted by China’s increasingly repressive turn at home, and forcefulness abroad. Mr Trump’s erraticism, bullying and ignorance and the US disengagement he pursues have given Beijing a unique opportunity to make friends and influence people. Yet Australia, so dependent on China economically, has sounded the alert about “sharp power” and covert influence operations. Last month, Germany effectively blocked China’s state grid from taking a majority stake in an electricity network, citing national security concerns.In Singapore, there are increasingly obvious nerves about China’s influence. Malaysia has suspended $23bn in Beijing-backed infrastructure projects. Thailand has announced the launch of a regional infrastructure fund, seen as an attempt to reduce reliance on Chinese investment. Countries are taking a hard look at their relationship with Beijing, and the true cost of attractive deals. The ambitious rhetoric has backfired – but even if it is scaled down, what really worries people are deeds not words. These range from established issues such as hacking and trade practices to the militarisation of the South China Sea and Sri Lanka’s debt-necessitated 99-year lease of Hambantota port to the Chinese state-owned corporation which built it.The claim that the world, or at least the west, “got China wrong” is not quite right more accurately, governments and businesses were often too hungry to do their due diligence, or to act upon the warnings they did receive. In any case, in the age of Mr Trump, climate change and a globalised economy, working with China is not a choice, but a necessity. This trade war is not a solution to the problems. What is needed is not more hostility, but more attention: a serious investment (not least linguistic) in truly understanding what China seeks and how it tries to achieve it. It means more nuance and sophistication, not less. It means recognising that it is normal for rising powers to seek to reshape rules, but determining what concrete problems this poses in light of its priorities and values – and how to address them. It means, for instance, closely examining Beijing’s systematic efforts to enlist the Chinese diaspora in its foreign influence work, without overreacting to public diplomacy, or scapegoating or\u0026nbspstereotyping communities.It means, too, consistency: not least a real commitment to working with those who share similar values instead of selling each other out for short-term advantage. Needless to say this will be a particular challenge for Britain in the age of Brexit. It means understanding that rights and values are not a bolt-on or a luxury for better times, but must be fundamental to the relationship. It means bolstering institutions that defend them, and upholding standards through our behaviour as well as our statements. None of this\u0026nbspis easy. But it is necessary when the alternatives are drift and wishful thinking on one hand, or kneejerk hawkishness on the other."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b58c36fde559af72679831af7382fd916404f8a8/0_0_5124_3073/master/5124.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfde3fbe0c8403a899a425dca3005c83","title":"vienna lagos economist intelligence unit liveability index","story":"The Economist Intelligence Unit’s index claims Vienna is more cultured than Lagos. But it is flawed and subjectiveA few months ago, I stepped out one morning and saw a coil of animal poo on the doorstep. My mother and I spent a long time trying to figure out what sort of animal had done the deed. We decided, in the end, that a fox was the culprit. But it could also have been a racist. The incident has occurred twice but as we’ve got rid of the evidence both times, we’ll never know.I am not the only one who has had a similar experience in London. Just search “poo on doorstep”. It occurs frequently enough to have generated several threads on the internet. Yet, when ranking the world’s best cities to live in last week, the mighty statisticians of the Economist Intelligence Unit didn’t take into account “likeliness to find a turd on your front doorstep”. In the 14 years I lived in Lagos, I never once found faeces in front of my house. Yet Lagos is judged one of the 10 least liveable cities in the world, and London comes much higher in the desirability rankings, at number 48.Granted, I have no problems with some of the things the index does track, such as crime rates, the efficiency of transportation networks, and quality of healthcare. All are important, and improve one’s experience of a city. Lagos scored low in all these categories and as a Lagosian, I readily admit that we can do better in all these areas.But I’d certainly question how cities were ranked in some of the other areas that make up the index. In the culture and environment category, which includes recreational activities, Vienna scored 96.3 out of 100 and Lagos just 53.5. Now I’ve been to Vienna, and I’ve lived in Lagos, and there is no way Vienna is 43 points ahead of Lagos in culture and environment.Just ask Emmanuel Macron, who recently made a pilgrimage to Fela Kuti’s New Afrika Shrine in Lagos. Lagos is a city of galleries under bridges, where artists paint and display for free. It’s a city of owambe parties that last until dawn. Every weekend there is a royal wedding that shuts down roads and stops traffic. Lagos is a city of fashion, home to the third biggest film industry in the world, and its Afrobeat music pulses out to reach the ears of a global audience. It’s obvious the statisticians didn’t\u0026nbspknow\u0026nbspwhere to look.What does it mean to rank the culture of one place above the other? To say Douala in Cameroon comes lower than Dakar in Senegal in culture but higher than Dhaka in Bangladesh? What ingrained biases went into calculating these scores? Culture doesn’t only live in a museum, in an opera house or in a Picasso painting. African artists, by the way, inspired Picasso.And let’s talk about the things that were not measured. The report observed: “Those that score best tend to be midsized cities in wealthier countries.” Perhaps because they mostly picked metrics these cities would score highly on. How lonely are the people who live in the wealthier capitals of the world? How high are the levels of anxiety in these cities? How likely are strangers to come to your aid if you are in distress?My car has broken down several times in Lagos. Strangers have always arrived, bearing tyre pumps, offering to push-start or fetch a nearby mechanic. In London, friends who have broken down report vehicles whizzing merrily past. No one stopped, not even when it was raining. And why should they? The infrastructure is so great. Some emergency breakdown company would get to them eventually. The city is so efficient that there’s no need to get personally involved in helping\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspstranger.Why do studies like this exist anyway? The people who actually live in Harare, Karachi and Algiers are still living there, no matter how “unliveable” the Economist Intelligence Unit judges their cities. In the report summary, the compilers state that their findings will help in “assigning a hardship allowance as part of expatriate relocation packages”. I’d just like to say that Lagos has enough expats. We see them, overpaid and overfed, establishing little colonies, disparaging the local culture, food and customs, and earning three times what they would at home. There are qualified Nigerians who know the terrain and can do their work just as well or even better.Yes, there can be hardship living in Lagos but there are also joys, highs, thrills and jollof rice. So whether you judge Lagos liveable or not, Lagosians will go on living and thriving there. To paraphrase Benjamin Disraeli, there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and global liveability indexes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44a0e0b0a4d04d192fa1d98feb8c177e1429f861/1651_472_3619_2172/master/3619.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e5c444f40332e9f3a0d33485ac34746","title":"jeremy corbyn labour eu social democracy","story":"While New Labour dragged Europe to the right, Corbyn could champion an anti-austerity vision for the whole of EuropeLong before the EU started to evolve into its current incarnation, there was a different vision of a united Europe. In 1941 a group of socialist and communist anti-fascists were imprisoned by Mussolini on the island of Ventotene. Led by Altiero Spinelli, they produced the Ventotene manifesto, a strategy for a united socialist Europe as “the only way out of their common predicament of domination by Hitler”.Today a new “common predicament” – austerity and corporate-driven markets – means this socialist European tradition must be revived in a modern, pluralist form. It is needed to counter the decline of social democratic parties across Europe, where only the Portuguese Socialists under António Costa and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour have bucked the trend.While Corbyn opposes the neoliberalism of the current EU, he has pledged to work for an “anti-austerity Europe”, most recently last month at the Durham Miners’ Gala. This is more than a rhetorical flourish: it is a signal that Corbyn is more pro-European than the press conveys, albeit not in the conventional way. His recent statements on Europe clarify that being in the EU does not necessarily prevent public intervention in industry, and highlight his commitment to European social regulation.So there’s a popular alternative to either a deregulatory, free-market Brexit or being part of a neoliberal EU: a new relationship between an anti-austerity Britain and an anti-austerity Europe. As a strong supporter of Corbyn, I urge him to work with the Portuguese and Spanish governments, as well as labour movements and left parties across the continent, to map out a collaborative strategy for a socialist Europe, both through membership of the EU and through strong support for labour and social movements across Europe.British governments have been at the forefront of turning the EU into an instrument of market politics, from opting out of key elements of Jacques Delors’ European social charter (attacked by Margaret Thatcher as “socialism by the back door”), to David Cameron’s veto of the financial transaction tax. The way forward for the left is not in “stopping” Brexit. Instead, it lies in working with allies across Europe, for example by supporting the new Social Democrat German finance minister, Olaf Scholz, in putting the transaction tax back on the table and backing measures to end the undercutting of wages and labour rights, by requiring companies employing migrant labour to respect the union and wage agreements of the host country. In the same way that New Labour once shifted European social democracy to the right, Corbyn’s Labour could shift it to the left.Labour has developed impressive national policies for publicly led economic development that would address the inequalities that underlie support for Brexit in the north of England. Why not extend these principles of public productivity on a European scale?Public ownership of the railways, for example, could enable Corbyn to champion an integrated, reasonably priced and publicly owned European railway system, providing an alternative to airport expansion and a way of taking freight off the roads. Other Europe-wide applications of Labour’s 2017 manifesto commitments could be developed by bringing together decentralised city-run public companies for renewable energy, and expanding the co-operative sector – both of which already have considerable support across Europe.An anti-austerity vision can provide a framework for a new relationship between the UK and Europe. Of course, a new relationship must address trade, but the question is what frames and drives trade policy: market competition, or meeting social needs, where market exchange is subordinated to a framework of public and co-operative ownership?The clash over EU membership has so far failed to produce a constructive debate. The two sides have simply shouted past each other. Instead, we should be aiming for a debate that generates the engagement with pan-European issues that has been long absent in Britain. Labour is uniquely placed to achieve this as its membership and voting base brings together people from both sides of the Brexit debate.This spirit of creative debate is already evident in the bottom-up processes that are feeding into Labour’s new economic policies. The first stage for developing a new relationship with Europe, after clearing away the debris of Theresa May’s broken Brexit plans, must involve argument and debate across the Labour party and Momentum, and its allies on the European left.A new politics, based on a belief in the extraordinary capacities of ordinary people, requires breaking from the presumption that the people can only say yea or nay to the proposals of the political class. Britain’s future relationship with Europe should be discussed in neighbourhood and town meetings across Britain. To build a Europe for the many – one that lives up to the Ventotene vision – the many must be actively involved in its creation.• Hilary Wainwright is co-editor of Red Pepper and research director of the New Politics Project of the Transnational Institute, Amsterdam"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e88204bb64fdb7d53b6733c8a218cd098255b95/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8a1455b20a97b2a64abfb3f5683ac736 1320w","title":"new gcses put pupils under more pressure say school leaders","story":"Students to receive results with grades 9-1 after changes initiated by Michael GoveThe tougher standards demanded by the new style of GCSEs being awarded for the first time this year have put pupils under a great deal of additional pressure, according to school leaders.Hundreds of thousands of pupils in England will receive their results this week, with grades from 9 to 1 replacing the familiar A* to G.Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the “bar has deliberately been set at a higher level” as a result of changes initiated by the former education secretary Michael Gove.“The new exams are harder, contain more content, and involve sitting more papers,” Barton said. “We are worried about the impact on the mental health and wellbeing of young people caused by these reforms and it is our view that such a substantial set of changes as this should have been introduced in a more managed and considered manner.“It is to the credit of schools that they have responded to this situation by providing their students with extensive pastoral support in order to alleviate stress and anxiety despite severe funding pressures.”Hailed as the most significant change in the examination system since O-levels were replaced 30 years ago, the “more demanding, more fulfilling and more stretching” exams were introduced to help the UK better compete internationally, Gove said in 2013.The fruits of that effort will be seen on Thursday when the results of 20 of the new GCSEs are published, including those in biology, history and Spanish.Gove’s changes stripped out assessed work that had accounted for a substantial proportion of marks towards the final grades. In chemistry and biology, for example, non-exam assessments accounted for a quarter of a candidate’s marks, but in the new GCSEs everything depends on the final exams.Ofqual, which regulates public examinations in England, has pledged to maintain continuity in the proportion of grades awarded. Cath Jadhav, the director of standards at Ofqual, said exam boards would use statistics to counteract any dip in results caused by teachers being less familiar with the content and pupils having less support material.“Across all subjects, grade boundaries will be set this summer to ensure that students this summer are treated fairly and are not disadvantaged by being the first to sit new GCSEs,” Jadhav wrote in a blogpost explaining the way grades would be set.According to Ofqual, the new grade 7 will start at the same standard as the former A grade, meaning 9, 8 and 7 grades replace the old A* and A. The 9 is equivalent to the top half of A* awards, while an 8 encompasses the bottom portion of A* and the top part of an A, making comparisons with the old grades difficult.“Grade 9 is not the same as the old A* grade. It’s a new grade designed to recognise the very best performance. So in every subject there will be fewer grade 9s awarded than A*s in the old GCSEs,” Jadhav said.Last year maths, English language and English literature were the first subjects to be examined under the new system. About 2,000 pupils gained 9s in all three subjects. As few as 200 pupils have been forecast to achieve a full set of 9s in eight or more subjects this year.“It was already very hard to achieve the top grade of A* under the old system, and it is even harder to achieve the top grade of a 9 under the new system,” Barton said. “Young people striving for those top grades may therefore feel disappointed if they do not achieve them, even though they have done exceptionally well in the grades they do achieve.”Because a number of courses, including economics and design and technology, will not offer the reformed exams until next summer, parents will be confronted with children holding a mixture of numbered and lettered grades.The previous C grade will be fixed to the same boundaries as the new grade 4, but both a 4 and a 5 will be regarded as a pass grade in the same way as a C, with the Department for Education describing a 5 as a “strong pass”.The new combined science GCSE will be awarded as a double grade, to reflect the greater amount of content being taught. As a result, candidates will be awarded double grades ranging from 9-9, 9-8 and so on, down to the lowest 1-1 grade.The changes do not affect Wales and Northern Ireland, which are retaining the old GCSE grades. Scottish students sit exams under a separate system."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05a1436dd45d8a40bde915ff947263a37805063c/0_804_4733_2841/master/4733.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd1d57f594e1df122e4ba0342a11caaf","title":"grand dishes grandmothers recipes stories","story":"Meet the stars of an award-winning project celebrating the lives and recipes of the true heroes of family cooking“She cooks like no one else I know,” says Anastasia Miari of her grandmother, whose name is also Anastasia Miari (her grandchildren call her Yiayia – the Greek for granny) and who lives by herself in a tiny house in Corfu. “She’s pretty ferocious, but she cooks the most phenomenal food over an open fire, aged 80, and really shows her love for me and the rest of my family through the dishes she puts on the table.”A couple of years ago, as she was trying to cajole recipes out of Yiayia, Miari, a 28-year-old journalist living in London, had a brainwave: “Wouldn’t it be cool to do a book of grandmothers’ recipes and stories?” She mentioned the idea to her university friend, Iska Lupton, a creative director whose relationship with her own grandmother is also bound up with food, and together they created Grand Dishes.The project began to take shape online, with excerpts from their interviews appearing on granddishes, 2018 winner of best blog at the Guild of Food Writers awards (the full versions will run in a book, currently crowdfunding at unbound). “The more people we spoke to about what we were doing,” says Miari, “the more people were like, ‘I’ve got a granny you need to interview.’”“Initially we’d think, oh, we’d better check if this one’s got a good story,” says Lupton. “Then we realised, anyone who’s lived beyond 70 has so many stories to tell. As long as they’ve got a recipe of their own to share, we just know the stories will come.”I grew up in Johannesburg and started a family there. Then, at 30, I said to my husband, “It’s time to go” – I knew that South Africa was not right for my children – so we packed everything up and started from scratch in London.Life was very busy in England. I worked with Revlon for 20 years, doing promotions all over the country, so cooking for a hungry family had to be fast. If I made a steak, I’d serve it with onions, tomato sauce and Worcestershire sauce, and call it a monkey gland steak. That was their favourite. I could make a very nice dinner within 10 minutes.Since I was a young girl I have watched what I eat, and I have, I think, the perfect body for my age. I see that I have a certain amount of protein, vegetables and fruit. I make a smoothie every day, with five or six different fruits. And I try not to snack, especially after dinner. I never weigh myself – I know by my clothes if I’m putting on weight – and my metabolism seems to have improved with age. I can eat more today than when I was a youngster.I’ve had three men in my life. Two of them could cook. My husband – we were married for 37 years – used to help from time to time. The next one was an Englishman and he was very English: he used to just sit at the table and wait to be served. The last one, an American, was a rocket scientist. We’ve been together 14 years. He’s 91 now and in a home. I still go over to visit, but mostly I’m on my own here in London. I’ll be 89 in a week’s time and I’m fit as a fiddle. I do have cancer: chronic leukaemia. But I just get on with my life. My grandchildren – I’ve got two in London and one in America – love to come around and eat at my place they’re mad about my chicken curry and rice. Food is important, it’s like fuel to a car, but we shouldn’t be obsessed about it. When my two boys were very young, they would ask me what we were going to have for dinner. I never said: “We’re going to have pasta.” I’d say: “We’re going to have food.” As long as I put food on the table, that’s the important thing, not the choice. We get so much, we should be happy with what we have. Why make it complicated? If you can’t eat fish today, eat chicken, or eat lentils.As a child in Germany, I used to watch my mother and grandmother cooking and eventually they allowed me to help. We would have typically Bavarian dishes, such as knödel, which is a sort of dumpling. They’re quite a lot of trouble to prepare: you have to grate raw potatoes and mix them with very liquid mashed potatoes, and having taken them all apart, you put them together again. I thought this was great fun.One day in 1938, when I was 10, my mother picked me up from school. She drove straight to the nearest airport, parked the car, left the key in it and then booked a flight, which we boarded that afternoon. I never learned exactly what sparked that decision but it saved our lives –my father was Jewish.In England, I was desperately keen to be completely English. When I went walking through town with my mum, I’d always try to stop her talking so noisily. She’d let the cat out of the bag, of course, and people would know we were foreign. We really weren’t welcome anywhere.When I started cooking for myself, as a student at the Royal College of Music, it was mostly English food. But I suppose it was more exciting to cook the old German recipes. My music studies were supposed to be taken all the way, but I married, and children came along, and there wasn’t time. These days I just adore a fried egg on spinach. My grandchildren love what they call my “granny carrots”. You chop your carrots into little diced things and cook them in butter with fried onions and maybe a few drops of lemon juice, then masses of parsley at the end. So they were very flavoursome.I don’t take much pleasure in cooking these days. I make a mess in the kitchen. Now I’m 90, that’s not really surprising, is it?In my time, we were told you had to go to your in-laws so you could learn how to cook. But my mother was a very good cook, so I learned everything from her first. Then I got married and my mother-in-law was a very good cook as well. So I learned from both ladies, and I’m still interested in cooking.We left Tanzania for England 45 years ago. My children and my husband settled very quickly but I didn’t settle for two years. I was all the time crying because I missed my family. But I got a very good job with Corah \u0026amp Sons, a Jewish company that made clothes for Marks \u0026amp Spencer. It was good pay, good people, everything good, so eventually I settled. We’ve been in Leicester 45 years and now it’s my home, I don’t want to go anywhere.Even when I was working, I had time to cook. My husband can do only beans on toast, but he helps a lot with housework. My children were very good eaters, I never had any problem. I like making savouries for them – I always make my own Bombay mix. Up till now at least: I don’t know in 12 months if I’ll be able to do it or not, because of my age.My daughter’s daughter and my son’s two daughters, they all love cooking, but their way is not my way. My way is completely old-style. They love my proper curries – lentil curry, a curry I make with yogurt. They really love my food. Sometimes they ring me and say: “Grandma, make this thing for us.”Food is a big chunk of my life. My husband had three children from his previous marriage and I had three with him, so I ended up with six children and I had to cater for all of them. Once or twice I had to say: “Come on, I don’t dish up poison, you eat what I give you.” Otherwise, they ate everything.My husband didn’t do any cooking, he was busy working. He went out early and I always had a meal waiting when he came in. I never resented it. I can hardly stop myself now – I’ve made coconut tartlets this morning. The children all had their little jobs: one cleared the table, one filled the dishwasher and one dried up. My husband didn’t help, but he was wonderful and loving. I had a very happy marriage.I still cook every day because I’ve got an arrangement with a widower, who comes to eat at six and goes at seven. I used to cook for a chap who worked for my husband, but he died suddenly, so I rang up John and said: “Pat’s gone, I’ll cook for you.” So he comes up, has a meal with me, and pays for it by taking me to the cinema. I did beef carbonnade two weeks ago and he’d never heard of it. But he eats it all. It’s like the dog’s licked the plate in the end.My dinners are not complete without a pudding. I do one every single day and try to vary them as much as possible. But I don’t have a very sweet tooth. I had a road accident many years ago and they put me on medication which I think affected my taste buds, as well as damaging my nervous system, because I’m not into the cakes like I used to be. I do everything myself – jams, chutneys – I don’t buy anything at all, never have done since my eldest child was born in 1968. I grow all my own vegetables as well, chemical-free. I’ve got a large greenhouse, and guess what I do, I still bottle my tomatoes. You use them as you would tinned tomatoes. I haven’t bought a loaf of bread in 50 years.When I was younger, I was more interested in making things – building and fixing – than cooking. But when my son Daniel was at university, I started a small coffee shop in Woolwich, south-east London. We were serving British things: jacket potato, coronation chicken, tuna mayo. When that didn’t work out, we decided as a family to change it to an Eritrean restaurant called Blue Nile.All the recipes were chosen by the family, based on food I cooked at home. The kitcha fit-fit (pitta bread fried in spiced butter and Eritrean spices served with yogurt) is Daniel’s favourite, I used to make it on a Sunday for breakfast. Habte, my husband, likes ful (warm broad bean stew served with a boiled egg). My favourite is hamli (spinach cooked with garlic, chilli and olive oil). It reminds me of Eritrea, where I grew up – my grandmother would make it if we came to visit.I never, ever cook from recipe books, I just cook. And I get pleasure from cooking – when I look at someone enjoying my food, that’s the best. My husband doesn’t do much in the kitchen, although he managed to cook bolognese sauce when I broke my leg. It impressed me very much, but afterwards he said: “Don’t push your luck.” He also makes scrambled eggs now and then – the boys call it Dad’s Famous Scrambled Egg – and that’s fine by me.Learning to cook happens day by day. You try something and think, um, this one doesn’t look or taste nice, so you adjust it. Also when the customers come, I always see whether they’re eating it or not. I ask them: “Is that OK? Do you want another one?” That’s good, because it helps you get better.Our first grandchild, Sami, is now two and our second, Zoe, was born last month. It’s a very exciting time for us. In this world, there are so many mothers and grandmothers who can’t feed their own family, so we are very lucky, very fortunate, that we have plenty to eat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fffc3324c89f29dd0f28eab6eb088728fd4d95b2/83_230_3809_2286/master/3809.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abc19d310cf78934b550ab84b70124ed","title":"jose mourinho manchester united brighton","story":"Manchester United’s manager once held sway over all he surveyed but he has lost the control he cravesJosé Mourinho’s irritation with the “movie” that Manchester City released last week was mild compared with his anger at the horror show that Manchester United made him sit through when losing at Brighton in May. He did not want to see a repeat of that performance on his latest visit. But the sequel was worse.In May there was an excuse. Mourinho had not picked a full-strength team, instead giving a clutch of fringe players a chance to impress before the FA Cup final. They blew it. “Some of them are not as good as they think they are,” Mourinho said after that match before confessing to a failure of his own: “I did not succeed in persuading them the points were important.” Maybe he felt like bawling something similar after this reverse but he said he could not reveal his true thoughts.That, like this week’s televisual trolling by the makers of City’s All or Nothing documentary, spoke of the same reality – a world in which Mourinho wields less control than he once did. For most of his career no one could mock his decisions even if they did not admire his vision. Now his neighbours are broadcasting jibes at him from the top of the podium (although he has not become totally powerless, as his well-aimed riposte proved). And his squad contains players who do not seem to be responding to his methods.None of United’s players emerged with credit from this collective malfunction at Brighton. They were chaotic defensively and mostly impotent in attack. Even when they were two goals down they could not summon an onslaught like United teams of old.The displays of Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial were particularly interesting given their relationships with the manager have appeared under strain even if United have scoffed at reports of a clash with Pogba and suggestions that the midfielder would like to leave Old Trafford. The inclusion of Martial here, meanwhile, suggested an attempt to build bridges with a player Mourinho criticised last month for leaving United’s tour to attend the birth of his child.Pogba started the season well during United’s win over Leicester but consistency has eluded him at United and he did not even make it two good performances in a row here.Martial ballooned a cross from the left over the bar in the seventh minute and that was all he did in the first half until getting booked for pulling down Anthony Knockaert. He could have been replaced during the break but Mourinho withdrew Juan Mata instead, the Spaniard having been even less effective, notably forsaking Ashley Young to cope with two attackers in the buildup to Brighton’s first goal. Martial did not improve and was replaced on the hour.Pogba was involved in Brighton’s second goal, making a feeble attempt to clear a corner before the ball ricocheted around the penalty area and Shane Duffy scored. That was symptomatic of Pogba’s performance. Some observers have a base tendency to talk up his physical prowess to the detriment of his finesse but here he showed almost no qualities at all. Displays such as this will endear him neither to United nor to would-be buyers such as Barcelona.Pogba converted a penalty in stoppage time but his contribution was better encapsulated by a vignette in the first period when he tried to pirouette between Glenn Murray and Knockaert midway inside his own half. He was dispossessed easily and then fouled Knockaert.Pogba had hoped to spend most of the match on the front foot after being assigned an advanced role in front of the two janitors in United’s midfield, Andreas Pereira and Fred. That scheme had looked tolerable against Leicester even though Claude Puel’s side had spells of dominance – at least United had looked solid. But here their midfield flailed in the face of Brighton’s dynamism.Pereira, making his second start after being forgiven by Mourinho for going on loan to Spain last season against the manager’s advice, was removed at half-time after several misplaced passes and lost duels.United’s midfield flakiness exposed their inadequacy at the back. Victor Lindelöf and Eric Bailly were often discombobulated in the centre while Young floundered at right-back. The panic that preceded Brighton’s third goal – a penalty following a foul by Bailly – was typical.As Mourinho surveyed the mess from the sideline, he no doubt found himself pining for the defensive recruits he had hoped to sign this summer. But Lindelöf and Bailly were bought on his watch and now transfers are another thing over which he no longer has as much control. There are many people at United who need to get a grip."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/539f5d82eb4617727b3f04ec4199e7696bd8fef3/0_135_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c624f27a63b5d67f3f335c98a151bfec","title":"lazio fans tell women to stay away from stadiums sacred space","story":"Lazio’s notorious ultras have caused outrage by telling women to avoid their “sacred space” in the Stadio Olimpico in a message written on flyers and distributed ahead of their team’s Serie A opener at home to Napoli.“The Curva Nord represents for us a sacred space, an environment with an unwritten code to be respected,” read the flyer. “The first few rows, as always, have been experienced like the trenches. In the trenches, we do not allow women, wives and girlfriends, so we invite them to position themselves from the 10th row back.Lazio spokesman Arturo Diaconale told Italian news agency Ansa after the team fell to a 2-1 defeat on Sunday that “it is not the position of the club, we are against any discrimination.”He added: “Moreover, there is an enormous number of Lazio fans, this instead is an initiative from a few fans. We can’t always intervene to avoid politically incorrect displays like this.”Some Lazio fans caused outrage last season when they littered the Stadio Olimpico in Rome with images of Anne Frank, the young diarist who died in the Holocaust, wearing a Roma shirt. Lazio were fined 50,000 euros (then $63,000) by the Italian football federation because of the anti-Semitism displayed by the team’s fans.It was the latest in a series of racist and anti-Semitic incidents, with Lazio previously having their stadium fully or partly closed for European and domestic matches as punishment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/266518f5e77e77bc8bb9b8e3342cd4eb05b85a0c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc25d603d9eb770128e25fb72e8410dc","title":"premier league 10 talking points from the weekend action","story":"Burnley already suffering effects of Europe, the flipside to N’Golo Kanté’s new role and Wolves’s strikers struggling to match team’s midfield talentBrighton upstaged Manchester United, but that they did so without the help of any of their headline summer signings (Alireza Jahanbakhsh, Yves Bissouma and Bernardo, who cost a combined £41m) is proof they are only just getting started. An opening-day defeat by Watford was desperately disappointing but, as poor as United were, Brighton bossed this match from start to finish. Martín Montoya, a deadline-day arrival from Valencia, impressed on his debut but it was the presence of the wily Glenn Murray and the purring Pascal Gross, a £3m buy from Ingolstadt, that again proved pivotal. Better still, Chris Hughton still has a wealth of attacking talent, including the striker Florin Andone, to infuse his team with. This kind of match will not necessarily define Brighton’s season but they naturally foster optimism. Ben Fisher Burnley are not in the Europa League yet – they still face a final play‑off against Olympiakos beginning this week – but the curse seems to be taking effect. Most uncharacteristically Sean Dyche made half a dozen changes for the last tie against Istanbul Basaksehir, so it is probably not fatigue that is to blame – at least not fatigue from playing extra matches. Yet tiredness from long midweek trips cannot be ruled out, and nor can the hours lost in training and preparation. At least part of the reason Burnley finished seventh last season was because they were able to give the Premier League their unided attention, and Dyche is very good at all the small details that go into readying his side to face bigger opponents. Watford hardly count as that, but they played very well at Turf Moor it was the home side who were a shadow of their usual selves. Burnley are playing more games than anyone else and it shows. Paul WilsonBefore kick-off in Cardiff, Earth, Wind \u0026amp Fire’s 1978 hit September had feet wagging around the stadium and, given what’s on the menu for Neil Warnock’s side next month, it was a fitting reminder of the importance of getting off the mark against Newcastle. They host Arsenal and Manchester City and visit Chelsea and Burnley across four weeks but the Cardiff manager, who takes his team to Huddersfield before that testing run of fixtures, knows home form will be pivotal: they have lost just once at their own ground in 2018. “We are going to take one or two drubbings in this league, so we just have to not read too many papers at times, when things aren’t going so well and just stick to the task,” Warnock said. “I think this stadium can become a fortress, really. Even the top-six sides, I don’t think they’ll enjoy coming here.” BFSeveral factors were behind the wild entertainment on show at Stamford Bridge on Saturday and one of them was undoubtedly what must now be referred to as The Curious Case of N’Golo Kanté. As was the case against Huddersfield Town on the opening day, a midfielder renowned for his defensive excellence was a notable attacking presence. On 78 minutes he almost scored with a header that flashed just over and was then one of the most advanced players in blue when Marcos Alonso struck late on. Kanté is revelling in the freedom Maurizio Sarri has given him but could the manager’s boldness have the effect of reducing Chelsea’s solidity? There were certainly occasions when Arsenal found pockets of space outside Chelsea’s area that Kanté would have been in, had he not been on another charge upfield. Sachin NakraniUnai Emery preached calm after the game on Saturday, aware his job at Arsenal is but two games old and nobody can fix their mess in that short amount of time. Hopefully he will get that patience and calm, but along the way he needs a bit of help from his players, too. What he doesn’t need is players spurning simple chances, but that’s what he will get with the players at his disposal. Regular watchers of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at Borussia Dortmund will tell you that the striker is capable of the implausible, both good and bad: he will oscillate between brilliant goals and the sort of blooper we saw in the first-half on Saturday, as he skied a shot over a virtually open goal from 10 yards out. The unpredictability of his forward line is just another thing Emery will have to deal with. Nick MillerThe first thing to say is that Wolves will play a lot worse than they did at Leicester and win this season. The woodwork thwarted them on three separate occasions and Matt Doherty missed a sitter when the game was goalless. Adama Traoré produced a bright cameo that showed just how dangerous he can be with his electric pace, while João Moutinho and Rúben Neves are a class act in the centre of midfield. Yet only time will tell whether Wolves have enough quality in the striker department. Although Raúl Jiménez made some intelligent runs and was unlucky to hit a post, the Mexican is not a prolific goalscorer, while Léo Bonatini, who came off the bench and made a hash of a chance that Traoré set up, managed only 12 goals in 43 Championship games. It will be a shame for Wolves if some of their hugely impressive creativity goes to waste. Stuart JamesMauricio Pochettino’s six-minute answer to a question about Toby Alderweireld gave Tottenham’s Kremlinologists much to chew on. For the uninitiated, a summary: there may have been troubles in the past but everyone in the matchday squad against Fulham (the Belgian included) was now committed to the cause. Such commitment is something Pochettino has been talking about since pre-season and, one is free to infer, it may not have been present last term, when Alderweireld barely featured during the run-in. But on Saturday we were reminded what he brings to Tottenham: strength, intelligence and ball play. Spurs looked much more confident with him in the side. After a summer in which the club failed to add to their ranks, having Alderweireld available this season may be an advantage worth talking about. Paul MacInnesIt is hugely encouraging for a team as settled as Bournemouth that David Brooks already appears to have a good understanding of Eddie Howe’s demands. The midfielder’s performance in in the win against Manuel Pellegrini’s unbalanced West Ham demonstrated the value of dipping into the Championship and the early signs are Howe has found a big talent. The Wales international was the only new signing to start for Bournemouth at the London Stadium and the 21‑year‑old did not look fazed by his lack of Premier League experience, creating a fine chance for Callum Wilson, almost scoring twice and earning the free‑kick that led to Steve Cook’s winner. “The only surprise for me has been how quickly he’s adapted to the position because last season he was playing as a No 10 for Sheffield United,” Howe said. “We’ve used him as a wide player and he’s settled very well.” Jacob Steinberg"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0e0271d57ae9456dc90b056a259c91cc7e8ec94/0_301_5352_3211/master/5352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=485c7a6439221cb639cf647d021d7a0e","title":"super cup reaction and celtics champions league exit football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden and co on Atlético’s win over Madrid, European woe for Celtic and Bristol Rovers’ dubious half-time entertainmentRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

There is no support for people considering a home battery.James Thornton, CEO of environmental law group ClientEarth, which commissioned the research, said: “Government policy is plainly at odds with public sentiment – and its own ambition to tackle climate change – as far as our energy sources are concerned. “People want to know more and take ownership of how they get their energy – that’s clearly demonstrated by the broad support in the poll for household solar and community energy schemes.”Solar installers have told the  that, increasingly, people are also opting for home batteries when they buy solar.Energy storage is also making inroads at utility scale. On Monday, water company Anglian Water will announce it has bought a 300 kilowatt hour (kWh) storage system from UK-based firm redT, for use at a water treatment site alongside solar panels.Solar was ranked the most popular of all energy sources in the ClientEarth survey, while gas was second worst behind coal.

They saved an average of £298 a year, or £3.3m collectively.The success suggests minor reforms could tackle the energy market’s problem of poorer, older and less educated people paying over the odds for default tariffs, reducing the need for a major intervention such as the government’s price cap.Rather than those consumers having to provide their existing tariff and energy usage in order to switch, as they usually do, the information was supplied automatically. That allowed the comparison site to send letters offering a personalised saving.Ofgem hailed the trial as its most successful to date. “Offering a simplified collective switch and providing personalised savings can be a big help in giving these customers the confidence and reassurance they need to start a switch,” said Rob Salter-Church, interim executive director for consumers and markets.The positive results have sparked plans for a bigger trial of 200,000 in the autumn, expected to involve either British Gas or SSE.The energy regulator said, however, that it was too early to say if having energy tariff and consumption information pre-supplied would become the default way to switch in future.The company effectively recreates the Ofgem test, allowing customers to be automatically switched into the best offers on the market.

The chief executive of Best for Britain, Eloise Todd, said: “These figures show that Labour would make real gains in the country from a clear anti-Brexit position. With Labour voters and national public opinion shifting against Brexit, it’s time for the opposition to give people what they want: a clear choice on Brexit between leaving and staying and reforming the EU, not a fudged deal that works for Westminster elites and no one else.”Labour has said it will vote against any final Brexit deal unless it meets the shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer’s six tests on protection of jobs and rights, which in practice is highly unlikely. Downing Street has calculated that it will need the support of some Labour MPs if the deal has a chance of being passed in the Commons in November, and the Cabinet Office has given briefings to opposition MPs.Jeremy Corbyn has said his party would push for a general election rather than a referendum on the deal should Theresa May fail to get her proposed agreement with the EU through parliament.Party strategists have calculated that Labour retains the vast majority of remain supporters’ votes and that its electoral prospects are reliant on winning back or retaining the support of working-class leave voters.Any move to soften the party’s Brexit position is likely to be fiercely opposed by some Labour backbenchers.MPs from leave constituencies, including Caroline Flint and Gareth Snell, spoke out against party colleagues who had pushed for the party to support an amendment to keep the UK in a Norway-style single market deal during the EU withdrawal bill’s passage through the Commons this summer.That vote saw Labour MPs split three ways, rebelling on both sides against a whip to abstain, exposing the party’s isions over Europe.Senior Labour figures are considering how to head off a concerted attempt by remain-supporting members to stage a vote at its annual conference calling for a second referendum. Around 130 constituency Labour parties are understood to be willing to back a motion in favour of a second vote, drafted by the pro-Corbyn campaign group Labour for a People’s Vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/010bb415b35ab76d53ce140e91f19640442b5444/0_223_4056_2433/master/4056.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03460bf6f18fef7d74c1033ca05a8139","title":"mps ask for expenses budgets to be raised to cover brexit costs","story":"Former minister says requests for more money show MPS are ‘out of touch with public’MPs are asking for their expenses budgets to be increased to help them manage an increased workload resulting from Brexit, the parliamentary watchdog has revealed.A poll last year of MPs and their staff by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) said there had been demands from politicians and staff to give them more money to cover their higher costs. “There were further requests to further increase MP staffing budgets due to their increasing workloads, some of which is the result of Brexit,” the report published last month said.Responding to the revelation, Sir Kevin Barron, chairman of the committee on standards, told the : “It is essential that Ipsa achieves value for money as we are all funded by taxpayers’ money.“Requests for contingency funding should be judged inidually on their merits but only awarded where the need is clear.”Some 93 people responded to the 2017 survey – a sharp decrease from 366 respondents in the previous year. It is not known who or how many parliamentary staff made the request.MPs are currently given a £150,900 annual staffing budget – increased to £161,550 in London.Ipsa was set up in the wake of the MPs expenses scandal almost 10 years ago in an effort to increase transparency concerning pay and business costs.The revelations of how much politicians were claiming sent shockwaves through Westminster and beyond, with details emerging of frivolous and excessive spending including a miniature island to house ducks in former Tory MP Peter Viggers’ duck pond.MPs have seen a gradual increase in pay from £65,738 in 2010 to £77,379 this year.Ipsa announced last year that it would no longer provide funding for new “connected parties” - spouses and family members employed by MPs - after last year’s general election.The committee on standards in public life welcomed the changes, saying: “Although many provide an excellent service, it was considered that employment of family members was out of step with modern employment practice and not consistent with proper use of public funds.”Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the committee, told the : “Ipsa should be very cautious about raising budgets.“It would be quite wrong to automatically agree an increase in the staff budget if there’s a danger some of it goes to improve the family income rather than as a service to the public ...

It was a particular problem in the crowded, polluted towns and cities of 19th-century Britain and is often assumed to be a Victorian disease.“This is something that prompted us to look at the Roman period,” said Simon Mays, a human skeletal biologist at Historic England. “In Victorian times we normally associate it with the rise of urban living, and of course the Roman empire saw the first widespread urbanisation in Europe. Might we find it there as well?”During the three-year project, researchers examined skeletons from northern England to southern Spain, looking for the deformities generally seen in rickets. Evidence for rickets was found in more than one in 20 children, with most cases in infants.“The big surprise to me was how young most of the sufferers were,” said Mays. “Some were suffering even in the first few months of life. The inescapable conclusion was that people were keeping their infants indoors too much.”Quite why mothers might have been staying inside with their children is open for debate. “One tends to assume most women would have gone out and worked in agriculture: this throws open the possibility that that did not happen.”The research reveals that Britain had the most rickets, presumably because of the cloudy skies and rainy climate.Unlike in Victorian times, Roman-period rickets was less common in towns than in cities, apart from one place: Ostia in Italy, a port on the Tiber, which was densely populated with many people living in the equivalent of multi-storey apartment buildings.Megan Brickley, of McMaster University, the principal investigator on the project, said: “Living in apartments with small windows, in blocks that were closely spaced around courtyards and narrow streets, may have meant that many children weren’t exposed to enough sunlight to prevent vitamin D deficiency.”The research, published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, shows that vitamin D deficiency is far from being a new problem. But it also has pointers for how we should live today.Mays said: “It shows how important getting out in to the sunshine is. We tend to be a little nervous of getting kids exposed because of the risk of skin cancer and quite rightly so … but this shows you can take sunlight avoidance too far and I think that was happening in Roman times and they were paying the penalty in cases of rickets.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd422ff246b662cde45c6dc9d6608d5b23019954/61_38_1359_815/master/1359.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5fb91b25f1aafb00aa7d6566c01b6db","title":"jos buttler england fantastic atmosphere","story":"• Buttler: ‘The key is trying not to make the same mistakes’• ‘There’s a fantastic atmosphere in England’s changing room’Jos Buttler admits England do not know why they continue to endure catastrophic collapses that are costing them Tests, following a chastening second day in Nottingham.England, replying to India’s first innings of 329, were routed for 161 during an action-packed afternoon. It was the third time in two years they have lost 10 wickets inside a session, following similar implosions against Bangladesh in Dhaka in November 2016 and against New Zealand in Auckland in March. No England team had managed such a fate between 1938 and 2016. It leaves India, who closed 292 runs ahead on 124 for two in their second innings, in complete control of this third Test.Asked if he knew why the collapses kept occurring, Buttler said: “Obviously not, if it keeps happening. Rightly people say it’s been happening too often – which it has. Guys have got to improve. We know that as a side to get to where we want to go we need to eradicate these collapses.“The key is trying not to make the same mistakes. You can’t keep doing the same thing over and over again, whether that’s as an inidual or as a team. If there’s an obvious weakness as an inidual, you need to work on it. As a team, is there a similar thing we need to make sure it’s not happening?“There’s no real substitute for hard work. We know in England conditions can be tough – favourable for swing bowling. Credit to India, I thought they bowled really well and got the ball moving around, and we weren’t good enough to deal with that today.“There’s no magic answer, I don’t think, apart from hard work. It looks like, when one side has that momentum, it seems hard to wrestle back.”Despite what seems a hopeless situation Buttler says Joe Root’s team, who are 2-0 up in the series, genuinely believe they can save this Test. “Yes, of course. Otherwise there’s no point turning up,” he said.“I think any professional sportsman takes pride in playing for their country and we’ll turn up tomorrow and we’ll be fighting hard. No one’s going to give up or throw the towel in.”England showed signs of frustration in the field during the final session as India built on their first-innings lead, with one incident in the 23rd over of the visitors’ second innings seeing the usually mild-mannered Chris Woakes chastise Adil Rashid for failing to prevent a boundary off his bowling.Buttler, though, insists team spirit is good despite the grim situation the home side face in this match. “There’s a fantastic atmosphere in the changing-room. The group gel well together. There’s a real good feel about it,” he said.“Experience tells you there is no magic key to getting things right. Nobody’s perfect and there’s human error – we’ve got to be better. Everyone is striving to be the best they can. It’s not for a lack of trying.”Buttler also insisted England did not suffer from complacency coming into this match despite blowing away Virat Kohli’s team by an innings in the previous Test at Lord’s.“I’m not sure India were ever going to go anywhere,” he said. “They’re the No 1-ranked side in the world and they’re there for a reason, so they were always going to come back strongly. It was always going to be a competitive series. Just because they were 2-0 down I don’t think we could have taken anything lightly.”Hardik Pandya, the all-rounder whose maiden five-wicket haul in Tests was central to England’s collapse, admitted India pinpointed the weaknesses in the home batting line-up to take a stranglehold on this match. “Yes, they have a few important players and, if you get them out, they get in trouble,” he said. “They have problems but we don’t relax until we get all players out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94df71c37a2c039fd27cb23e622a6d55de4cfcde/179_0_2609_1565/master/2609.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20f29f1453d0712d76044cb135503641","title":"london broncos leeds rhinos super 8s match report","story":"• London Broncos 32-48 Leeds Rhinos• Leeds close to preserving Super League statusLeeds Rhinos moved a step closer to preserving their Super League status after surviving a rousing fightback from London Broncos at Ealing.This has been a season to forget for Leeds and, though they are still visibly below the levels which took them to Super League glory for the eighth time last October, there are clearly signs of improvement since the arrival of Kevin Sinfield as coach.While London performed superbly in the final quarter here, scoring 22 unanswered points, by then the game had long since been won by Leeds. The Rhinos now have two wins from their opening two Qualifiers. Three victories from their final five games will ensure a top-three finish and an instant return to Super League in 2019 without the need for the Million Pound Game. Leeds were in complete control by half-time, scoring five tries to London’s one to lead 28-6 against a Broncos side who watched by Martin Offiah, fought valiantly in the final stages when the result was long since secured for Leeds.The Broncos’ experience has been somewhat nomadic since their formation in 1980, with Ealing their ninth home in their 38-year existence. But, with Widnes in danger of relegation in this year’s Qualifiers, there is the possibility of a Championship side gaining promotion and London, whose junior development line continues to improve, could yet be that side.Points difference could also be crucial in the race for the Million Pound Game, which may make the late flurry here from London – who, with one win from their first two games, remain handily placed – all the more vital come the end of the Qualifiers. “You worried where it was going at one point,” said their coach, Danny Ward, a teammate of Sinfield during their playing days at Leeds. “Hopefully there’s more days like this for London rugby league, though.”A 15-minute hat-trick for the centre Joel Moon helped to put Leeds in control by half-time and later tries from Ashton Golding and Carl Ablett made it 48-10 at one stage. London, though, finished with a flourish, with tries by Daniel Hindmarsh and Ben Evans adding a shade of respectability to the scoreline which the Broncos’ efforts merited."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/991bec4bae599f50285fc3370c4d733480bdea07/0_432_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1bf9895e9fa409a48a4be92157c9001","title":"manchester city fantom","story":"Champions have found yet another way of making money, a wristband that tells you everything they want you to knowMen and women of a certain age will fondly remember ClubCall, the pre-internet, pre-mobile telephone service that cornered the market in ludicrously overpriced football tittle-tattle, interviews and match commentaries.For up to 48p a minute of their own – or ideally a parent or employer’s money – fans could dial an advertised number to listen in on deliberately long-winded and often factually dubious updates about their club. For many, the alternative of being forced to endure the trauma of waiting for classified results, TV highlights or the morning and evening newspapers which furnished them with similar, but considerably less sketchy information at a far less prohibitive price, was just too much to bear.All over the UK and Ireland, the permission of bill-payers often went resolutely unasked as football devotees furtively dialled up to be told v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y what was going on at their club. An innovative precursor to the even more lucrative sex chatline industry that continues to flourish in its wake, ClubCall can rightfully consider itself a pioneer in the field of premium-rate call services that made needy grown men groan, sweat and tingle with excitement.The internet eventually did for ClubCall and while it still exists, after a fashion, there is a certain irony that it is now just a written news service available only in website form. The prevalence of rolling sports news, around-the-ground commentaries, legal and illegal streaming, live score services, social media and football club websites allows fans to access whatever information about their own or any other football club that happens to be “out there” with a couple of swipes and jabs on their touchscreen. Crucially, they are no longer required to pay through the nose – or indeed at all – for most of these privileges.Of course, if any football club was going to identify the inherent flaws in such technology, it was always likely to be Manchester City. Their infamous Tunnel Club suggests that a football club capable of monetising the sight of their players lining up for combat, adjusting their shorts and shouting “C’mon boys!” is capable of anything. More recently, the release of All Or Nothing, the fly-on-the-wall documentary José Mourinho hasn’t seen but considers classless, invited rubberneckers into the sanctuary of the dressing room in the hope of further enhancing City’s global brand. Small wonder, then, that it is also the Premier League champions who have become the first football club on the planet to embrace “the Fantom”.Billed as “the world’s first smartband” and available for £79.99 a throw, the Fantom is to all intents and purposes an electronic bracelet that provides wearers with the kind of “inside information”, in-game stats, polls and quizzes they can quite literally find anywhere else on the internet without having to pay the thick end of £80 for a piece of branded tat. Aimed at the fan who wants “247 breaking news about City, from City, packaged in a premium aluminium housing with touch display and soft silicone straps”, this propaganda tool doesn’t so much tell everything you need to know about City, as everything they want you to know.Its unique selling point, one which manufacturers Turnpike Fantom and Manchester City have been pushing keenly in their promotional material, is that the Fantom “lives on your skin”, enabling wearers to bypass the arduous and time-consuming process of actually having to remove their phones from their pockets when getting the latest hot takes from the Etihad Stadium.Curiously, they seem to have absolutely no problem discouraging anyone they think might buy it from reaching for their wallets.But don’t take their word for it, let’s hear from some satisfied customers. “You don’t have to get your phone out to check things,” says John, a City fan and one of around 100 like-minded iniduals who helped develop and workshop the new gizmo. “You don’t have to scroll through Twitter and things like that. You just turn your wrist and it’s there instantly. As soon as you get a buzz on your wrist, you look and it’s there. Done.”Of course, the benefits of not having to scroll through Twitter and things like that cannot be overstated and Stephen was even more enthused. A City supporter for more than 60 years, he has seen his club win five league titles, five League Cups, two FA Cups and the European Cup Winners’ Cup. He has been through thick and thin, experiencing the delirium of celebrating those seismic goals scored by Paul Dickov and Sergio Agüero. He has watched some of the most exciting players in world football pull on his club’s shirt before strutting their stuff as regulars on the Champions League stage. Only last season, he bore regular witness to his team playing some of the most spellbinding football ever played in the English top flight. And his thoughts on the Fantom? “It’s the best thing I’ve ever seen from Manchester City.”According to Andrew Gilligan, City Football Group’s Head of Research \u0026amp Insights (no, me neither), the Fantom is a “matchday companion” that will in time enable the club to “analyse how our fans are behaving” by monitoring their matchday behaviour and – more intriguingly – matchday spending. Stephen’s unbridled enthusiasm for the smartband that lives on the skin of fans suggests it might also be messing with their minds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c30871020a1f5913f7a189f20fd3f1c0983c567/0_45_3107_1865/master/3107.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8939b3da2f168bf0a57cfd4061269650","title":"novak djokovic roger federer cincinnati masters tennis","story":"Novak Djokovic finally won the tournament that had been eluding him, beating Roger Federer 6-4, 6-4 on Sunday for his first Cincinnati Masters title. The Serbian got the better of the players’ first meeting in nearly two years, and triumphed in a tournament that Federer has won seven times, never losing a final.After Federer’s forehand sailed wide for the deciding point, Djokovic raised both arms and roared. Then he jumped and punched the air before giving his racket to a fan and tossing his sweatbands into the stands.Djokovic is the first to claim all nine ATP Masters 1000 events since the series started in 1990. It had become his personal quest after he lost in Cincinnati finals on three previous occasions against Federer.Djokovic leads the pair’s all-time series 24-22, dominating the biggest matches. He is 3-1 against Federer in grand slam finals and 12-6 overall in championship matches, including wins at Wimbledon and the US Open in 2015.Djokovic completed a long comeback from elbow surgery by winning his fourth Wimbledon title last month, then set out to get his hard-court game in order for the US Open. He got better as the rainy week went on in Cincinnati, playing his best tennis at the end.Federer’s serve had been untouchable all week, and he had held for 46 consecutive games. Djokovic broke that streak to go 4-3 up in the opening set, prompting Federer to mutter angrily. Djokovic served out the set, and then traded breaks with Federer early in the second set. Federer’s game was off, and he committed 39 unforced errors as Djokovic took full advantage. He broke him again in the second set to go up 4-3 and served it out. In the women’s final, top-ranked Simona Halep let a match point slip away during the second-set tiebreaker, and Kiki Bertens rallied for a 2-6, 7-6, 6-2 victory in her first hard-court final.One point away from another loss, she had pulled off her biggest win, one that left her as stunned as everyone else. “I cannot find words for this moment,” she said.The Dutch clay-court specialist ended Halep’s streak of nine straight wins, including the title at Montreal a week earlier. She’d never beaten a top-ranked player, but wore down Halep at the end of her two draining weeks.During the week in Cincinnati, Halep had one match suspended overnight by rain and wound up playing twice in one day to reach the semi-finals. She controlled the first set on Sunday and had a chance to close it out, leading 6-5 in the tiebreaker.Bertens has worked on her hard-court game and her confidence on the surface. In three previous appearances in Cincinnati, she won a total of one match. She became the first unseeded player to win in Cincinnati since Vera Zvonareva in 2006.

But, far from suggesting that gay is new orthodoxy, Seavey is confronting the age-old conflict between monogamous commitment and sexual freedom and asking whether progressive legislation can ever resolve tangled relationships. They’re intriguing questions but, running at an uninterrupted 1hr 45min, the play errs on the side of prolixity. Seavey jumps around in time between 2006 and 2011 while charting the ups and downs of a relationship between two characters. One, called The Writer, is radical, Jewish and wedded to the idea of sexual experimentation the other, labelled The Academic, is a black guy who teaches media studies and yearns for a permanent partnership. We follow them, though not chronologically, through their first meeting, their crises and their disruptive encounter with a third party named Dan. Meanwhile, the nation’s gradual progress towards the legalisation of same-sex marriage merely exacerbates the tensions between them. The play makes some sharp points about the hypocrisy of closeted politicians and the persistence of homophobia, but there is something hermetic about the exclusive focus on a single relationship: it comes as a relief when The Writer finally enters a shop to buy bath bombs from a female sales assistant. In all truth, I enjoyed the performance and production more than the play. The high point came from watching Harry McEntire’s expressive features as The Writer, move from lively curiosity to appalled dismay, as he realised that Dan (Dan Krikler) is not only a potential rival but also an accomplished wordsmith. Tyrone Huntley as The Academic registers precisely the character’s mix of sexual abandon and spiritual earnestness. Cash Holland as the soap-seller pops up all too briefly, and Josh Seymour’s direction and Lee Newby’s sand-filled stage give the action a physical life. But, while Seavey plausibly suggests that changes to the law do not offer a permanent fix, I still wished his characters got out into the world a bit more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12007a9d55bdcabfeff37f687e3bfc6eeb16d4bd/563_536_3287_1973/master/3287.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e83ac4671aeef136d00dfaf9dae145c","title":"the community space bringing scandinavian chic to glasgow","story":"For Fika Sake has become the centre of a thriving community in the heart of Scotland’s largest city, as part cafe, part learning space and lifestyle hubThe idea for an events space centred around coffee and cake was inspired by a place where so many good things originate – Scandinavia. Fika is the most recent Swedish tradition spreading across the globe. “It’s about taking time out of your day to actually sit down and maybe relax with someone or maybe yourself – usually over coffee and cake,” says Simon Forsythe, Glasgow-based owner of For Fika Sake.Forsythe’s space is part cafe, part community hangout and part creative workplace. Covering 185 sq m (2,000 sq ft) in the centre of Glasgow, For Fika Sake is drawing in everyone from students and freelancers to yogis and parenting groups who want to engage with other locals and like-minded people while learning something new.Forsythe brought the idea to life in January 2016, opening the doors after a year of planning. “It started when I was having fika at a cafe in town with a friend,” he says. “I was working a part-time job in a normal cafe and was fed up with that experience. She was running music workshops in Glasgow and wanted to work on a different project.” After bringing in one other partner, they came up with the name: For Fika Sake. “We thought up a funny, controversial title, a play on words and we stuck with that and went with it,” says Forsythe.The sense of community created by the cafe extends beyond its doors – the coffee, tea, and cake that give the space its name are sourced from local suppliers. On any day of the week you can walk into For Fika Sake to find people filling the space with music from an old piano donated by a local social enterprise, in pottery workshops run by local artists up on the mezzanine, discussing their latest reads during a book club, or catching up with friends.“It’s great to have this kind of community coming in and using the space for what it was originally designed for,” says Forsythe. “One in particular that stands out is the community for young parents. The big space means they can come in and store their prams in the corner and hang out with other parents and their babies.”After a challenging start, seeing the space come to life has been the big payoff for Forsythe. In December 2016, he had to take on the business himself after his two partners left to pursue other projects. “It was a bit of a shock,” he says. “But the business seems to have taken off since last January.” While he admits it was tough, particularly with the other stresses that come with starting a new small business – like big overheads – he says one of the perks to come out of it is being able to make decisions quickly and easily. “There was no compromise-with-partners involved, so I was able to get things done and out of the way,” he says.Now word of mouth has spread and the business is growing, and that quick decision-making is allowing Forsythe to try new ideas and systems to keep things running smoothly. He recently switched over to a new platform to help him get on top of his cashflow. He chose Square because he liked the “cool and simple” card machine – but also because he could access his funds the next working day.“It’s made a massive difference,” he says. “With this kind of business the most important thing for survival is cashflow, so being able to access your funds the next working day is a serious win. If it’s over the weekend you get your cash on Monday rather than Wednesday.”It’s also given him the time and freedom to focus on drumming up creative ideas for new workshops and events to help the cafe thrive. But if creating a community hub was the grand idea behind the space, it’s the cafe and fostering the tradition around fika that Forsythe reckons is the powerhouse of the enterprise. “It keeps the business going and it creates that space for people to use the workshop side of things,” he says.Using Square’s app, he can create a product button for a new kind of service on the spot – a convenience he appreciates, given the ever-changing use of the space and the introduction of new workshops and events. “Overall, it’s running nice and smoothly and going with that original plan, which is amazing to see.”Where does he see himself next? Hopefully with a second space, in a few years, although perhaps somewhere sunnier. “I’d love to see it grow and take on another premises in another part of Glasgow or potentially in another city,” he says. “But working on what we have right now and just gearing up more towards the community and growing it within this community is still number one.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3e99511bd64b52e4843bec74291aff083fac8ca/0_280_5130_3078/master/5130.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e2a65312ce0de717a9c9244fb99b86a","title":"sainte maxime france cote d azure holiday saint tropez","story":"Bypassed by superyachts and ignored by paparazzi, the little town of Sainte-Maxime across the bay offers a classy French Riviera break without the glitz and high pricesThere are more bakers and butchers than nightclubs and nail bars in Sainte-Maxime, just north of Saint-Tropez in Provence’s Var département. And colourful fishing boats land the day’s catch right on the harbour.Less ritzy than many of its Côte d’Azur neighbours, this small town has an unflashy lifestyle suited less to film stars than to the saint it is named after. Maxime was a daughter of a ninth-century Count of Grasse, who rejected his wealth, turned her back on her family and took herself off to nearby Callian, where she founded a convent. A painting in the stark, local church shows her refusing a coffer of gold.Opposite the church is the Tour Carrée, Sainte-Maxime’s only real historic monument, a fortified blockhouse built in 1520 to defend the coast against Saracen pirates. Today, it’s a museum of local history (open 3pm-6pm Wed-Sun, adult €3).Sainte-Maxime remained a tiny port throughout the 18th century: wine, olive oil, vegetables and cork from the Maures forest were loaded on to tartanes (small sailing vessels) and shipped along the coast. The trading port has now been replaced by a marina with 800 moorings.Just behind the marina, the traffic-free Promenade Aymeric Simon-Lorière, shaded by pines, palms and cacti, leads to a gravel and sand beach. There are boules courts (floodlit for evenings), with balls to hire from an on-site hut. A game costs just €2 (€3 on Wednesday and Saturday).Le Bistrot de Louis on narrow place Colbert is another favourite: its three-course menu du bistro (€26) is worth the money: faultless fish soup, sea bream filet and a dame blanche (vanilla ice-cream, whipped cream and chocolate sauce). For less formal eating try Le Porche, in a medieval archway off rue d’Alsace, which does burgers of several kinds for around €11.50, with chips and salad.On summer evenings, the streets around Place du Marché come alive with the stalls selling jewellery, straw hats and provençal lavender soaps. There’s live music and locals hang out around the stone lavoir – the old public laundry – eating ice-cream. The indoor morning market merits a browse too – pick up cheese, fruit and rotisserie chicken or indulge in the oyster bar at the back.For the best beach action, follow the coast road east and north, past giant parasol pines and gated villas, to Plage de la Nartelle, 2km of sand with parasols and water sports. Beside the road sit the rusted remains of an amphibious Sherman tank used in the Allied landings on 15 August 1944. Damaged by a German land mine, the tank remained buried under the sand until a storm in 2011, and has since been part-restored. French resistance fighters in Sainte-Maxime were informed of the landings by two coded messages transmitted by the BBC in London: “Nancy a le torticolis” (Nancy has a stiff neck) and “Le chef est affamé” (The chef is famished).Whichever beach you are on, the view across the gulf is of the flesh-coloured facades of Saint-Tropez. Ferries operated by Les Bateaux Verts run to the resort every 15 minutes from Sainte-Maxime marina. Visitors imagine they’ll spend the day in Saint-Tropez, but three hours is probably enough time to watch the superyachts coming in and out, visit the Annonciade art museum and wander the narrow streets.Saint-Tropez can be intense in the summer. Its tanned, pampered denizens parade around in a uniform of sparkling white beach tunics, macramé bikinis and pastel shorts, their hair swept back and a raffia basket slung over one slender, tanned arm. Copycats arrive on shiny motorbikes or in open-top sports cars, but they are easy to spot – shabby St-Trop is a hard look to pull off.Sainte-Maxime may be Saint-Tropez’s less showy little sister but it still has the feel of a classy riviera resort: it has its own casino and, as in other places, men can be fined €38 for going shirtless away from the beach. It’s refreshing to find such an unpretentious base on this stretch of coast – but fun to be able to dip into the nearby glitz too.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

One competitive soul went full Partridge – and Martin Kemp ended up in hospitalOn paper, it sounds like a dreadful idea: take four celebrities, with a partner apiece, put them in some old cars and let them race each other on dangerous jungle roads until Martin Kemp ends up in hospital. There is also a part of me that immediately says: “Yeah, I’d watch that.” So I did.Much of the pre-publicity that Eight Go Rallying: The Road to Saigon (BBC Two) received was down to one participant, Noel Edmonds, slagging off the whole enterprise as fakery. His complaint might have had more merit if it had been his first time on television. The programme was open about all the behind-the-scenes trickery involved in not killing famous people. There was a real endurance rally taking place – 1,900 miles from Chiang Mai in Thailand to Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, in Vietnam – but the celebrity pairs were merely camp followers, competing for their own made-up trophy. There was obviously a huge support team on hand and their services were frequently required. When Miquita Oliver’s mum, Andi, got too tired to drive (Miquita was no help she failed her test), their car was put on a low-loader and a taxi was called.It may have amounted to a gap-year trek on wheels, but at least the cars were genuinely ill-suited to the task: Mr and Mrs Edmonds were given a classic MGB GT Martin and Shirlie Kemp got a 1972 Mini the musicians Tinchy Stryder and Jordan Stephens piloted a Hillman Imp the Olivers a ’59 Morris Minor. The teams were obliged to navigate with a Tulip map – which uses balls and arrows to guide the user – and therefore spent much of the initial leg driving in circles and bickering. Imagine the first half hour of your holiday, just after you leave the airport car park, and you are pretty much there.That is not to say there was no drama or that it was all contrived. Not far out of Chiang Mai, Tinchy and Jordan destroyed their Hillman’s engine on a steep mountain road. The Kemps rolled their Mini during a time trial, leaving Martin trapped inside (he escaped with a bruised hand). By the close of the second day, half the teams were consigned to completing the next leg by minibus.If Eight Go Rallying sounds like something Alan Partridge would come up with, we can thank Noel for providing a glimpse of how such a commission might have panned out. He was a fountain of Partridgisms. “Guilty as charged, I’m a competitive person,” he said at one point. “I think my track record in the highly competitive world of broadcasting suggests I’m a competitive person.” And he actually wears driving gloves.In the end, there was plenty of drama, mainly involving Noel slowly realising he was the only one taking the rally part seriously. “What we have to remember is that this is not a race,” he told his wife, Liz. “It’s an experience, which we have to win.” I stand by my assessment: yeah, I’d watch that.Supercars, Superfam (BBC Two) is a sort of bite-size reality soap about brothers Kash and Shabs, who run a successful high-end supercar-customising business and who also still live with their parents, even though Kash has been married for three years and has two kids. They seem to earn a good living between them, they own a lot of expensive motors.There is a good story to be told here, maybe even several good ones: Shabs getting cold feet about his arranged marriage Kash being challenged to a drag race by a rival their sister Mari working as a “modest model”. But the brief episodes (12 minutes long) spend a lot of time reviewing the past and telegraphing the future, while never bothering to alight on anything for long. It looks like a trailer for itself and it is filmed as if the cameraman had accepted a dare to spend the shoot standing on one leg.Explanatory graphics zip by in a bid to stitch one scene to the next, but every episode seems to be fast-forwarding towards an important moment that never arrives. It is not that I am not interested – I am fascinated. I just wish it would sit still long enough for me to watch it.

According to the newspaper, their focus was falling on multi-million dollar loans Cohen received from two New York banks as well as on income his family gained from the city’s yellow taxi business.Federal investigators were also homing in on Cohen’s role in arranging hush money for two women who alleged affairs with Trump before the 2016 presidential election. The pay-offs might have constituted a breach of campaign finance law, the New York Times reported.The darkening cloud of federal prosecutorial interest amid possible imminent charges are likely to substantially crank up pressure on Cohen to co-operate with the on-going investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller. That probe is reaching a critical stage as Mueller seeks to determine whether collusion took place between the Trump campaign and Russia to sway the outcome of the 2016 election.Mueller is facing mounting calls to bring his inquiry to a rapid end before campaigning for the November midterm elections kicks off. Given those demands, any charges against Cohen are likely to be brought by the end of this month or delayed until after election day on 6 November.Cohen has been drawn into the legal purview of both Mueller and other federal investigators since his office and home were searched in April. Since then he has given strong hints that he is prepared to co-operate with prosecutors in exchange for lenient treatment.In July, one of Cohen’s legal team Lanny Davis released to the media a tape in which the attorney could be heard in discussions with Trump. The two were deliberating over a $150,000 deal to buy the silence of a former Playboy model Karen McDougal to prevent her allegations of an affair emerging two months before the 2016 presidential election.According to the New York Times, federal investigators are probing Cohen’s role in arranging hush money for McDougal. They are also interested in a $130,000 payment he helped make to the adult film actor Stephanie Clifford, aka Stormy Daniels, as a possible violation of campaign finance laws that restrict undisclosed donations.The newspaper reported that the focus on possible bank fraud stemmed from the engagement of Cohen in the New York yellow cab industry. In 2014 he took out loans with two financial institutions using 32 taxi medallions owned by the attorney and his family as collateral.The story of Cohen’s alleged legal peril dropped just hours after Trump went on a Twitter rampage in which he likened Mueller to Joseph McCarthy, the Wisconsin senator who led the 1950s clampdown on so-called “un-American” activities.“We are now in period with Mueller and his gang that make Joseph McCarthy look like a baby!” Trump tweeted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aad58216f405abb9f36282a6140ebb5c4570d8fc/0_58_871_523/master/871.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=332460f7371ead2394d35af173c68a2e","title":"kindergarten dresses children as jihadists for parade in indonesia","story":"Manager apologises for independence day march costumes and denies trying to ‘instil violence’ into childrenA kindergarten in Indonesian has been criticised for dressing girls up in black, Isis-style costumes and replica rifles for an independence day parade, with organisers forced to apologise for the embarrassing gaffe.Photos of the “cultural” parade held in the city of Probolinggo, East Java, on Saturday showed lines of young girls marching on the street wearing niqab-style black veils, carrying cardboard cutouts of guns.The head of the TK Kartika kindergarten in Probolinggo apologised “deeply” for the costumes, expressing regret over the decision and saying they were not trying to “instil violence” in the kindergarten children.“We raised the theme of the struggle of the Prophet to increase faith and devotion to Allah,” said kindergarten head Hartatik, when asked to explain the controversial attire.The Probolinggo kindergarten is on the site of an Indonesian military complex, and Saturday’s parade took place a day after independence day, which falls on 17 August, in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation.Asked to explain why the kindergarten had chosen the costumes, Hartatik admitted they had pooled props from previous years to save money.The kindergarten head did not offer any explanation as to why the jihadist-style costumes had been used in previous years.Speaking at a media conference following uproar over the event, Probolinggo military commander, Lieutenant Colonel Kav Depri Rio Saransi said the parade was purely to educate the students about the “struggle of Islam” but was not intended to promote religious radicalism.“There is not the slightest bit of radicalism. I emphasise that purely there is no such thing as an element of intentionally showing the existence of radical activities,” he said, before offering a further apology.Images and videos of the parade went viral on social media in the country and hit the same day that Indonesia opened the 18th Asian Games in a spectacular ceremony in Jakarta, which celebrated the country’s rich cultural ersity.The Probolinggo parade is an embarrassing gaffe for Indonesia as it works to show its best face to the world through the huge sporting event involving 45 countries, the largest of its kind after the Olympics.News of the Probolinggo parade has also reached the Indonesian parliament, with House speaker Bambang Soesatyo describing it as an “inappropriate spectacle”.“Ordering children to wear black veiled costumes and carry replica weapons gives a poor perception,” he said, “Treatment like that could damage children’s ideas.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/931fc86e0de7f57ddf9f5e88b0141bbb22638334/0_147_5982_3590/master/5982.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8c1dea16d86ab4bbcd874146a6d3a79","title":"russian presence divides czechs 50 years after prague spring","story":"Events of 1968 still influence debate about whether Russia should be seen as friend or foeA few times a day, an elderly Czech person will pay a visit to the photography exhibition in Prague’s Old Town Hall, which chronicles the crushing of the Prague Spring by Moscow in 1968, and complain as they leave.“‘The Russians are here again,’ they grumble to me,” said the curator, Dana Kyndrová, describing locals’ views on the thousands of Russian tourists who visit Prague each week and the 30,000 Russians who have residency permits in the Czech Republic.Tuesday marks the 50th anniversary of Moscow sending half a million troops from the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries to crush the reformist government in Czechoslovakia led by Alexander Dubček, which had been attempting to implement “socialism with a human face”.A debate is raging about whether Russia poses a strategic threat to the country today or whether relations should be improved with Moscow in spite of EU sanctions.Most politicians in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia see Russia as a threat, but the Czech president, Miloš Zeman, is an outspoken admirer of Vladimir Putin, while Slovakia was one of a handful of EU countries not to expel any Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in March, after disagreement among the ruling coalition.For some of the older generation, the anger at the Soviet Union from 1968 carries over on to modern Russia and Russians. Kamila Moučková, a television newscaster who was arrested during a live broadcast in August 1968, has said in interviews with the Czech media that even now she finds it hard to be civil towards Russians. Moučková was one of the first Czechoslovakian news anchors and became known for her critical broadcasts in 1968. She was later fired by the broadcaster and went to work in a plastic bag factory, returning to the screen only after the Velvet Revolution in 1989.“After everything the Russians did here, I am not interested in getting to know that country,” she said. “Perhaps I am too old ... to change my view. Until this day, when we play hockey with Russia I do not view it as a sport but as a political matter. I even have to persuade myself internally to behave politely to Russians when they stop me on a street to ask for directions.”After the Velvet Revolution, when Czechoslovakia finally made the transition out of communism, there was a tendency to look at the Prague Spring as merely a spat between different groups of communists. But many of the photographs on display at Kyndrová’s exhibition show how much of a national element there was in the protests.There were signs and graffiti demanding “Russians go home”, and on the Bratislava war memorial someone had drawn a logo equating the Soviet star with the swastika.Kyndrová was 13 at the time her mother was a photographer who took some of the photographs on display. “My father took me out on to the streets and said: ‘Look at this and remember it forever.’”Later she studied foreign languages, learning French and Russian – much to the irritation of her grandfather, who after 1968 did not want anyone in the family to speak Russian. She ended up travelling to Russia frequently from 1976 onwards, and has released a photography collection about Russia.“The events of 1968 still play a part in the way I think about Russia. Russians always are very friendly when they find out you’re Czech, but it’s better not to talk about history,” she said.In contemporary Russia there is still a denial about what Moscow’s troops did in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968, with all the focus instead on the heroics of the second world war victory. Kyndrová said she had an exhibit planned in Moscow in 2005 called “1945-1968-1989”, exploring the different episodes of Soviet military involvement in Czechoslovakia. “But at the last minute we got a phone call and they asked to rename the exhibit ‘Russian-Czech dialogue’ and take out some of the pictures. I refused.” In Slovakia and the Czech Republic there are those on both the far left and the far right who favour improved relations with Russia and dismiss the historical grievances as irrelevant. “Think of our history with the Germans, and now we are friends,” said Jaroslav Doubrava, 70, a senator and one of the most enthusiastic supporters of modern Russia among Czech politicians.Doubrava had recently returned from a trip to Crimea, organised despite heated protests from the Ukrainian embassy in Prague. He praised Russia for “performing miracles” in the territory.Peter Marček, an independent Slovak MP who had recently made a separate trip to Crimea, said: “To me, August 1968 was the aggression of the communist Soviet Union, not a hostile act of the Russian nation.”Unlike Poland or the Baltic states, the two countries do not have a centuries-long complicated history with Russia. For many ordinary Czechs, Russia is of minimal importance. It may not be deep-seated distrust of Russia rooted in 1968 that is behind the anti-Russian political mood, but recent actions by the Kremlin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f06f2776d56db70b0ae816d04a709f60df56304/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=306863c2128ea1ebe961caf400c22318","title":"separated south and north korean families take part in rare reunions","story":"Families from both sides of the border meet in first reunions to be held for three yearsFamilies from North and South Korea meet today in reunions held for the first time in three years, as relations thaw under a diplomatic push by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.The runions are a reminder of the painful isions that remain more than six decades after the end of the 1950-53 Korean war, and come in the wake of a summit between the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, and Kim in April. On Monday, a convoy of 30 buses rolled across the demilitarised zone, headed for the North Korean tourist resort of Mount Kumgang.About 180 families will be reunited and get to spend about 11 hours together over the course of three days. For many it will likely be the only chance they have to come face-to-face with long lost relatives. Many participants are elderly, with 35 members of the South Korean group older than 90 and the oldest member at 101 years old. Roughly 30 medical staff will accompany the group.“I am very lucky,” Lee Su-nam, who will meet his older brother, said four days before the reunion. Lee had long assumed his brother was killed in the war, but the chance to meet is fraught with political pitfalls.“I think there’s going to be a lot of difference, in the language, in the way of thinking, and the lifestyles we lived,” Lee said. “I can’t ask him what kind of jobs he’s had and the troubles he’s had under the North Korean regime.”The reunions highlight the stark differences that remain between the two countries. South Koreans have prepared gifts for their relatives, often basic necessities such as winter jackets, socks, underwear, medicine, toothpaste and food. Choco Pies, a marshmallow between two pieces of cake and covered in chocolate, are particularly popular in North Korea, and were previously offered as bonuses to workers in joint manufacturing projects.Families are discouraged from giving cash, for fear it may be taken by North Korean authorities, and the South Korean government has told its citizens to politely refuse any gifts with propagandistic overtones."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3601302.1534742990!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"five big take aways from this year s cao results","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn business – another area with strong projected job growth – points remains strong and steady.* Click here to download a PDF of the CAO’s 2018 Round One offers: https:iti.ms2N1opT7This morning more than 50,000 applicants will receive an offer from the CAO on behalf of the 44 institutions who provide their places on courses through this structure. Here’s are some of the big trends from this year’s figures.A fall in applications for arts programmes this year is reflected in a decrease in points requirements across most courses. Maynooth – which is now the biggest programme in the country with 1,400 places – is down 7 to 320, UCC is down 46 to 300, DCU is down 2 to 356, Mary I down 16 to 320 and NUI Galway remains unchanged at 300. Creative arts programmes have plummeted in some cases, while journalism courses are also down significantly.The big talking point, however, is the impact of UCD’s changes to its traditional arts offering . It has replaced its old arts degree with three new streams, which has had a mixed impact on points. Last year, arts at UCD was 326 points. This year, there has been a sharp decline in the number of places from 1,280 to 350 on the course that most resembles the old three-year arts degree. This has pushed points up to 381 – or 50 points more than last year. This is likely to exclude many who were sure of a place.Many other traditional arts subjects have ended up in social science, a new four-year programme where points are at 392. This, also, is set to disappoint many would-be students.By contrast, points for UCD’s new four-year BA humanities course stand at just 301, while points for its social policy (social work) degree are just 291, indicating that many are unsure what to make of the changes.The last of the new BA courses at UCD, modern languages, is down from 464 to 399, a fall of 65. This may be good news for students, but will disappoint many academics and industry figures who have expressed concerns about a shortage of workers with a second language. Students – who grew up during the economic downturn – are opting for courses where they can expect to walk into jobs.Engineering and architecture is in high demand. Engineering in Trinity is up 18 to 488, at UCD it is up 11 to 510, at Maynooth it is up by 50 to 414, and in NUI Galway by 31 to 432. Some engineering courses have bucked the trend such as engineering at UL, which is down 21 to 422, and in UCC, down 11 to 443. Architecture is up six in UCD to 498 and in UCCCIT it is up three to 447. In a related area, construction management is up 20 at DIT to 346. In business – another area with strong projected job growth – points remains strong and steady. Teaching and nursing are also areas where there are skills shortages – so it’s no surprise that they are also in strong demand. Points are up for most primary and secondary teaching courses, even with additional places on offer this year.Many nursing courses also see their points increase. UCD’s children and general nursing is up 10 to 477, while Trinity’s equivalent falls by 11 points to 473. Industry, government and business have placed a huge focus on Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) given projected skills gaps in these areas.While demand is strong for engineering and many science courses, points have fallen for both physics and technology course, which may alarm many in the sector.General science, for the most part, remains steady at UCD, UCC, NUI Galway and DIT. Trinity changed its offering this year, so it’s hard to compare year on year, though points here are high.Degrees in physics-related courses, however, are down considerably in points requirement, despite a decrease in the numbers of places offered. There has been a sharp decrease in points for computer science programmes across the country, even though industry figures say there is a critical skills shortage looming.Points are down 23 in Trinity to 444, 16 in UCC to 403. Computer applications in DCU is down 13 to 377. Computer science with Language in Trinity is also down 93 to 350, while computer technologies in UL is down 12 to 332.Medicine remains hugely popular – and as highly competitive as ever. Points remain steady for medicine at the RSCI (730), Trinity (731), UCD (734), UCC (729) and NUI Galway (725). Points for dentistry, paramedical programmes also remain on high points. CAO points for inidual course are based on supply (the number of places on offer) and demand (the number of applicants). Normally, you would expect points to drop where there is a decrease in application, and vice versa. However, colleges are responding to the change in the pattern of demand among applicants by increasing and decreasing the numbers of places on offer accordingly. As a result, points for some courses may increase – even though demand is falling. This year, colleges reduced the number of places for business, ICT and journalism programmes. By contrast, there were extra places added to programmes such as biological and related sciences."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3601116.1534716467!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how dev almost lost the 1966 presidential election","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTom O’Higgins (top left) hailed from a venerable Fine Gael dynasty and ran an American-style campaign while Seán Lemass was pivotal in reminding voters of Dev’s patriotic credentials. Photographs: The Politics students might be astonished to learn that Éamon de Valera was re-elected for a second seven-year term as Uachtaráin na hÉireann in 1966 without making a single campaign speech.He did not personally canvass for votes, did not engage in debate with his sole opponent, Fine Gael’s Tom O’Higgins, did not comment on the issues and did not even hold a final rally.But Fine Gael leader and future taoiseach Liam Cosgrave insisted there was nothing in the Constitution, written or implied, that indicated an outgoing President could not campaign.As another presidential election looms, comparisons are being made with 1966. This was the last time the incumbent officer holder was challenged when seeking re-election.The practice of politics, the media landscape and societal issues have changed dramatically since the electorate was asked to choose between de Valera and O’Higgins. Yet, there are similarities with the upcoming contest as President Michael D Higgins is set to be opposed for a second term, just as de Valera was then.Higgins has said he will nominate himself in accordance with the Constitution and stand as an Independent candidate.De Valera did not avail of that right in 1966. He agreed to be nominated instead by Fianna Fáil members of the Oireachtas.The question now is will President Higgins stay aloof from electioneering, as Dev did, or will he embrace the hustings with the risk of the presidency being brought into discussion of Government policy?De Valera’s opponent, Tom O’Higgins, was of a Fine Gael dynasty, a TD for Laois-Offaly, a lawyer, a former minister for health and a nephew of Kevin O’Higgins, the minister for justice assassinated in 1927.He toured the country with his wife Terry, addressed 130 public meetings and took part in American-style motorcades with marching bands.Fianna Fáil confidently expected de Valera – the last surviving commandant of the Easter Rising and a towering figure in 20th century Ireland – to be re-elected unopposed in the golden jubilee year of that historic event. The party was furious when Fine Gael opposed him.Dev, who was 84 and with failing eyesight, attended many public events as part of his official presidential duties. But he refrained from making any public comments that might be construed as political.Fianna Fáil ensured, however, that his presence at many of those gatherings had the trappings of his old election rallies. Old IRA veterans, wearing War of Independence service medals, provided guards of honour and party supporters sometimes shouted “up Dev!”He travelled by train to Mallow on May 15th to attend an Easter Rising commemorative pageant with a cast of 2,000 local people at the local racecourse. The Irish Press, which he had founded, assigned two reporters and a photographer to cover the visit.The line between presidential protocol and party politics became blurred. As others formally greeted de Valera as “Uachtaráin” or “Mr President”, the veteran Fianna Fáil TD for Cork North East, Martin Corry, just stepped forward and shook the hand of his old political leader with the salutation, “welcome chief.”Supporters had earlier gathered to greet Dev at each railway station where the train stopped along the route from Dublin. Babies were held up by their parents to see the President, who spoke from the State coach, a special carriage attached to the regular train.The following day, The Irish Press began publishing extracts from his upcoming biography by Lord Longford and T P O’Neill. The series of articles illustrated with photographs from momentous moments in his long career continued over 14 issues until the eve of polling.When the President was driven to Waterford on May 28th for the conferring of the freedom of the city on William Cardinal Conway, bonfires blazed along the route while supporters carried placards, waved flags and escorted him with bands through various towns.Fine Gael, while mainly focusing on the future, did not entirely turn their backs on the past. The O’Higgins campaign began at his ancestral home in Stradbally, Co Laois, where his family’s record of national and public service was invoked.His father, Dr TF O’Higgins, brother Michael, sister-in law Brigid Hogan-O’Higgins and uncle Kevin, had all been elected to the Dáil. His father and uncle had also served as cabinet ministers. One of his great-grandfathers, TD Sullivan, was a Fenian poet and patriot.Fianna Fáil’s campaign seemed to be going well. There was an after glow from the golden jubilee celebrations of the 1916 Rising, many of which were attended by de Valera. But it was a difficult time for the government politically.Farmers were marching for better prices. And there was growing industrial unrest, continuing a pattern from the previous year when 89 disputes resulted in work stoppages by almost 40,000 people.Fianna Fáil, fearing the voters might use the presidential election to send a protest message to the government, conducted a big campaign. Ministers addressed 100 meetings and the party issued 128,000 posters, 120,000 car stickers and two million canvassing cards. It also distributed 1.7 million copies of an election manifesto.There were no significant opinion polls at that time. But the main political parties had a network of members in each parish, who were so tuned into the mood of the electorate it was claimed they could tell how people voted from the way they walked.Fine Gael’s campaign directed by Gerard Sweetnam TD, a formidable organiser, tapped into the changing public mood by highlighting “the need for a youthful, forward looking president to personify the real Ireland and what it can best contribute to modern civilisation”.It too ran a lively campaign during which it distributed more than 1.7 million copies of the O’Higgins manifesto, as well 1.25 million canvassing cards, 157,600 posters and 100,000 lapel badges and car stickers.Speeches by O’Higgins were not reported on radio or television, but normal news coverage was given to events attended by de Valera as Head of State.Fine Gael protested that their candidate was unfairly treated, but RTÉ said it had been following established election coverage practice and had not been subjected to political pressure from any source.O’Higgins, who was just short of his 50th birthday, travelled an estimated 22,000 miles around the country in five weeks, sometimes attending as many as three rallies a night.The new style campaigning was well illustrated when he toured Limerick city in a small red open sports car on May 28th, while a light aircraft flew overhead and dropped balloons with election slogans.But the old ways were not totally abandoned as both sides canvassed door to door and held church-gate meetings. Cattle sales at an open air market in Carndonagh, Co Donegal, on May 2nd were even suspended to hear O’Higgins address the assembled farmers.De Valera was odds-on favourite to win. He was revered by his loyal followers for his national leadership and long service. But the electorate was changing. Many of the old values he had espoused were being questioned as a new generation looked more to the future than the past.Nowhere were the changes more apparent than in the new ballrooms where the Royal Showband, the Dixies and the Miami were attracting large numbers of young dancers more interested in The Hucklebuck than the Siege of Ennis.Lemass assured the electorate, however, that de Valera’s re-election would be “an affirmation by the people that the aims for our country which have directed him throughout his life remain constant, and that patriotism is as relevant in the island of 1966 as it was in 1916”.But there were worrying signs for Fianna Fáil. The perceptive  political writer John Healy sensed early in the campaign that something was happening: “The Fine Gael tail is up. It is running as it has not run for a long time. It will be an interesting finish indeed.”He noted that O’Higgins, and his wife, ran the gauntlet of the aisles twice at a special ardfheis in Dublin’s Mansion House and were given two standing ovations, one before lunch and one after. The first lasted 54 seconds, the second 46.Fianna Fáil campaign director Charles Haughey, then minister for agriculture, was worried by the grassroots feedback. He called for an all-out effort by party workers on polling day to ensure de Valera would win.He also went into the Dáil five days before voting to announce a £5.5 million package of measures to boost farm income. The aid was expected but farm leaders believed the timing had to do with the campaign.Both parties mobilised thousands of cars to transport voters to and from the polling booths which were open for 13 hours in 38 constituencies with 6,200 presiding officers and clerks on duty.But glorious weather meant many people went to the seaside instead. And there were also some hints of political apathy. A sign on a wall in Kingsbridge, Dublin, read: “Arkle for President.”The turnout was 64.7 per cent, which meant 602,585 people, one-third of the 1.7 million electorate, did not vote. De Valera had just 10,617 votes to spare over O’Higgins (558,861 to 548,144), a margin of less than 1 per cent.The President said he was glad to have won his last race, “even though it was only by a short head” and explained why he had not nominated himself.It would have been mere pretence to do so, he said, noting that no person could hope to win a presidential election without the support of some organisation or party.Lemass regarded the result solely as “a tribute to a man who had given exceptional national service and an indication of the people’s confidence to fulfil the duties of the presidency in a manner which will do credit to our nation”.O’Higgins, who later became a High Court judge, a judge of the European Court of Justice and Chief Justice, wrote in his autobiography A Double Life that he felt he had acquitted himself well and had come out of the contest with his integrity intact.“The description ‘a close run thing’ used by the Duke of Wellington to describe his famous victory at Waterloo, might well have been applied also to the result of the Presidential election in Ireland in 1966,” he wrote.Fine Gael claimed a moral victory and a vote of no confidence in the government. But their supporters were tantalised by the thought of what might have been – just one extra vote in every ballot box for O’Higgins would have elected him president and caused a seismic political shock."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

And she said she was singing to not feel cold in the sea overnight.She climbed the ladder to board the Croatian Coast Guard ship Cavtat herself, after spending ten hours in the seaMs Longstaff, who now lives on the Costa del Sol, was found swimming less than a mile from the point where she disappeared from the Norwegian Star as it made its way to Venice. She looked relaxed and happy, wearing a T-shirt tied in a knot and blue denim shorts as she reached the Croatian city of Pula on Sunday morning.It is not clear how Ms Longstaff came to be in the water, but said she fell off the back of the ship. She told waiting reporters: I fell off the back of the Norwegian Star and I was in the water for about 10 hours. These wonderful guys rescued me.Ms Longstaff said she was sitting at the back of the deck before the incident happened, adding: I am very lucky to be alive. Kay pictured with her rescuers from the Croatian Coast GuardShe is believed to have fallen into the Adriatic from the 965ft cruise liner just before midnight on Saturday around 60 miles south of Pula. The ship alerted the authorities who dispatched the Croatian Coast Guard patrol ship Cavtat and a PC-9 search plane to search for her throughout the night. Three other ships were also involved. She was eventually found at around 9.30am on Sunday swimming less than a mile from where she disappeared.The rescue ship\u0027s captain Lovro Oreskovic said: The British woman was exhausted when we pulled her out of the water. We were extremely happy for saving a human life.He said that he proud of his crew, particularly rescue swimmer Lieutenant Colonel Marina Delić who had pulled her from the water. It is understood that Ms Longstaff has now been released from hospital and is due to be reunited with her family. British woman rescued from Adriatic SeaDavid Radas, a spokesman from Croatian Ministry of Maritime Affairs, told The : After they found her the rescued woman was not injured, just exhausted, hypothermical and in shock. When they reached the coast she felt pretty much recovered. That was also confirmed the hospital staff after they conducted preliminary health check.He said that by checking CCTV rescuers knew the exact moment Ms Longstaff fell in the water.Mr Radas said: Because they knew the time, they were able to know the exact position of the ship.A Norwegian Star spokeswoman said: We are pleased to advise that the guest was found alive, is currently in stable condition, and has been taken ashore in Croatia for further treatment. We are very happy that the inidual, who is a UK resident, is now safe and will soon be reunited with friends and family.The Croatian Coast Guard rescued the womanAn official at the hospital where she was taken confirmed: The British woman was brought to the hospital and her life is not endangered.Staff at the cruise liner are said to be examining the CCTV cameras to try an establish exactly what happened to the woman. The Norwegian Star was sailing from Vargarola to Venice when the incident happened.

In the movie, Stallworth\u0026nbsp(played by\u0026nbspJohn David Washington) manages to prevent a bomb going off at a civil rights rally, making him\u0026nbspa hero on the\u0026nbsppolice force.\u0026nbspHowever, Riley claims the event – along with may other things depicted on screen – was created for the adaptation in order to ender the audience more towards the police. “It’s a made up story in which the false parts of it try to make a cop the protagonist in the fight against racial oppression,” he\u0026nbspwrites.Riley’s alleges\u0026nbspthat Stallworth\u0026nbspwas part of\u0026nbspCOINTELPRO, a series of covert and often illegal operations\u0026nbspconducted by the FBI to disrupt political organisations, and\u0026nbsp“infiltrated a Black radical organisation for three\u0026nbspyears” to\u0026nbsp”sabotage” a group who stood against racist oppression. He\u0026nbspargues that a\u0026nbspFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) proves this and\u0026nbspthat the operations Stallworth took part in\u0026nbspworked against\u0026nbspblack causes.\u0026nbsp“Without the made up stuff and with what we know of the actual history of police infiltration into radical groups, and how they infiltrated and directed White Supremacist organisations to attack those groups, Ron Stallworth is the villain,” Riley writes.\u0026nbsp25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and Watson“To the extent that people of colour deal with actual physical attacks and terrorising due to racism and racist doctrines — we deal with it mostly from the police on a day to day basis. And not just from White cops. From Black cops too. So for Spike to come out with a movie where a story points are fabricated in order make Black cop and his counterparts look like allies in the fight against racism is really disappointing, to put it very mildly.”Riley finishes the essay by pointing out that Lee was allegedly paid $200,000 by the New York Police department to direct an advertising campaign to improve their image with minority communities.\u0026nbsp“Whether it actually is or not, Blackkklansman feels like an extension of that ad campaign,” he concludes.\u0026nbspLee has yet to comment on Riley’s essay.Sorry to Bother YouEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/14/16/madonna-career-21.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6463721  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= 1984  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/14/16/madonna-career-21.jpg","title":"madonna 60 pop stars middle age patti smith kate bush","story":"Created with Sketch.In most\u0026nbspprofessions,\u0026nbspwomen of a certain age are invisible.

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2016/03/24/17/36-big-read-2-afpget.jpg","title":"prague spring anniversary czechoslovakia soviet union wwii czech republic slovakia","story":"Created with Sketch.A programme of liberalisation was met with 2,000 Soviet tanks and 250,000 soldiers on the streetsClick to followThe Independent OnlineSoviet tanks arrive to crush the ‘Prague Spring’Fifty years ago this week, on 21 August 1968, the citizens of Prague awoke to find tanks on their streets. For some it came as no surprise. Student activist Pavel Kamenicky was sleeping. “At first I thought it was the university bus trying to find the right gear,” he says. “But I realised it was way too loud. I jumped up thinking, ‘they’ve come’.”Czechoslovakia had dominated news bulletins throughout the summer after its premier, First Secretary Alexander Dubcek, had begun reforming his communist government’s structures earlier that year. But now, what had become known as the Prague Spring, or Dubcek’s “socialism with a human face”, was lying crushed beneath the tank tracks in Wenceslas Square.The Soviet Union feared its grip on the satellite states of eastern Europe was loosening and its patience had finally run out. Czechoslovakia and Dubcek had fallen foul of USSR leader\u0026nbspLeonid Brezhnev’s eponymous doctrine, espoused retroactively in justification the month after Warsaw Pact troops took to Prague’s streets: “When forces that are hostile to socialism try to turn the development of some socialist country towards capitalism, it becomes not only a problem of the country concerned, but a common problem and concern of all socialist countries,” Brezhnev saidSoviet forces, alongside those of Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria, crossed the Czechoslovakian border at 11pm on the evening of 20 August. East Germany withdrew at the last minute when it was realised that, just over two decades after the end of the Second World War, the presence of German troops on Czech and Slovak soil could lead to unintended repercussions. The following morning, the foreign soldiers were in the capital, offering fraternal support to loyal comrades in Czechoslovakia.Soviet tanks had intervened in post-war eastern Europe before. Towards the end of October in 1956, Hungarians revolted against their Marxist-Leninist government and declared a new administration, withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact and disbanding the communist-run state security apparatus. But barely two and half weeks later the western world watched aghast, but impotent, as Soviet forces entered Budapest to restore one-party rule.Yet there had been real hope that Czechoslovakia could be different. 1968 was, of course, a year of revolution and political protest across the\u0026nbspplanet. But the Czechoslovak version was in many ways a rather gentler form of dissent. Dubcek had never set out to overthrow communism, merely to reform it.The nation’s planned economy had been in decline throughout the 1960s. Dubcek had replaced previous first secretary,\u0026nbspAntonín Novotný, in January 1968 and had attempted to liberalise communist party rule by tolerating political institutions and organisations not directly controlled by the party. Even multi-party government was mooted. More repressive laws were loosened, travel was made easier and freedom of expression, especially in media, accepted.Unwittingly though, Dubcek had created either a vicious or a virtuous circle, depending on one’s political viewpoint. Reform emboldened progressives and led to demand for further liberalisation. Dissidents, especially students, but also the wider population in numerous Soviet satellite nations, began to push for similar freedoms.Conversely, communist hardliners in Czechoslovakia and other Soviet client states feared a loss of power and urged Dubcek to pause. Brezhnev and the Soviet politburo were starting to take notice. Yet in meetings with Soviet leaders Dubcek believed he had convinced them of his loyalty to the communist cause and that his domestic reforms were not challenging the hegemony.He was wrong: 2,000 tanks and a 250,000-strong Soviet-led force of men invaded on Brezhnev’s orders 137 Czechoslovak civilians were killed resisting and, pleading with his citizens not to fight back, Dubcek was flown to Moscow.Some citizens used the power of argument to voice their opposition, engaging troops in discussion to make their point – until photographs were used in Soviet propaganda to suggest the locals were making friends with the invaders. Dubcek returned as little more than a puppet of the Soviet regime and was replaced early in 1969. Half a million of his supporters were expelled from the Communist Party.AFPGetty)The members of Nato, especially the United States – already involved in conflict in Vietnam and aiming to broker a disarmament agreement with the Soviet Union – condemned the invasion but had no intention of intervening. In the aftermath, 300,000 Czechoslovaks, many highly qualified, emigrated to the west, although the authorities soon clamped down on their ability to leave.The period between 1969 and 1971 is known in Czechoslovak history as the era of “normalisation”. The country returned to the Soviet fold opposition both within and without the country faded and the Communist Party returned to the hardline position it had held before the onset of the Prague Spring.So, 50 years later, what does the anniversary offer today’s Europeans\u0026nbspstill struggling with political upheaval and, certainly in the east of the continent, getting to grips with increasingly nationalistic, repressive governments? Apart from the sense of betrayal felt by Czechs and Slovaks, both towards their own government and their supposed allies, and the reminder that totalitarianism brooks no dissent, are there lessons to be learned from the Prague Spring and what became of Dubcek, its architect? Unsurprisingly the legacy is complex – as legacies are wont to be.Perhaps the key to understanding Czechoslovakia in 1968 is that, unlike similar uprisings against the establishment, both in communist Europe but also elsewhere around the world – witness the Arab Spring of 2010 and 2011 – the Prague Spring was not a movement of only liberals, students (among other young people) and political intellectuals fighting a conservative establishment. It had wider cross-generational support drawing on the strong traditions of democracy that had developed in Czechoslovakia between the two world wars, after its formation in 1918.Czech-born writer Milan Kundera, author of the Unbearable Lightness of Being, who lived in exile in France from 1975, argued that it was a movement falling back on the “best traditions” of Czechoslovakia’s brief history: a “higher quality of democracy not based on the ills associated with capitalism”. By contrast, the later revolutions that would finally overthrow communism in Europe at the end of the 1980s were driven as much by the “victory” of Reaganism, free-market economics and monetarism as they were by the right to vote freely and express opinions openly.It has become fashionable, with hindsight, to blame the suppression of the Prague Spring on “communism”. But let it not be forgotten that it was fervent communists who were carrying out Czechoslovakia’s reforms. Whether the Prague Spring was a “purer” revolution than those that followed is probably an argument for political ideologues alone, but a glance across the border towards Viktor Orban’s Hungary shows that the spoils of the “freedom” won in 1989 might not always manifest themselves with good intent.Two decades after Dubcek’s attempt to reform communism from within, the then premier of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, issued an apology on behalf of all Warsaw Pact nations, stating that the invasion of Czechoslovakia was a mistake, and that the USSR should never have interfered in the internal affairs of another sovereign state. (It should be noted that both Romania and Albania had refused to participate in the 1968 intervention and Albania ultimately withdrew from the Warsaw Pact in the aftermath.)It was the culmination of a number of apologies from Warsaw Pact nations throughout 1989 and it seems reasonable to argue that there was a direct link between these acknowledgements and the overthrow of communist governments in East Germany, Poland, Romania and, most poignantly, Czechoslovakia, that same year. Protesters realised that their actions would no longer lead to Red Army interference, and the Soviet bloc of eastern European nations had replaced their communist rulers within months of one another.Vaclav Havel, in 1989,\u0026nbspwas elected first president of\u0026nbspCzechoslovakia as communist crumbled across Eastern Europe\u0026nbsp(Getty)Perhaps 1968 showed us, if 1956 had not already, that the post-war façade of communist interdependence, internationalism and fraternal allegiance was broken, if indeed it had ever been more than a charade at all. The alliance was built on flimsy foundations and maintained by suppression. Czech historical novelist and writer Ivan Klíma has said that – for good or ill – the most important legacy of the Prague Spring was the delayed but ultimate destruction of the international communist movement.But warnings must still be heeded. In a world where a nationalistically invigorated Russia under Vladimir Putin increasingly looks beyond its borders for a bulwark against Nato and the EU, the demise of communism and the Warsaw Pact does not mean a concurrent diminishing of militarism: the annexation of Crimea by Russia has shown us that very clearly. And – even putting aside the Brexit debate – illiberal governments in Slovakia, Poland and Hungary threaten to overturn the European Union’s free-market liberal consensus. The threat, while changed in ideology, still lurks.And what of Dubcek? After he was ousted as\u0026nbsp first secretary he worked for the forestry service near Bratislava, in his native Slovakia. And after the final overthrow of communist rule in Czechoslovakia’s Velvet Revolution of 1989 he briefly returned to political prominence as chairman\u0026nbspof the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly, and later as leader of the Slovak Social Democrats.He ides those of his compatriots who thought he was a decent man wronged and those who think he was naïve.Pavel Kamenicky, now 70, says: “We were idealistic. But Dubcek should have realised what was going to happen. Did he really think Brezhnev would shrug and say ‘carry on’?” On the other hand, Dubcek’s son Pavol has defended his father’s position, once saying: “I don’t know if people really understand what it meant to have your fate in Brezhnev’s hands.”For right or wrong, however, Dubcek had in truth become more or less a political irrelevance by the time of the Velvet Revolution. Václav Havel, the poet and statesman who played a prominent role in the events of 1989 and became Czechoslovakia’s first post-Soviet era president, said: “Dubcek is a symbol of our nice memories, but nobody thinks he can influence the situation now.” Dubcek himself rarely spoke of 1968.Although a Slovak, Dubcek was opposed to the 1993 split between the Czech Republic and Slovakia and maintained his belief in the idea of a single, united nation. He was killed in a car crash in 1992, declared in an official investigation to be an accident. Conspiracy theories abound and even today 50 per cent of those Slovaks who know of him believe his death was almost certainly not an accident.The crushing of the Prague Spring continues to echo down the ages, its eventual legacy yet to be determined.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/16/south-africa-school.jpg","title":"south africa corruption president ramaphosa mabuza zuma anc","story":"Created with Sketch.The ruling African National Congress pledges education and opportunity\u0026nbspfor black people\u0026nbsp– but embezzlement in the\u0026nbspdeputy president’s province has left schools so decrepit that children plunge to their death in toiletsClick to followThe Independent OnlineSchool at Orange Farm, near Soweto: one of the ANC’s policies is to improve education for black South African childrenZiyanda\u0026nbspNkosi hated going to the bathroom at school. The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the little girl, a six-year-old first-grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.“Mommy! Mommy!” she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former maths teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress (ANC) and was positioning himself to become South Africa’s deputy president.One of the party’s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. ANC leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school\u0026nbspand Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the ANC the education system has been a\u0026nbspshambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda’s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local ANC leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents –\u0026nbspand for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the ANC tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire ANC, launching him into an even more prominent post\u0026nbspas South Africa’s deputy president, second only to the nation’s leader.Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the ANC is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mandela’s legacy. After all, Mabuza’s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country’s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mabuza’s spectacular climb, current and former ANC officials say: he siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.Mabuza (second right) (AFPGetty)“He didn’t become what he is now because of his political capability,” says\u0026nbspFish Mahlalela, a senior ANC figure in the province and a national lawmaker.“No, no, it was out of money and\u0026nbspmanipulation,” he adds. “Nothing else.”Perhaps more than any other member of South Africa’s new government, Mabuza undercuts the promise of a “new dawn” in the country after the removal of President Jacob Zuma this year.Besieged by scandals that have hacked away at the ANC’s legitimacy and electoral prospects, the party installed a new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in February. From the start, he pledged to root out corruption and finally deliver on the promise of a just South Africa for all of its citizens.But to seal his new post, Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa’s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country’s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the “tragedies that take away the innocence of our children”. He spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a five-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of faeces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolising the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.“Where is our care?” Mabuza said in the speech. “What has gone wrong with our nation?”Yet under Mabuza’s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required\u0026nbspand school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mabuza’s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to ANC officials, high-ranking defectors and anti-corruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled\u0026nbspfor unexplained reasons\u0026nbspto $30m (£23m) each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mabuza’s province also became known as one of South Africa’s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the ANC, were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while\u0026nbspMabuza’s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new ANC members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the ANC’s second biggest voting bloc. Under the party’s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria\u0026nbspwith a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mabuza’s role as the country’s second most powerful politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its assertions that the ANC is turning the page on corruption.Under the ANC, Mandela’s once-heralded liberation movement, tens of billions of dollars meant to lift poor black South Africans have been stolen by party leaders. Strong institutions like the tax agency have been hollowed out by party officials bent on shielding their illicit activities.But the nation’s poor schools are perhaps the ANC’s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans – some of whom have turned to burning down such institutions in protest.Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Ramaphosa’s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: the new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration’s future – as well as the country’s – rests in the hands of Mabuza.“If there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa’s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,” says\u0026nbspRalph Mathekga, the author of Ramaphosa’s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?“We are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,” he adds. “If Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.”Scandal from the startThe numbers just didn’t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mabuza got his first big break: he became Mpumalanga’s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect resume. The son of farmers, Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalls\u0026nbspReginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.“He was never late,” says\u0026nbspMhaule, a longtime ally who recently became one of South Africa’s two deputy foreign ministers.A bright student, Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught maths at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers’ association.Poor schooling was a major spark in the anti-apartheid movement, most notably in Soweto in 1976, when thousands of students protested the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Mabuza’s province, teachers and students began organising against white minority rule in the early 1980s.The teachers were at the centre\u0026nbspof the movement, says\u0026nbspSandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mabuza into the main student organisation. Mabuza quickly stood out, he says, travelling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)“He was a leader in his own right,” Sukati says.But after apartheid ended, Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province’s first big scandal of the democratic era.\u0026nbspIn 1997, three years into his tenure as education minister, the schools were performing poorly, especially on the national obsession: the annual matriculation exams that determine whether students graduate from high school. The passing rate in his province was 46 per cent that year, slightly below the national average.Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful ANC leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former ANC officials say.Sukati, who worked under Mabuza at the education department, recalls Mabuza\u0026nbsptelling some of the teachers: “I am in a tight situation.”\u0026nbspThe next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 per cent – an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to second place\u0026nbspamong the nation’s nine provinces.“I was suspicious,” says\u0026nbspSukati, who is now a senior education official. “It couldn’t just happen like that.”A whistleblower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, authorities announced, was under 53 per cent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mabuza’s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired.An investigation was never completed. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mabuza’s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the ANC across South Africa..“I think\u0026nbspthe man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don’t know what went wrong,” says\u0026nbspRonnie Malomane, an ANC official who was taught maths by Mabuza in the early 1980s. “They were just giving him position after position.”Nationally, Mabuza’s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move – called the “Rapid Implementation Unit” – as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.“That’s how he managed to loot,” says\u0026nbspCollen Sedibe, a former ANC leader who grew up on the same street as Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures “incurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier”.But parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.‘They wanted to kill me’It took four days of rage before the local ANC councillor showed up.The councillor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: he is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.By the time he got to Ziyanda’s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the ANC’s leaders.Siboza made sure to bring a gun. Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he says.The ANC has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the ANC as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several ANC officials say, Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the ANC ensures its dominance.But Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mabuza, rejects\u0026nbspany suggestion that the ANC had failed to prioritise education.Officials like Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Siboza, the local ANC councillor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.“They wanted to kill me,” the councillor says.Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun – firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. “This man is a church member,” he says.A few days later, the ANC councillor visited the children he had wounded.“The councillor said he was very sorry,” says\u0026nbspthe girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councillor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she says. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy’s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councillor, about $150.The boy’s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplores\u0026nbspthe state of education.“They promise,” she says, “and they just disappear.”Still, she would remain loyal to the governing party.“Yes, of course, I vote ANC,” she says. “It’s our freedom.”‘He always had money in his house’The protests spilled into September, but the country’s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Zuma as South Africa’s president.The all-important ANC party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mabuza’s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the ANC released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mabuza: his previously low-ranking province was now the ANC’s second most powerful.Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, ANC membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 per cent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 per cent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga’s explosive growth.But Mabuza’s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former ANC officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money – with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that “irregular expenditures” more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, ANC officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students’ expense.Thousands in Israel protest draft law that would ‘exclude’ ArabsGrenfell victims were subject to ‘social apartheid’, says Diane AbbottSouth Africa is the most unequal country in the world, says World BankMandela’s letters chart his heartbreaking struggle from behind barsAs premier, Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega-schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11m to around $30m.Asked whether Mabuza wanted the mega-schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Mhaule, his former education minister, laughs\u0026nbspand says:\u0026nbsp“I don’t know.”But other officials say the mega-schools were overpriced projects to reward Mabuza’s allies and finance his ANC membership drive.Mabuza\u0026nbspwas sworn in as deputy president in February. “His passion,” reads his official biography, “still remains in education.”Minutes after the swearing-in, he faced questions about corruption and political killings in his province. “There’s nothing to set straight,” he told the national public broadcaster.“I’m here to serve South Africans,” he added. “Let’s give this government a chance.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/19/17/Karla-Thresher.jpg","title":"lifeboat woman first female minehead somerset rnli","story":"Created with Sketch.Healthcare worker\u0026nbspKarla Thresher had to lead first emergency call as she prepared for final assessmentClick to followThe Independent OnlineMs Thresher reinforced a family link with Minehead station, where her great-uncle Harold Bushen skippered a lifeboat 50 years ago A woman has taken charge of a lifeboat for the first time in her station\u0027s 117-year history.Karla Thresher, 28, has passed her exams to skipper the Minehead D class lifeboat.The healthcare worker has already led her first emergency call to rescue two boys cut off by the tide off the north Somerset coast.Ms Thresher had been preparing for her final assessment when the lifeboat station received the call to rescue the boys three miles away at Blue Anchor.She found herself in charge of the D class boat and speeding to the scene with her RNLI assessor and fellow crew member Phil Sanderson aboard.The two boys managed to scramble back to the beach safely and two hours later Ms Thresher was passed out to become a D class helm.Her promotion comes 12 years after she first signed up as a member of the shore crew and follows 18 months of intensive training, including a week spent at the RNLI College in Poole.It also reinforces a long-standing family link with the Minehead station as her great-uncle, Harold Bushen, was coxswain 50 years ago.Her success means she will now be called on day or night to lead rescue missions anywhere between Hinkley Point and Lynmouth in the five-metre, 25-knot inflatable D class - regarded as the workhorse of the RNLI\u0027s fleet.And in theory she could at any time find herself in charge of an all-female team as Ms Thresher is one of five women crew members at the station.UK news in picturesManchester United women\u0027s side walk out alongside Liverpool ahead of their first professional game since 2005.

but the rain isn\u0027t over yetClick to followThe Independent OnlineUK weather: Sun to return to Britain but will bring sticky and muggy temperaturesBritain will bask in temperatures of up to 28C this week as the warm weather returns following a weekend of wind and rain brought on by tropical storm Ernesto.The sun will break through as early as Sunday afternoon – with the mercury soaring once more, the Met Office says.But moisture blown in off the Atlantic will create a sticky, muggy and humid atmosphere.“Breaks in the cloud will develop leaving a warm and bright afternoon,” forecaster Craig Snell told The Independent. “The south and southeast will see the best of this with temperatures reaching 24C or 25C in London but the north, much of Scotland and Northern Ireland will also feel warm, reaching the low 20s especially in the east.”Temperatures will stay high into the evening – in the late teens – creating another close night.“By Monday and Tuesday, Ernesto has completely gone and we should be seeing less clouds and more blue skies,” said Mr Snell. “There will be a few spits and spots of rain, mainly on higher ground – the Welsh mountains and the Lake District, for instance – but overall, it will be fine and bright with temperatures reaching 26C and 27C in the southeast and perhaps East Anglia.”A potential 28C is a slight but real possibility.He added Wednesday will then be a turning point with a weather front moving southeast from northwest Scotland: “Ahead of the front it will stay largely fine – with London again possibly seeing temperatures of 27C – but as the front passes down, it will bring rain and some wind, leaving a far fresher, cooler feel once it has passed by Thursday.”In its aftermath, Friday will see scattered showers across the country, he added.Historic sites across UK exposed by heatwaveCrop marks show of the old garden at Gawthorpe Hall, LancashireGarden at Gawthorpe Hall, Lancashire which was taken out in the 1940\u0027s but can now be seen again through the parched grassRemnants of WWII Air raid shelters on Jesus Green in Cambridge show up in the parched grassOld crop marks in Norfolk show upInfo showing how crop marks are madeOld parts of RAF Lasham\u0027s airfield show up in the parched grass in HampshireCrop marks show in Tregaron, WalesRemnants of Caistor Roman town in NorfolkPenllwyn Roman fort in Ceregigion, WalesCrop marks show in Tregaron, WalesOld parts of RAF Lasham\u0027s airfield Old crop marks in Norfolk Cross Oak hill fort in Talybont, Wales Crop marks show of the old garden at Gawthorpe Hall, LancashireGarden at Gawthorpe Hall, Lancashire which was taken out in the 1940\u0027s but can now be seen again through the parched grassRemnants of WWII Air raid shelters on Jesus Green in Cambridge show up in the parched grassOld crop marks in Norfolk show upInfo showing how crop marks are madeOld parts of RAF Lasham\u0027s airfield show up in the parched grass in HampshireCrop marks show in Tregaron, WalesRemnants of Caistor Roman town in NorfolkPenllwyn Roman fort in Ceregigion, WalesCrop marks show in Tregaron, WalesOld parts of RAF Lasham\u0027s airfield Old crop marks in Norfolk Cross Oak hill fort in Talybont, Wales The bank holiday weekend will remain changeable for most of the country, although the more pleasant weather will be in the south and southeast.“It’s still a little too early to predict with any real accuracy,” said Mr Snell.Many parts of Britain have enjoyed a long heatwave this summer, with temperatures upwards of 30C regularly recorded.Some areas in the southeast did not see rainfall for more than a month, while in late July, the mercury crept close to the national record of 38.5C recorded in Faversham, Kent in 2003.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/16/14/food-handour.hpg-.jpg","title":"workers jobs food banks money afford cost living","story":"Created with Sketch.Growing number of people forced to choose between rent and food as cost of living continues to soarClick to followThe Independent OnlinePeople of all ages and ethnicities rely on food handoutsDuring rush hour on one of London’s most affluent streets, amid the bustle of the Strand, an orderly queue is forming. Dozens of people stand patiently, and hungrily, waiting for their dinner.The gathering, near\u0026nbspCharing Cross station, comprises people of all ages and ethnicities. Some look visibly homeless, clutching large carrier bags containing their worldly possessions. Others wear work clothes. Despite having a job, they can’t afford to eat.Piles of food packages await under a pink gazebo. As volunteers hand them out, bread and pastries are scoffed into hungry mouths.

Well-dressed couples cut through the snaking queue on their way to the theatre. “It’s a disgrace!” shrills one woman wearing a large pearl necklace as she and her husband saunter away.Toney Kane is a 39-year-old mother-of-three who comes to the handout every week. She explains she\u0026nbsphas spent five of the past eight years homeless with her children, who are now in their 20s. They came to London from Hull after she found herself trapped in an abusive relationship.“We were supposed to move in with family in Woking, but they left us stuck at King’s Cross station. We had to stay on the streets. When we first came, people used to rob off us. In the winter the snow would just come down on us. Nobody would help.”Ms Kane and her children were on the streets for nearly three years before they were given a council flat. They were then evicted because she complained, at which point they became homeless again. She is now in another flat, but says she is in the process of being evicted again.“If you sit down and beg, yeah you do get given food, but it’s not going to be every day,” she says. “That’s why this place is so important.”Emmanouil\u0026nbspGrammatikopoulos, 38, smiles gratefully as he is handed a food parcel. He has been sleeping rough in London for nearly two years, after leaving Greece in the wake of the financial crash. He\u0026nbsptakes construction jobs and sends money home to his wife and baby daughter. His wife\u0026nbspdoesn’t know he is homeless.“I cannot pay to rent in London. It’s very expensive – even one room. If I pay for a room here in London, I cannot pay the rent for my wife and three-year-old daughter at home. I must give the money to them,” he explains.“I could make only 25 euros a day in Greece after the crash, so I came here. I work all the time, for construction agencies. They pay me so I try to do my best.“When you sleep in the streets and you have to wake up at\u0026nbsp6am\u0026nbspto go to your job, it’s a little hard. When you finish you don’t have a place to have a shower. You don’t rest properly to be ready for the next day. But I can do it for now. I’m grateful for that because I have work.”Walking away from the gazebo, another EU national, who didn’t want to give his name, grips a paper cup of steaming tea with a plastic bag of newly retrieved food hanging from his wrist. He looks smart in a sky blue shirt, navy trousers and black shoes, and laughs when asked if he is homeless.“No, I have a room, but I share with three other people,” he says, explaining his bedroom is where three other men sleep. He pays £60 per week for rent. “Yes, I work. But\u0026nbspthis is what I\u0026nbspcan afford.”Richard, 62, is smartly dressed in a white shirt that matches the colour of his bristly beard. He is well spoken and well-versed in the political\u0026nbsprhetoric on homelessness. You wouldn’t expect him to be rough sleeping.A pensioner\u0026nbspwho used to work\u0026nbspin the operating department of a hospital, he is living off his NHS pension of just £350 a month. When his mother died two years ago, his life fell apart and he got evicted from his flat.“I’ve been homeless for a year. It’s not easy, especially when the\u0026nbspweather gets bad,” he says.\u0026nbsp”Washing and showering can be really difficult. But how can I ever get a deposit? The rents are so expensive. The landlords can charge what they want.”Chatting jovially to people as they wait in the queue is Steven Stuart, founder of the Friends of Essex and London Homeless charity, which provides the\u0026nbspfood handouts in the same spot every Wednesday evening.“When we first started we had about 30 or 40 people each time, now we have anywhere between 150 and 250. It’s an opportunity for people to get some food, so that they can still pay that bill to have somewhere to live,” he says.“We find that people are not homeless as we know it. A lot of people are homeless and working. We get Deliveroo drivers quite a lot. There’s a road sweeper who picks up the rubbish who comes along sometimes.

That is why my trade union, Community, is backing\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Final Say\u0026nbspcampaign, to secure a people’s vote on the final deal.”Contribute to the march of a generationAt the last People’s Vote March in June, well over 100,000 people marched on parliament.Community’s roots are in textile manufacturing and the steel industry – pushed to the brink of collapse in recent years as much larger economies such as China distort international markets.In 2018 the industry has faced new pressure in particular from steel tariffs imposed by Donald Trump’s US administration, which Brexiteers are relying on for a favourable future trade deal.Community also supports prison and justice workers, logistics, finance, politics and public affairs staff, the charity and freelance sectors and is affiliated to the Labour\u0026nbspParty.Mr Rickhuss highlighted London School of Economics data concluding Brexit was already costing the average UK household more than £404 a year by June 2017.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline

“profoundly different to those presented in 2016”, branding the promise of £350m a week for the NHS “worthless” and the guarantee that European trade would not be harmed as “at best a mistake, and at worst a deliberate lie.”The general secretary added: “When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is\u0026nbspgood enough.When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is good enough.\u0026nbsp If that outcome is rejected, then all options should be on the table“If that outcome is rejected, then all options should be on the table, including reopening negotiations with Europe and retaining the status quo.“Community would not shy away from asking our members to vote on important or difficult issues in the workplace our politicians must do the right thing and give the people a Final Say on their future.”The People’s Vote launched in April demanding a referendum on the deal agreed with the EU\u0026nbspand has a grassroots network of around 1 million people, holding rallies and action days across the country.The Independent launched its own Final Say campaign three weeks ago,\u0026nbspso far gathering 615,000 names to its petition along with a string of political endorsements.In June this year more than 100,000 people from all walks of life marched on parliament to demand their democratic voice be heard in a new Brexit referendum.But following the newly forged alliance, the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future, on Saturday 20 October\u0026nbspin London, is set to be much larger.Ireland is closer than ever to unification because of BrexitWhy hasn’t the NHS been prioritised in

gathering, with young people whose voices were not heard two years ago at its forefront, will constitute one of the most significant demonstrations in British history – just as Ms May returns from Brussels from a critical Brexit summit.Amatey Doku, vice-president of the 7\u0026nbspmillion-strong National Union of Students and a supporter of the For our Future’s Sake group that backs a new referendum, said: “This Tory government, unfortunately assisted by the Labour Party,\u0026nbspthreaten to harm young people’s futures.Rees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011“That’s why students across the country are coming together for the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future. Students and young people can no longer be ignored – and on 20 October, we won’t be.”The prime minister had once aimed to have a deal agreed with Europe earlier this summer, but with negotiations badly stalling and a major cabinet fallout, expectations turned to the October summit.British ministers privately admit it is now unlikely the UK will be able to agree a deal even by October, with a special summit potentially needed before Christmas – leaving just three months in the new year for the UK and the EU to ratify any agreement.It is also unclear if Ms May will be able to navigate any deal across her party’s deep isions, with the European Research Group of backbench Tory MPs drawing up alternative proposals highlighting the benefits of a no-deal Brexit.An exclusive poll carried out by BMG Research this week found that 48 per cent of the public would now back a vote on any deal struck between the UK and the EU – up from 44 per cent just four weeks ago.Just 24 per cent opposed the idea, down three points over the same period. Only 14 per cent of the 1,500 people surveyed supported Ms May’s chequers deal given a choice.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/07/16/lombok-earthquake-9.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6447456  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/07/16/lombok-earthquake-9.jpg","title":"indonesia earthquake lombok island second magnitude","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followThe Independent OnlineIndonesia\u0027s Lombok island hit by 6.9 magnitude earthquake hours after earlier quakeLombok in Indonesia has been hit by another series of earthquakes - including a major 6.9 magnitude quake - which left one person dead and caused others to run out into the streets in panic.The latest tremors arrived two weeks after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake killed 460 people on the island and caused damage worth more than 5 trillion rupiah (£268 million).Video shot by the Indonesian Red Cross showed huge clouds of dust billowing from landslides on the slopes of Mount\u0026nbspRinjani\u0026nbspin the northeast.Power outages were reported to have left parts\u0026nbspof Lombok\u0026nbspin pitch black conditions.\u0026nbspLombok struck by 6.3 magnitude earthquakeTornado hits refugee camp for survivors of Lombok earthquakeVideo captures the moment Indonesia is struck by powerful earthquakeMan pulled alive from rubble of mosque after Lombok earthquakeI was in a restaurant when the shaking started.

For many women and their partners, a miscarriage means the loss of a baby and the hopes and the dreams for that child,” she told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“It would give people the time out you need when you have been bereaved. It acknowledges a miscarriage is a significant event and this is even true for people who don’t take the leave.”She said the discussion the proposed bill had provoked\u0026nbspwas helping to reduce the taboo which surrounds miscarriages.\u0026nbspSome other countries have provisions for paid leave if a woman miscarries. Indian law instructs that women are eligible to six weeks’ leave if they miscarry a baby. However, the overwhelming majority of employees in the country carry out informal work so not many are entitled to it.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/17/19/gettyimages-945885116.jpg","title":"bitcoin morocco western sahara mining green energy dakhla soluna","story":"Created with Sketch.A massive new wind farm\u0026nbspcould help solve\u0026nbspdigital\u0026nbspcurrencies’ crippling energy needs,\u0026nbspbut critics say initiative in disputed Western Sahara comes at\u0026nbsphigh political costClick to followThe Independent OnlineActivists have taken issue with the project’s claim that the Dakhla site is in southern Morocco – pointing out the area actually lies in the disputed territory of Western SaharaFor all the revolutionary potential of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the digital inventions are extremely bad news for the environment.\u0026nbspAt the end of 2017, when bitcoin mania was at its peak, the surge in processing power needed by computers for mining and transactions upped its estimated annual energy consumption to a staggering 30 terawatt hours – roughly the same energy use as the entire country of Morocco.\u0026nbspA new blockchain company, Soluna Technologies, is building a huge 900-megawatt wind farm in Dakhla in the Sahara to power its computing needs, touted as a potential model for powering blockchain computing with renewable sources in the future.\u0026nbsp“We at Soluna have a goal, to bring abundant, efficient green energy online at utility scale,” CEO John Belizaire told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“Dakhla is one of the most promising regions for renewable energy generation in the world – and thus the perfect location for our flagship site.”The farm will take up 36,000 acres of desert classified as a high quality wind site and will also help the country of Morocco meet its goal of producing 52 per cent of its electricity from green sources by 2030.\u0026nbspActivists, however, have taken issue with the project’s claim that the Dakhla site is in southern Morocco – pointing out the area actually lies in the disputed territory of Western Sahara.\u0026nbspBitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

High electricity and other utility prices have driven protesters to the streets en masse several times since major Arab Spring protests in 2011.The Rabat authorities have built several wind energy projects in Western Sahara so far, although several UN and European Court of Justice rulings have said that Sahrawis should have full control of development of the area’s natural resources.\u0026nbspWSRW has urged Brookstone and Soluna Technologies to support the UN peace process by cancelling the Dakhla\u0026nbspproject. Its backers told Forbes\u0026nbspthey are aware of the “political sensitivities of the region” and that the investments respect Western Sahara’s international legal status.\u0026nbspThe Soluna project brings benefits for local Sahrawis as well as Rabat, Mr Belizaire said.\u0026nbspIt will create more than 1,000 high tech jobs in Dakhla and the company also plans to reinvest one per cent of the site’s revenue into local educational programmes, creating “a community of trained resources in blockchain computing and launch a centre of excellence in the region”, he added.\u0026nbspConstruction of the new wind farm and computing centre begins next year and should be connected to Morocco’s national grid in the next five years.\u0026nbspSoluna is investing $100m\u0026nbsp(£79m) into the site’s initial phase, which it hopes will generate 36 megawatts of electricity, and will then seek additional input from private equity and large institutional investors. \u0026nbspMoroccan officials\u0026nbspdid not immediately respond to requests for comment for this article.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/14/15/senator.jpg","title":"australian senator fraser anning final solution muslim immigration","story":"Created with Sketch.Crossbencher Fraser Anning widely condemned for his isive remarksClick to followIndy PoliticsAn Australian politician has provoked outrage after using the term “final solution” in an incendiary\u0026nbspspeech about immigration, in which he called for a plebiscite asking voters whether they want to stop\u0026nbspMuslims and those “from the third world” from entering the country.Queensland senator Fraser Anning’s provocative maiden speech called for an immigration program that favours “European Christian” values, claiming it would protect Australia from potential terror attacks.We as a nation are entitled to insist that those who are allowed to come here predominantly reflect the historic European-Christian composition of Australian society, the Katter’s Australian Party upper house MP said.Trump isn’t the only one whose immigration policy is doomed to failLaura Ingraham defends her immigration comments, disavows David DukeIf Trump got his way, Melania\u0027s parents would be illegal immigrantsMr Anning, who replaced Malcolm Roberts in the Senate back in June, called for “a plebiscite to allow the Australian people to decide whether they want wholesale non-English speaking immigrants from the third world, and particularly whether they want any Muslims”.“The majority of Muslims in Australia of working age do not work and exist on welfare. Muslims in New South Wales and Victoria are three times more likely than other groups to be convicted of crimes, he claimed.\u0026nbsp“We have black African Muslim gangs terrorising Melbourne, we have Isis-sympathising Muslims trying to go overseas to try and fight for Isis and while all Muslims are not terrorists, certainly all terrorists these days are Muslims.“So why would anyone want to bring more of them here?”He went on to state\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspmigrates should learn the English language and embrace Australian values.“Ethnocultural ersity ... has been allowed to rise to dangerous levels in many suburbs, he said.In direct response, self-segregation, including white flight from poorer inner-urban areas, has become the norm.World news in picturesThe flag of the United Nations flying at half-mast to mark the death of former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, at the European headquarters in Geneva.

TV host GRILLS People\u0027s Vote spokesman in heated rowThey include Theresa May agreeing a deal with the EU as early as October and getting it through Parliament ahead of leaving day, next March 29.Other scenarios are Parliament rejecting her deal and either settling for a no-deal exit or sending her back to Brussels for more talks.Mrs May herself could declare it impossible to strike a deal so Britain leaves without one, or she might not get a deal but Parliament sends her back to negotiations rather than quit without agreement.The report says it is possible the Government or Parliament could order another referendum for voters to break a deadlock. (Image:  )But it notes: The mechanics of referendums are far from easy.Problems include that the UK does not have a comprehensive blueprint for referendums, so details have to be decided each time - probably sparking bitter political skirmishes on issues like timing and who should have a vote.Even more problematic, what would the referendum be about? the authors ask.Tory former Cabinet minister Justine Greening has suggested a three-question referendum with the choice of leaving the EU with no deal, leaving on the PM\u0027s deal, or staying in the EU.But the Institute said this raised timing issues.The UK is only guaranteed staying in on its current terms if it withdraws its Article 50 leaving application by March 29.Only an outline withdrawal agreement could be made by March and some details of a long-term deal would have to be hammered out afterwards - which the report said could see MPs agitating to have different versions of Brexit on the ballot paper.Meanwhile the Electoral Commission watchdog says six months are needed for a referendum to be well-conducted - which would probably mean the Government postponing exit day, which Mrs May has said she will not do.People\u0027s Vote campaign march to Parliament, (Image: WHEATLEYWENN)Institute for GovernmentThe authors concluded: In short, a Greening-style referendum on the timescale she appears to propose (before the UK formally leaves the EU) would only work if it produces a majority for Remain.It would not settle the issue for any other outcome.\u0026nbspBut it is not practical to ask people to vote on the arcane issues of the withdrawal agreement\u0026nbsp - which would come down to a fight about the \u0027orce bill\u0027.So, in practice, unless there is a clearly emerging majority (which can survive a bitter referendum campaign) for Remain, a referendum would solve nothing.

Unfortunately, I was wrong.Mr Zarif did not commit to Iran signing a new nuclear deal with the US and said the possibility of a new deal is dependent on President Trump and whether he can prove he is a \u0026ldquoreliable partner.The Iranian Foreign Minister also believes a meeting between President Trump and President Rouhani would not be effective at the current time.President Rouhani has equally previously stated that Iran \u0026ldquoalways welcomed negotiations, but warned that the US would need to halt sanctions before future negotiations could take place.He said: \u0026ldquoNegotiations with sanctions doesn\u0026rsquot make sense.\u0026ldquoThey are imposing sanctions on Iranian children, patients and the nation.\u0026ldquoIf you\u0026rsquore an enemy and you stab the other person with a knife and then you say you want negotiations, then the first thing you have to do is remove the knife.The diplomatic row is not likely to end in the near future, as President Trump intends to implement a second wave of sanctions in November, which are set to target Iran\u0026rsquos oil and energy industries.Oil production is a significant part of the Iranian economy, accounting for one fifth of GDP.

And the party will look at this I am sure extremely forcefully at the next conference.Lets wait and see what conference decides.“Theres always a rule in politics: if youre on the front pages for too long you become the story and thats not good because you miss all the good and effective things that the Labour Party is doing in terms of policy and holding this government to account.”Host Julia Hartley-Brewer asked her: “Do you think that a man who lays wreaths at the tombs of terrorists who have killed innocent people is fit to be the British Prime Minister?”But Ms Moon would only reply: “That will be a decision for the British people.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There would be no Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus or arguably Lady Gaga without Madonna.She might not be the best singer or dancer in the world, but she’s certainly the best at just being Madonna.You simply can’t imagine anyone ever telling her what to do. She’d laugh in their face.Madonna had always known how to grab attention, whether it’s publishing a book stuffed full of naked photos of herself, faking self-pleasure on stage, or kissing Britney Spears.And only Madonna could have bounced back from almost being strangled by her bright red Armani cape when she took a tumble and fell on her backside during the Brit Awards three years ago.She merely dusted herself down and carried on regardless, but I bet whoever was in charge of her wardrobe that night would have been given the b******ing of their life.Madonna is always in charge, professionally and personally. Even during her brief fling with aging lothario Warren Beatty, he was very much a bit player in the Madonna Show.That must have badly bruised the ego of a man who had always had the upper-hand in his relationships until then.It has to be said her love life hasn’t been anywhere near as successful as her career.There was a brief, destructive marriage to American actor Sean Penn in the Eighties and in 2000 she married Guy Ritchie, but the couple divorced eight years later.Since then she has dated a string of handsome and often young men, but they usually seemed to have the whiff of a photo opportunity about them rather than anything long term.She chews them up, spits them out and moves on to the next one.Madonna seems happiest as a single mum.She has uprooted the family to Lisbon, in Portugal,  because her adopted son David wants to play professional football.With her vast wealth she could easily have bought him a team such as LA Galaxy but she has always had a Calvinistic work ethic that she has tried to pass on to her kids.She has also made up with son Rocco Ritchie after a bitter custody battle and appears to be in a very good place.In an era where most young female vocalists all sound the same — bored, whiny and more than a wee bit yodelly — we really do need a one-off like Madonna.I hope she had a fabulous birthday on Thursday in Marrakech, Morocco, and danced until dawn to all of her greatest hits.Happy 60th birthday, ma’am, and I’ve no doubt you will still be in your fishnets and basques when you get that 100-year birthday message.Just when the royals and their advisers thought the whole fiasco between Meghan Markle and her dad had gone quiet, there comes a bizarre twist.Meghan’s rent-a-gob half-sister Samantha, who seethes with rage and jealousy, has announced that Thomas Markle is bringing out his own clothing range.This led to speculation as to what the brand might be called.  “Markle \u0026amp Spencer” or “Primarkles”  (thank you, Alan Carr). But joking aside, surely this can’t be a serious  concept.Apart from being a crass, money-grabbing exercise cashing in on a quasi-royal connection, who on earth would buy garments from a pensioner who dresses like a hobo?I’ve had a great deal of sympathy for Thomas  in the past. He was treated poorly in the build-up to the  Royal Wedding, when his daughter married Prince Harry.He should have been embraced by his new family and given guidance on how to deal with the  media attention.Instead he was cast adrift. The result? Those stupid paparazzi set-up photos and a series of interviews that painted Meghan in a poor light.Every time her dad talks on TV or to newspapers and magazines, her popularity is dented.The two of them obviously have a fraught relationship. It turns out Thomas didn’t attend Meghan’s first wedding in 2011 either.Thomas increasingly comes across as bitter, angry and dislikable.To gain media attention he keeps making more and more outrageous accusations.My advice would be to stop listening to his bitchy daughter Samantha and maintain a dignified silence.All thoughts of profiteering through a clothing range or any commercial activity must be abandoned forthwith.That just might mean there could be some  sort of reconciliation in the future.Otherwise he will lose his daughter forever.ONE of the week’s most astonishing stories involved a young US woman who has been given her life back with a groundbreaking face transplant.Three years ago, Katie Stubblefield, from Mississippi in the US, tried to take her own life and shot herself in the face with a hunting rifle. She was just 18.Doctors saved her life but she was left with a mass of scar tissue instead of a face.Katie, the youngest person ever to receive a face transplant, endured more than 30 hours of surgery.Of course, the operation requires a donor – and in this case it is  a very sad story.Katie received the face  of a mum who died of a drug overdose.She was a registered organ donor and her grandmother bravely approved the donation.That decision can’t have been easy and we should always salute those who are donors, and the loved ones who give their consent.Katie won’t look like anything like her donor because the “face” is moulded on to her new bone structure.She continues to heal and  make progress, but this kind of surgery is still in its infancy.She will always look “different” but she has a second chance of life and now wants to help others in anguish and with suicidal thoughts.It’s an incredible story of despair that turned to  hope.  The skill and dedication of the team of surgeons and medics that helped her is awe-inspiring.I’m always surprised to learn that Caroline Flack is 38 years old.The presenter looks a  lot younger – and at the moment she is acting like a lovesick teenager going through the agony and ecstasy of her first serious crush.Her off/on romance with red carpet fever victim Andrew Brady is becoming laughable.This week the couple apparently had yet another spat in a London ­restaurant.If these two are to have any chance of staying together long term, they need to get out of the public eye and spend some quiet time alone.I’m sure Caroline knows of a certain Love Island that isn’t being used right now. That would do very well.The ending of the second series of The Handmaid’s Tale had me shouting in despair at my TV.I don’t want to give away too many spoilers but this cliffhanger will break your heart.It also, however, sets up season three for long overdue revenge.As always, astonishing performances from Elisabeth Moss as  June/Ofglen and Yvonne Strahovski as Serena Joy.They will soon fight it out for real when the TV actress awards are up for grabs.I’ve lost track of the amount of slippers our border terrier puppy Angus has chewed up, but this week he surpassed himself by getting his paws on his Pet Passport and virtually destroying it when we were in Spain.Luckily a  local vet issued him with a Spanish version and he now boasts dual nationality.He’s suddenly developed a liking for an afternoon siesta, but at least we were able to get him back into the UK – although who knows what will happen to him after Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Jeremy did not honour those responsible for the Munich killings”.Holding a wreath should not be reckoned to be any kind of endorsement of the wreath we know Jeremy deplores this kind of thing and, indeed, all other forms of wreath.Hark, though, at how quickly the approved line may shift. What was a “smear” yesterday is a forgotten truth today, airbrushed from history because, well, that’s the way these people do these things.The new line is Jeremy wants to see “a fitting memorial to everyone who died in every terrorist incident everywhere”.I dare say he’ll be visiting Enniskillen soon. Of course.And yet, in one sense there really isn’t very much to look at. Or, rather, very little that is new. This is who Corbyn is and who he has always been.He has never bothered hiding this, leaving one to assume he only does so now because there is some small, nagging part of his brain which accepts it might be sensible to do so, since failing to hide it might prove politically inconvenient.Even so, he cannot change. Anyone who has been at university will recognise Corbyn and all his fellow travellers.These were the people — some of them clever but not many of them intelligent — who fouled student politics for everyone else.The chiselling parsers and pedants and revolutionaries whose appetite for procedural minutiae bored everyone else into submission.And usually that would be that. They would, most of them, grow up eventually. But not St Jeremy and not his devotional disciples, either.They are greyer now but as instantly recognisable as they always were: Experts in room-clearing.They ought, by rights, to be confined to dingy rooms above down-at-heel pubs, where they could cut and paste their thuddingly dreary newsletters. Instead, mystifyingly, they have been given control of one of Britain’s great political parties.How much will this summer of anti-Semitism really cut through with the average voter? Less than you might think, I suspect.In the first place — and this may be a good thing — Twitter remains a niche platform and political Twitter a niche even there.Secondly, the public have already made up their minds about Corbyn and they think he’s a dud.Each month YouGov asks whether Jeremy Corbyn or Theresa May seems the best available Prime Minister and each month Corbyn trails.Sometimes he is also beaten by “Don’t know”. That’s Corbyn: He can come third in a two-horse race.But, they splutter, look at what a kind and gentle and decent man he is. Why can’t other people see that he’s a valiant activist for peace?Possibly because, for a decent fellow, he spends a startling amount of time with thoroughly indecent people.He keeps falling in with the wrong crowd while never being a member of the wrong crowd himself. There is no need here to document the long list of unsavoury people with whom Corbyn has been happy to associate himself because, really, what is now the point? He is who he is and we know who he is.In Corbyn’s world every-thing has a single, simple explanation. Colonialism is the root cause of all root causes.That insight — if we can call it that — dictated his views on Ireland just as it dictates his views on the Middle East, Cuba, Venezuela and everywhere else.From there it is but a short leap to the kind of deluded wishful thinking that animates what passes for his thinking. Once you have assumed that Northern Ireland should not exist, you absolve yourself of any and all need to think about what should happen next.You may ignore the inconvenient, and stubborn, reality that Northern Ireland — like, well, Israel — does exist and is not going to disappear.Practical politics means wrestling with things as they are, not as you think they should have been decades previously.But if you start with the theory, you may avoid practical reality. If this leaves you with nothing — precisely nothing — useful to say then so be it. You will at least remain pure in heart.If this means you are no kind of “peace campaigner” at all, that’s fine too, because you will be shielded by your own impenetrable sanctimony.As poses go, this is an awfully comfortable one but it’s not serious politics.Perhaps Corbyn really is just unlucky. But it seems more probable that he’s not. And that, far from being the decent man of legend he’s actually thoroughly indecent.The only possible alternative is that he’s thunderously, crushingly, toe-curlingly thick.On balance, however, it seems more probable that he is, in fact, both.Enough of this. Enough, already.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250 or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Those who have are mostly Remainers who would now vote Leave.Many people are deeply sceptical about the tedious stumbling blocks that have bogged down the process.Almost half — 48 per cent — think the political classes are deliberately making heavy weather of Brexit in the hope it will convince the public to change their minds.Six in ten believe the EU is out to punish the UK by refusing to compromise in talks on trade and free movement, our Deltapoll survey says.But the vast majority are convinced a departure deal will be hammered out in the end, even if it takes longer than expected.Former Cabinet minister Priti Patel last night said: “The Sun on Sunday’s poll shows that the British people ultimately believe we can build a stronger future for our country outside the EU.Nearly half of adults believe the weather goes in cycles and that heatwaves come around from time to time.Barely a third of voters believe the human race is responsible and that we will have more extreme temperatures unless we act soon.Our poll found that a majority of 18 to 24-year-olds blame global warming for the hottest British summer since 1976.But in every other age group, most people think it has little or nothing to do with climate change.Six in ten over-55s believe it was “just another hot summer”.“It is clear that most people are sick to the back teeth of being ­bullied by the EU and listening to politicians at home erecting all kinds of obstacles to prevent them honouring the referendum result.“The Government should sit up and heed the results of this poll. That means being tougher in negotiations with Brussels and doing what the nation voted for — to get Britain out of the EU.”Most people — 55 per cent — are against a second in-out referendum, according to our poll.Forty per cent think we should just leave in 222 days’ time as planned with or without a deal.Fifteen per cent want a vote on the final deal, but not a re-run on whether or not Britain leaves the EU.Overall, only 13 per cent have changed their minds on Brexit since the referendum on June 23, 2016. Most of those were once Remainers. Fifteen per cent of them admit to having shifted their view — equivalent to 2.4 million people.That compares with just 11 per cent of Brexit backers, 1.9 million, who have had a rethink.Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said the poll had “nailed the lie” that many people regret voting Leave.Deltapoll director Martin Boon said the findings show most people are taking a tougher stance on Brexit.He added: “Half the public believe themselves to be under siege from the political classes trying to change their minds.“But the message they are sending back is that they haven’t changed their minds and the likelihood is they won’t.”Voters are evenly divided on whether there will be a hard border after Brexit. Twenty-two per cent say there will, 21 per cent say otherwise.There is also a split over whether leaving the EU will prove a historic mistake. Forty-four per cent think it will, 30 per cent believe it will not. One statement united 59 per cent of voters — “I’m really bored by Brexit.”Separately, our poll found that most people think former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was right to raise the difficult and sensitive issue of women wearing burkas. Two-thirds believe he was right to start a debate about the Muslim veil.But some say he should say sorry because he went “over the top” by comparing wearers to “bank robbers” or “letterboxes”. Half of Tory supporters and 36 per cent of all voters believe his remarks were right and he has nothing to apologise for.A further 28 per cent say he went a little too far with his language and should admit it.He gets no support from 23 per cent, who say his remarks were offensive and he should say sorry.Deltapoll interviewed an online sample of 1,904 adults aged 18+ from August 14 to 16. Results have been weighted to the profile of all GB adults.The Labour leader has defied the odds after damaging revelations about the friends he keeps.Half of voters believe Labour has a problem with anti-Semitism. More than a third say Mr Corbyn is part of that problem.But a Sun on Sunday Deltapoll has Labour three points ahead of the Tories.If there were an election tomorrow, Labour would be 31 seats short of a majority but with enough MPs to form a government with Scottish Nationalist support.Tory backing has been sapped as traditional supporters switch to Ukip in protest over the PM’s weak handling of Brexit.There is little to celebrate for any of the party leaders who all get negative popularity ratings.Mr Corbyn scores minus 35, while Theresa May is on minus 26 — only two points better than floundering Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable.Today, a Sun on Sunday poll shows that idea to be total codswallop.Voters simply want our politicians to get on with delivering Brexit.The majority of people have not changed their mind since the referendum.Our poll shows those that have are mostly Remainers who would now vote Leave.Project Fear has never worked, and it is not going to suddenly start working now.

Even those of us who will never hit the big time have an Instagram audience waiting to “like” our every selfie.So this is just the logical next step towards making cosmetic surgery available to the masses, rather than the few.Some have argued that Superdrug Botox is actually a good thing, because it bridges the gap between the elite Harley Street options — where you pay several hundred pounds for an appointment with an “aesthetic doctor” — and the more backstreet treatments carried out by hairdressers with just a few hours of training.I disagree. Being able to buy a syringe or two of Botox when you are out shopping for your hairspray legitimises — and normalises — the act of injecting poison in your skin in the name of beauty.Being able to buy Botox over the counter, so to speak, makes it seem like no big deal — just another tick in the “maintenance” box, and as reasonable as tinting your lashes or getting your ears pierced.And that is the problem. All decisions we make about our appearance boil down to personal choice. And if it makes someone feel better to tinker cosmetically or surgically with their natural looks, that’s their choice. No one should judge them for it.But there is a wider problem.Increasingly, women think that whatever they look like naturally isn’t good enough. More and more, the “solution” is invasive cosmetic enhancement.A mainstream shop making Botox available for less than 100 quid is surely only going to add to the pressure some women feel to change their appearance using more than just make-up.Superdrug presents itself as responsible because it will refuse to treat under-25s, when other clinics will.That is shocking — not so much that some clinics WILL treat under-25s but that anyone so young could think they need Botox.You can’t blame Superdrug for this epidemic. It is simple supply and demand.The question is: Why the growing desire among women to look frozen?It’s not like you can get away with saying you’ve not had it when you have, because it’s so obvious.I’ve got a friend whose husband jokes that she needs to hold up little signs saying “happy” or “angry” when she feels an emotion, since her face is so paralysed by botulism.While I’m a big believer in your body, your choice, I’m also a believer in scratching the right itch.The truth is if you feel good about yourself, you look good. If you feel bad and lack confidence, nothing, no amount of Botox or fillers, will ever change that.Just look at Meg from Love Island, above, who, even after an estimated £40,000 worth of plastic surgery, is still massively insecure.Because it’s not what’s on the outside that counts, it’s what’s on the inside.The problem is our society tends to give far too much weight to the outside. That is especially the case for women, but increasingly for men, too.I realise all of this is easy to say, harder to act on. I’m as susceptible as the next person to comparing myself with ­others more beautiful — and possibly more airbrushed — and finding myself lacking.I’m just glad that, when that happens, I know the thing that will make me feel better is far more likely to be self-acceptance than Botox.After all, if you tighten a prune you don’t get a grape — you just get a tight prune!So the really big question is, how to achieve self-acceptance when we are surrounded by all these images of perfection?Well, we are all on our own journey with that one but I’ve got some suggestions which might help.The first is to focus on what you have, rather than what you don’t. And the second is to never, ever compare yourself to anyone else.Forget Botox, you can have that advice for free.You’re welcome.We all enjoyed cheering on the Three Lions players that would quickly become our heroes during the World Cup in Russia this summer.Sadly, those heady days are over and we were reminded of the seamier side of sport this week with the arrest of England rugby union ace Danny Cipriani.His embarrassing brawl outside a Jersey nightclub came hot on the heels of England cricket’s Ben Stokes’ trial over his clash with two men during a night out.Stokes was cleared, but what links these sorry sagas is our drinking culture, which dictates that consuming excessive amounts of alcohol is a normal way of letting off steam.Sportsmen are supposed to be role models, as they influence young people and need to keep themselves in good physical shape.But as long as we think it is OK to binge and push our bodies to the limits rather than sip a few drinks, then violence, injuries and stupid mistakes will continue to be a regular feature of our nights out.And if you are an England sports star, then public shame is just one of the tragic consequences – along with the end of your career – that you might have to face.Why should anyone be surprised at the news that sexual harassment in the police force is rife?Let’s face it, it happens everywhere. So why should the police be any exception?I thought they might hold themselves to higher standards. But no.A new survey reveals that dirty jokes, inappropriate touching, leering and being pressured to have sex are daily issues for many police staff.In a survey of almost 1,800 police staff in England, Wales and Scotland, half had heard sexualised jokes and one in five had received a sexually explicit email or text from a colleague.Shockingly, one in five had also been touched in a way that made them feel uncomfortable.Our head of police at West Ham is a woman.She is smart, tough, brave and would never put up with this type of behaviour.Part of the problem is that many women accept these actions as “normal” and don’t even know how to object. We must learn to stop putting up with it.But it is much more important that men learn what is OK and what is not.End of.Jacinda Ardern – the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who has continued to work since becoming a mother in June – was criticised this week for “using her baby as a prop” after she was seen breastfeeding her daughter at a public meeting.I guess whoever coined that phrase has never had the experience of looking after a baby who needs to be fed – right NOW.Nor will they have dealt with the very loud consequences of that failing to happen.Instead, what about congratulating Jacinda on doing such a great job of being a working mum?We said farewell to two legends last week, let’s remember them with this wonderful meme....So interesting that the day after A-level results arrived, more than 26,000 university places were still available.An Ipsos Mori poll found that while most students still think university is “important”, that is down from 86 per cent five years ago to 75 per cent now.Since a degree is expensive – and no guarantee of a job – you can see why people are questioning the validity of one.However, there is no viable alternative.There are just 10,000 degree-level apprenticeships available, compared with 300,000 university places, according to Sir Peter Lampl, of the Sutton Trust.We need to think how we prepare young people for work and we need more technical qualifications at degree level that offer the chance of a bright future.GOT a story?

I was starting to think I was going to have to go back home to my long suffering and much more sensible wife and explain why I had been back to the Wondiwoi mountains and not found anything.I was really rushing around. I couldnt quite get the photo. I was thinking calm down, this is a really, really rare species, it might be the last one.I needed to steady my hand and lean on something, but the thing Im leaning against is covered in spines.But I was also thinking I could be coming home with a lot of photos of a lot of leaves.I was thinking to myself I have to be careful here and not fool myself, but I went through my mental check list of their features and realised hang on, this has absolutely got to be the Wondiwoi tree kangaroo.I felt like Captain Ahab if he had got photos of Moby Dick.Michael plans to return to the near-impenetrable mountainous rainforest next year with conservationists, experts and camera traps to find more.He also plans to apply for permits to allow him to bring back poo samples which experts have already offered to DNA match with the 1928 skeleton currently housed in Londons Natural History Museum.He flew from Gatwick to Indonesias capital Jakarta last month, followed by an internal four-hour flight to a town called Manokwari, then he took a ferry to Wasior.He recruited a hunter turned guide Martin, interpreter Norman and four porters, and they bought enough rice, noodles, sardines and chili sauce to last two weeks.Michael had visited the same region a year earlier to look at rhododendrons and orchids and the team trekked up Mount Wondiwoi to a camp they had previously created at 700m.Battling through bamboo thicket with machetes, they cut further to 1,300m where they formed a second base camp using logs, tarp, sacks and nails.They spent the following days exploring the mountain to look at orchids but they reached 1,700m they spotted the tell-tale claw marks at the base of trees.A few expeditions have returned to the region - but it remains largely untouched and unexplored due to the remote location and impenetrable thick vegetation on steep slopes.We started to see these claw marks at the base of tree and even I started to think hang on, said Michael.We were in the same area and we started to smell this funky scent and saw tree kangaroo poo.On the last and seventh exploration day they were returning to camp when eagle-eyed Martin spotted a tree kangaroo on a branch 30m up, on July 31.They surrounded the tree and stood in silence for 30 minutes while Michael snapped using an £80 second hand long lens, in the last minutes of dwindling sunlight.Tree-kangaroos are small animals which inhabit tropical rainforests in New Guinea.Most species of tree-kangaroos are considered endangered because of hunting and their habitats being destroyed.The Wondiwoi tree-kangaroo is the rarest having only ever been seen in Indonesia, once, 90 years ago.Michael Smiths pictures are the first time the animal was caught on camera.Experts agree the creature in the photo appears to be the 1928 Wondiwoi tree kangaroo - with yellowy fur, with a short tail, wide face and broad paws - which is housed in the Natural History Museum.There are other tree kangaroos in Indonesia - but they live at lower altitudes or in different mountain regions, and are a different colour.Basically we found the animal the last half hour of the last day we had available to search, and even that was because I decided to go down all in one day rather than two as planned."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000427555672.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"family of 11 on 22k benefits demand six bed house because they cant find one big enough","story":"The Hussain family, from Birmingham, have been split across three apartments 100 miles from their home city after they were evicted from their privately-rented flat.The family, who currently receive around £22,000-a-year in child tax credits, are being put up in three flats in Bristol city centre while council chiefs try to find them a home.Birmingham City Council said it had accepted the familys homelessness application after they were illegally evicted from their rented three-bed house but has struggled to find a property large enough to meet their needs.The family had initially been forced to stay in Travelodge rooms after being evicted in June before they were moved on to other temporary homes in Staffordshire.They estimate it is currently costing around £1,000-a-week to house them in Bristol.Mum Simone told Birmingham Live: I think it’s about £150-a-night to stay here because my mum was going to come down.

And she said she was singing to not feel cold in the sea overnight.Speaking after the incredible rescue, the Brit said: I fell off the back of the Norwegian Star and I was in the water for about 10 hours. These wonderful guys rescued me.Kay is believed to have fallen overboard around 60 miles south of Pula shortly before midnight last night. She had reportedly spent the night drinking before plunging from the ship.A desperate search was launched and the Croatian Coast Guard patrol ship “Cavtat” and a PC-9 search plane were scrambled to save her.She was found at around 9.30am this morning local time (8.30am UK time) around 1,300 metres from where she vanished and was lifted to safety.Wearing just denim shorts and a top, Kay plucked from the 20C water by coastguards and taken on board a rescue boat.Asked her name and where she was from by reporters, she replied: Kay... from England. She was treated by medics and taken to hospital in Pula but was discharged a short time later.A hospital official confirmed: The British woman was brought to the hospital and her life is not endangered.Croatian authorities are set to examine CCTV footage from the ship amid reports the alarm was raised after she left her bag and passport on deck.It is understood the Brit, who was said to have signs of hypothermia when found, was later reunited with her family, who were also on the liner.By JOHN LUCASSEA survival expert Mike Tipton said last night Kay was lucky to have plunged into warm water.He added: “It would have been a pretty frightening experience but everything that needed to be in place for her to survive was in place. It was warm water and it was flat, calm water.“The survival times are usually one hour in five degrees, two hours in ten, six in 15.“But as soon as you get to around 20C then you can predict survival up to about 25 hours.”Mr Tipton, co-author of Essentials of Sea Survival, went on:  “Being female she is going to have about ten per cent more body fat than a man so she is going to be able to float.”He added: “The  luckiest thing was they were able to find her. It really would have been like looking for a needle in a haystack.”Kay said she was “sitting at the back” when she fell from the ship at about 11.45pm on Saturday.Croatian Ministry of Maritime Affairs spokesman David Radas said: “Our rescuers were in touch with the Norwegian Star’s crew and by checking  CCTV knew the exact moment she fell in the water.A spokesman for the cruise company said: A report was made that a guest aboard Norwegian Star had gone overboard while the ship was returning to Venice.As soon as the report was made the ship began a search and notified the appropriate authorities.The ship will be delayed on her return to Venice.Ship captain Lovro Oreskovic added: The British woman was exhausted when we pulled her out of the water.We were extremely happy for saving a human life.”The Foreign Office is understood to be in contact with Croatian authorities over the welfare of a British national rescued at sea.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is whether the PM herself will seize the initiative and signal her own plan to jump before she is pushed.The undeclared contest has transformed Britain’s negotiating stance — from Theresa May’s meek, slow-motion surrender to a strident demand for a decent, honourable settlement. The good news is that while MPs have been away on holiday, Brussels has begun to blink.At long last it has dawned on our EU neighbours that they have more to lose from a messy Brexit than we do.Forfeiting the UK’s £40billion ransom payment — plus our annual £12billion contribution — would instantly cripple the EU expansionary budget plans and plunge poorer nations such as Greece into crisis.Car and pharmaceutical giants, not to mention French farmers, who export vast stocks to the UK, would be plunged into crisis. Cooperation on crime, security and defence would be at risk. Governments across Europe are now piling pressure on Brussels to see sense.Tory leadership wannabes have sniffed the way the wind is blowing.The Tories won’t pick another Remainer as party leader. Nor does this Government have a prayer at the next election unless it can see off Nigel Farage and his Ukip insurgents with a deal that satisfies the 52 per cent who voted Leave.This explains a sudden enthusiasm at the top for stating the blindingly obvious: Britain will survive a clean Brexit, while an obstructive Brussels will be diminished.After two years of being bossed around by EU bully Michel Barnier, senior Cabinet ministers are coming out as born-again Eurosceptics. Foreign Secretary and repentant Remainer Jeremy Hunt admits Britain will experience some turbulence, but says the EU will be damaged “for a generation”.His warning is echoed by Brexit supremo Dominic Raab, who has rubbished “Project Fear” stories about food and medicine shortages.While loyally insisting a deal is “still the most likely outcome”, Mr Raab insists Britain will cope with the alternative.Hunt and Raab are now openly jockeying for the top job — along with Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, Treasury chief Liz Truss and a host of others.Significantly, Michael Gove seems out of the race after endorsing Mrs May’s Chequers sellout. So where does this leave Boris Johnson? If tens of thousands of grass- roots Tory supporters have anything to do with it, he would be way out in front. As things stand, they don’t.BoJo is out of office and fighting confected outrage over Muslim face masks. Enemies such as the priestly Dominic Grieve threaten to quit the party if he is elected.Under present rules, Boris needs enough support from fellow MPs to be one of the two candidates submitted to party members for a final verdict. His rivals will do anything to stop him — which is why party activists are demanding rule changes to allow any MP with 20 votes to enter the final ballot.Boris has gone quiet — but not for long. He is reportedly planning a nationwide tour — complete with bright-red battle bus — trashing Mrs May’s Chequers deal and calling for a clean Brexit.There will be plenty of opportunities for car-crash interviews and zipwire-style TV images. But the bookies aren’t the only ones making BoJo the clear favourite as Britain’s next Prime Minister.He names Somalis, Ethiopians, North and Central Africans and Afghans as being responsible for the knife-gang slaughter of young black and Asian men.“Race is part of the picture,” says the equality campaigner. “Failing to point this out impedes the fight against these crimes and imperils yet more children of colour.”He is right, isn’t he?But how long before this decent black man is himself accused of racism for daring to tell this unvarnished truth?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The rest of the pool was closed to the public.“Josiah was distressed so I thought I would give him some milk. I thought if we got out he would get cold, so I moved away and turned my back to the group.

The Ministry of Justice will put in place a new governor and senior management at the jail which is currently run by G4S and which inspectors say is poor in every category - only the second time they have awarded the lowest classification. Inspectors found the prison in “an appalling state” with high violence, widespread bullying, squalid living conditions and poor control by fearful staff. The MoJ decision comes as the chief prisons inspector has invoked a special measure calling on the Justice Secretary David Gauke to launch an urgent and independent enquiry into the crisis. In a letter sent to David Gauke on 16 August, Peter Clarke demanded an explanation for how the prison had “been allowed to deteriorate so dramatically” since its last inspection 18 months ago. Inspectors found that out of the 70 recommendations made at the previous inspection - just 14 had been achieved while none of the main recommendations concerning violence, staff-prisoner relationships, poor regimes and a lack of focus on education, training and work had been met.  The damning letter reveals a catalogue of failures and paints a picture of a total loss of control on the part of the G4S management. HMP Birmingham has the largest volume of assaults (1,434) of all prisons in the year to July 2018. Experts found that the assaults were often serious and that prisoners and staff frequently needed hospital treatment. As a result a number of prisoners were isolating themselves in their cells. Those the inspectors found wee locked in their cells for over 23 hours - sometimes even 24 hours a day but they still felt unsafe describing ongoing intimidation “including other prisoners squirting urine or throwing faeces through their broken observation panels”. Staff were often targeted, including in an arson attack during the week of the inspection which destroyed nine staff vehicles (seven belonging to staff and two being used by the inspection team) in a car park next to the prison. When it came to drugs inspectors found that they were being used quite openly while testing suggested a third of prisoners were using illicit substances. One in seven said they had developed a problem with illicit drugs since they had been in Birmingham. Meanwhile in the 18 months between inspections three prisoners took their own lives. Inspectors found that the prison was filthy - especially the shared areas. Mr Clarke explained how rubbish had been left to build up and there were widespread problems with insects - including cockroaches. He said:“We saw evidence of bodily fluids left unattended, includingblood and vomit. I saw a shower area where there was bloodstained clothing and a pool of blood that had apparently been there for two days, next to numerous rat droppings.”  The chief inspector outlined “significant concerns” about the “confidence and competence” of those in charge of managing offenders and those arranging a prisoner’s release. He said that little had been done to address the risks posed by the more than doubling of the number of sex offenders to more than 200. Mr Clarke said he had concerns about the release of high-risk prisoners. He said: “Between August and November this year, 50 high-risk men are due to be released and we were greatly concerned that measures to protect the public from those men – while in prison and on release – were very poor.” Mr Clarke said he believed improvements would not take place without understanding why the conract between the Government and G4S has failed. He said: “The inertia that seems to have gripped both those monitoring the contract and delivering it on the ground has led to one of Britain’s leading jails slipping into a state of crisis that is remarkable even by the low standards we have seen all too frequently in recent years.” The MoJ will take over the running of the prison for an initial six months but this will be extended if sufficient progress is not made.

The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) is calling for an increase in the so-called national living wage to allow families to have an acceptable standard of living. Its Cost Of A Child report showed an 11% weekly shortfall for a couple raising two children at the point they are aged three and seven. Worse, however, was the deficit for lone parents, who fall 20% short each week of being able to provide a level of living for their children defined as acceptable by public opinion. The charity blamed rising prices, benefits and tax credit freezes, the bedroom tax and the roll-out of Universal Credit for hitting “family budgets hard”.   Woman\u0027s amazing open letter to snobs who look down on care workers: We don\u0027t just wipe bums  The charity’s chief executive Alison Garnham said: “There is strong public support for Government topping up the wages of low-paid parents and investing in children is the best long-term investment we can make. “By using the forthcoming Budget to unfreeze benefits and restore work allowances, the Government can take steps towards making work really pay.” Gains from increased minimum wages were offset by a freeze in tax credit support, the research said.

Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright is being lined up to follow in the footsteps of Tupac, Freddie Mercury, Michael Jackson and Princess Leia at this year’s Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham. The newly minted Culture and digital boss is notoriously technophobic. During more than 13 years in Parliament, prior to being made Culture Secretary, he said the word “digital” twice.  And before taking the job, his official Twitter account had only five tweets, including retweets.  But according to the Sunday Times, he’s set to embrace the future of…well, Coachella 2012, and deliver his keynote at the party’s annual gathering in virtual form.  Perhaps the oddest thing about the idea, cooked up by his predecessor Matt Hancock before he was promoted to Health Secretary - is that there’s really no reason for it. Where holograms have been used in the past, it’s been for reasons of death or intergalactic civil war. But unless a Tory Secretary of State has taken the unusual step of double booking himself the week of conference, he’ll just…be there anyway. He could even watch his own speech from the audience.  A source close to Mr Wright told the Times: “He understands the need to embrace this kind of developing technology.” If the effect is created in the same way as previous on-stage holograms, the developing technology is a technique known as Pepper\u0027s Ghost - developed by Henry Pepper in 1862. The trick uses glass and projections to create the illusion of a ghostly object or figure appearing on stage. It\u0027s been used frequently in Disneyland theme parks since the 1950s. Of course, there is one member of the party who might wish she could have delivered her speech remotely last year.

She’s worked hard to get to this point – and she nearly didn’t get here at all. Earlier this summer, in front of a large crowd, her designs were on show at Graduate Fashion Week in London’s trendy Shoreditch. Susan had always loved making clothes, spending her teenage years fashioning Vogue patterns to wear to parties and lusting after clothes from BIBA and Mary Quant.  However, life got in the way of taking her fashion dreams any further. When her children Tom and Laura, now in their 30s, were little, she relished the opportunity to make them sweet little outfits.  It was easy as they were so small and it didn’t take much fabric, she laughs. But it just didn’t occur to me that I could do this for a job.  Instead, Susan worked as everything from a waitress to a cook in an old people’s home, before getting a job as a note-taker at a charity.  When government cuts meant the charity had to reduce my days, I thought I’d use the opportunity to take up an A-level on my extra day off, and of course I chose Textiles, she says.  I remember thinking, \u0027At last, I know what I want to do with myself, I want to be creative.\u0027 But after her first year of study, the local college decided to drop the subject from the syllabus.  I was so upset as I was enjoying it so much – I thought, \u0027I’ve got to find a way to carry this on.\u0027  Susan found an HND in fashion and textiles that sounded perfect but there was one big drawback – she’d have to give up her job. It was a really tough decision because I’ve always worked, but I really didn’t want to stop designing either. Taking the leap So at the age of 61, Susan quit her job to pursue her passion. Her husband Duncan was supportive and she took out a student loan to fund her studies.  I loved learning all the different techniques like quilting, batik, pattern making, she says.  I felt I was in my element, and getting my hands dirty with bleach and dyes, I’d never felt happier. At the end of the HND, Susan knew she couldn’t stop, and after an open day at the University of Northampton, she signed up to do a degree in fashion.  I was terrified on my first day, and hid behind the door, she says.  It was decades since I’d last been in full-time education, and I was worried what the other students, all in their 20s, would think of me. But I couldn’t have had a nicer group, and no one ever made me feel like I was any different.

In the bizarre clip, the flight attendant, whose name badge is visible, holds the tights and two pairs of shoes to her nose and says: “I wish you could smell this.” She talks about just having made a flight knickerless, then teasingly goes on to unbutton her blouse to reveal cleavage before blowing a kiss. The air hostess was grounded by horrified BA bosses after the clip began to be circulated. A source said: “It was doing the rounds and they hit the roof.” It is not known why the woman made the film. But there is a thriving market in hard-up staff from other unidentified airlines flogging worn tights and shoes to fetishists on eBay.  The video passed to the Sunday Mirror shows the woman saying: “Don’t look at how rough I look after the flight. “So you want me to smell my shoes and my tights? Well, first of all, I’ve got to take the tights off.” She then slides them down her legs before ripping off her lanyard and continuing: “These I’ve been wearing all day, with no knickers, just for you.” Burying her nose in the tights, she inhales before throwing them aside and holding up two pairs of black shoes. She says: “I wasn’t sure what shoes you wanted me to smell, so I got both.” Closing her eyes, she sniffs each and says: “Oh, I wish you could smell this.” Then she starts undoing her blouse and adds: “And I wish you were here to carry on unbuttoning my shirt. See you soon.” She ends with the kiss. There is no indication the hostess sold either the video or the garments. But dozens of other cabin crew do sell such items online to boost their salaries.  Bids start at less than \u0026pound10 for a pair of used tights on eBay, with garments worn on long-haul flights fetching the highest prices from foot fetishists. A cabin crew source said: “It is well known for some staff to supplement their income by selling their old work clothes. A lot of us simply can’t live on the wages we’re paid. “The longer the flight the more people seem willing to pay for them. Sometimes they go for \u0026pound50. I heard one girl got \u0026pound80.”  In the ads, sellers hide their faces and do not disclose which airlines they fly for. But they post photos of their stockinged feet and legs aboard planes to prove they are genuine. One ad for used tights says: “Worn on long haul flight to Bangkok and back 24+ hours. Laddered slightly.”  Another offers a pair “worn on two long haul flights.” A third advertises “longhaul USA Singapore Argentina. Worn. Used. Sealed in an airtight bag.” Some sellers say the hosiery has been washed to “eBay standards” – but some follow the claim with a winking emoji or invite users to message them directly for “more details” or “extras”.

He said: “There was a lot of conflicting information from ticket vendors and promoters and that’s when I saw the opportunity. “You look at almost every market globally and there is a billion pound aggregator, so if you are booking a flight you would use Skyscanner, hotels maybe Trivago or car rentals would be Rentalcars. We couldn’t believe that there wasn’t already a local or global firm filling that gap in the market so that’s when we decided to join forces on TickX. I bought a sports car instead of going to university The 26-year-old knew he had the business development and sales expertise but was lacking in the product and tech experience - which is where Coley excels. Having grown up on the west coast of Scotland, 25-year-old Coley admits being obsessed with technology and business from a young age.  “It started off with selling toys to my friends and then chewing gum at school to learning about tech and teaching myself to code. “When I was a bit older I set up an online auction site from my bedroom to sell boats called Bid Marine.” Calling it an ‘unbelievable learning curve’ the youngster headed off to Harvard University for work experience before setting up a software development company aged 15. “I started building websites for local businesses and that grew into app development and big scale projects like cloud software.” However, when his youth became a barrier to getting larger projects, the enterprising youngster took an office in the local town and employed his father. Defying expectations he turned down a place at university to focus on the company and fondly remembers buying his first sports car as his friends settled into student life. Starting up TickX Interested by Pearce’s concept for a ticketing comparison site, the pair set out to build a one-stop destination to discover what events were happening, who was selling tickets and at what price. “While Sam was building the platform on evenings and weekends I was going out and bringing on board ticket partners,” says Pearce. Once the product was built and they started getting traction the founders knew it was time to ‘put their foot on the gas.’ “We believe that fortune favours the bold so we wanted to give it a good shot.” This turned out to be very true as they managed to get Ministry of Sound on board after a cold call.  “It was their first ever tech investment and it was a huge stamp of validation for us having one of the biggest independent record labels in the world back TickX,” he added. Coley chips in brightly: “It allowed us to jump that stage of credibility which a lot of small companies struggle with. People instantly took notice and the name had a massive impact.” Now the platform pulls in 125,000 events from more than 75 ticket partners and prioritises them in order of cheapest first. Last year they sold more than \u0026pound4m of tickets and are on track to grow that significantly. In fact, they have set their sights on building it into a billion pound business here in Manchester. Coley explains: “The opportunity there is massive. Globally it is about \u0026pound160bn a year on experience spend - in the UK it’s \u0026pound7bn all in. “It’s a huge market and if we nail it then it is a massive opportunity - that’s why we are excited and why the investors are excited.” Turning down the Dragons Another reason people have been taking notice is their appearance on BBC hit programme Dragons’ Den where the duo audaciously turned down \u0026pound75,000 investment from three dragons. Filmed in May 2016, Pearce recalls: “We never applied to go on to the show. The researchers actually reached out to us after the Manchester Evening News featured TickX in a top start-ups list.” His business partner says: “As we were already trying to raise investment we had the research to hand on what the problem was and how it needed fixing - so we got invited to audition and two weeks later we were pitching to the dragons.” Comparing it to an ‘intense boxing match’ Coley also praised it as ‘an unreal experience’ - although they didn’t expect to be in the pitch for an hour and a half.  “It was pretty surreal because we had both watched the show since we were young and then to find ourselves in the den was crazy.” This intensified as Nick Jenkins, the founder of online greeting card retailer Moonpig, Touker Suleyman and entrepreneur Peter Jones made them offers. However, the pair felt what they were asking for in equity undervalued the business. “We made the brave, or stupid, decision to decline them,” smiles Pearce. “Actually, we realised there are other people out there who can add value to the business and once they were excited about TickX we could find the capital externally.” This risk paid off, literally, as they ended up raising ten times more than what they had asked for in the den. The \u0026pound750,000 funding round was led by 24 Haymarket giving access to a syndicate of industry leaders and high net worth individuals. They also got some investment from Nick Ferguson, the former chairman of BskyB, and tech innovator Stan Boland, who is devising a self driving car. “We were a young team at the time and we just decided to surround ourselves with the best investors, backers and advisors,” remembers Pearce. His business partner agrees emphatically. “We really want to build an A-class team so the first part of that was getting good investors on board including Tim Chambers, the former Ticketmaster executive, who probably had the best industry knowledge you could ask for.” And this desire to pull in the right mix of investors and business leaders has paid off for the team. “The advice for any young entrepreneur starting in businesses is just to really get out there and get meeting people,” explains Pearce. “Also an investor isn’t always what you think an investor is - one of ours is someone I previously worked with. I think it\u0027s important to remember that people invest in an idea and the team which will deliver it.” A second round of funding led by venture capitalists BGF Ventures raised \u0026pound3m and will help accelerate their push into Europe. So where is TickX today? The growth has been pretty significant from a few hundred users when they first launched in the UK to more than one million last year. And the only way is up after expanding into new territories, including Ireland and the Netherlands. Not to mention running the ticketing site for NME. So how does it work? TickX is not a ticket selling platform - instead it helps people discover what is happening and to go out more to live events. I find the co-founders are genuinely passionate about this - and albout making sure people don’t get ripped off. The model works as TickX receives a commission from the ticket partner’s booking fee, making them an additional marketing channel to help reach a wider audience and drive up ticket sales. TickX\u0027s audience is a very big mix, the paper reports. “We started off focusing on the student market,” says the Manchester graduate. “Then it was young professionals with gigs before we started to see the huge potential in theatre with high order values and commission.” Coley agrees: “Our vision has changed a lot over the last three years. “We started off by focusing on events and now we really see the whole ‘experience market’. “People are looking to spend less money on things and more on going out and experiencing the world. That’s why the market is exploding. “It’s not just about the Instagram story, people don’t want disposable things any more - they want these experiences.” TickX are looking to innovate around this, launching a cinema offering this month and also building on their tech capabilities.

Some of the other holidaymakers - including children - were even in tears when the budget airline made the announcement at the airport last night, reports Belfast Live .  And Cornelia Dalipe and 15-year-old Erin admit they were even more bewildered to find police waiting outside as crew were led out a separate door. EasyJet has since apologised for the crew issue. Cornelia said: We couldn\u0027t believe what we were being told. There are many people who work 12-14 hour shifts and just get on with it. The pair from West Belfast were among the 146 holidaymakers looking forward to arriving in Palma on EasyJet flight 6711.  Cornelia claimed they were left stranded at Belfast International Airport when the 8.45pm flight was cancelled around midnight. They were shocked to be told the cancellation was because staff were too tired to go on. Cornelia said there was a police presence in the hall when the passengers were informed they would not be flying after all. She claimed: Police were there even though there was no aggression from passengers and the crew was led out a separate door. She said they then faced another blow when they had to wait hours until 3am before taxis arrived to take them home. She added: There were babies crying and parents of children with special needs trying to find a solution. We all had to queue to be booked onto alternative flights and while we are hoping to fly on Monday night, another woman I was speaking to was in tears as the next available flight for her was Tuesday night, which is a big chunk out of a one-week holiday.  They could have offered to take us over to Majorca without catering so they could have taken turns to sleep. If that meant we were able to get away on our holidays I\u0027d say everyone would have been happy with that. Instead it seemed the flight returned to Palma empty of passengers. People work so hard to get their money together for holidays and look forward to it. Staff seemed fed up too and told us it was an ongoing issue. An EasyJet spokewoman apologised for the cancellation, which she confirmed was due to a crew issue.” She also confirmed there was a taxi delay, which she said was due to various events in the city. However, she insisted it was absolutely not the case that there were structural issues with the flight and said it was the only one cancelled this month.

People have been quick to point out that jerk seasoning doesn\u0027t typically go on rice - but chicken, fish and other meats. The TV chef has been accused of cultural appropriation by people on social media, including Labour MP Dawn Butler, the shadow women and equalities minister. She wrote on Twitter that the celeb\u0027s jerk rice is not OK and that his appropriation from Jamaica needs to stop, adding that jerk is not just a word you put before stuff to sell products.      She also wrote that Jamie Oliver should get a masterclass in jerk by Levi Roots, the creator of Reggae Reggae sauce. Jerk is a type of cooking that originates in Jamaica, where meat is dry-rubbed or marinated in a seasoning made up of all spice, scotch bonnets and other ingredients. People accused him of cultural appropriation because the ingredients aren\u0027t traditional. One Twitter user wrote: I was about to headbutt my desk over this tweet from Dawn Butler because most cultural appropriation brouhahas are nonsense.  Then I saw this description of Jamie Oliver\u0027s Jerk Rice. On what planet can garlic, ginger and jalapenos be described as Jerk?\u0027 Some people have been quick to jump to Jamie Oliver\u0027s defence: arguing that the UK is a multicultural country and cooking different cuisines isn\u0027t the same as cultural appropriation. One person tweeted: Now while I do think Jamie needs taking down a peg or three you\u0027re all getting very silly over this appropriation stuff. If no one cooked/ate food from other cultures in the world what a boring life we\u0027d lead.

But the former Hollywood lighting director has had no word as to whether his daughter is ready to meet him during the solo visit to see her mum. And royal sources have warned Thomas could put any chance of a resolution to their problems at risk if he carries on with his public outbursts and sniping at her and the royals. Meghan, 37, will fly to the US to see mum Doria Ragland on a personal holiday. Thomas, 74, lives 150 miles away across the border in Rosarito, Mexico. He and Meghan have not spoken since her wedding to Prince Harry on May 19, after his staged \u0026shypaparazzi photos scandal was exposed. A royal source said: “The past few weeks will no doubt have been \u0026shyincredible stressful for Meghan and no one wants this saga to continue for her. “Hopefully she can find some way of seeking a resolution with her father but going back to her roots for a few days is exactly what she needs right now.  “Time will tell what the process for any type of relationship may be but as long as they keep hurting her, it becomes more and more unlikely they will be able to have any type of relationship.” A source close to Prince Charles was yesterday quoted saying: “The prince will be very sympathetic towards Meghan and the difficult situation she is in. But I suspect the Queen will be rolling her eyes and thinking, ‘Crikey, what is going to become of all of this?’” Since the staged photos fiasco, Thomas has engaged in a series of \u0026shyexplosive tell-all interviews where he criticised the royal family, revealed \u0026shyintimate details of conversations with Harry and slammed his daughter’s “sense of superiority”. The latest in a string of outbursts came after he “reached his limit” and hit out at his daughter and declared: “You’d be nothing without me.” And he put the phone down on Harry when the prince told him: “If you’d listened to me none of this would have happened.” Despite the public ramblings that have left Meghan deeply embarrassed, Thomas is desperate for a reconciliation with her. He has said: “I love my daughter. I love Prince Harry. I wish them nothing but the best.”  And he yesterday admitted he had made a grave error of judgement in lying to Prince Harry about staging the photos before the Royal wedding. Thomas said: “I made a terrible mistake which I have paid for ever since.” The Mirror last month reported that senior royal aides have held at least three crisis meetings to discuss how to deal with his outbursts. And we also told how Thomas feared he would never see his daughter again because of the drama. Former actress Meghan will meet up with Doria for the first time since her wedding within days. It is thought she may schedule in a visit to Toronto, Canada to see close friends and former co-stars from the hit TV show Suits which she starred in from 2011 as Rachel Zane for six years. She has been in regular contact with Doria and best friend Jessica Mulroney and has taken their advice on what action to take as Thomas and his side of the family continue to embarrass her.  Fashion stylist Jessica and husband Ben, son of former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, live in Toronto and have been two of the duchess’ closest confidantes throughout her \u0026shyrelationship with Harry. Meghan made Jessica \u0026shyunofficial maid of honour and included all three of the couple’s children in the wedding. Harry is not expected to travel to the US with his wife. But it was reported yesterday that “early talks” have taken place about the couple attending a charity polo match in LA or Santa Barbara, California, as part of an \u0026shyAmerican tour next spring. The couple have a number of engagements planned around the UK in September before they embark on an \u0026shyinternational tour of Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand in October.

The retired Hollywood lighting director is also incensed by rumours that he is bitter that his daughter did not pay back thousands of dollars on her private education. Speaking from his home in Rosarito Beach, Mexico, the 74-year-old told the Mail On Sunday: I’ve given just three interviews but there are thousands of stories circulating out there and it’s not right that people should be allowed to make up lies and get away with it. I’ve read stories saying I’m a drug addict or alcoholic. I don’t understand where these stories come from. I’ve taken pills when I’ve been in pain but I’ve never abused drugs.  You couldn’t move in Hollywood in the 1980s [when he worked there] without seeing bowls of cocaine everywhere. But I don’t do drugs and I barely drink. As well as the rumours about addiction, Markle also denied stories that he did not attend Meghan’s 2011 wedding to Hollywood director Trevor Engelson, who she divorced just two years later. While photos from the ceremony in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, show the couple exchanging vows on the beach and Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, swimming in the sea, Mr Markle is not visible in any of the pictures. However he reasons that the lack of photos of him at the wedding was because he was well into his 60s and not much into frolicking.  He added that he was present at the ceremony and walked Meghan down the beach with Doria, with 100 other guests also attending. Markle said that while he does have photos of him and his daughter at her first wedding, he chooses not to share them as he feels that it would be in poor taste and would be offensive to Prince Harry. The entire resort had been booked out, and Markle said he contributed to the costs by selling Facebook shares at a low price in order to help out financially. He said: I don’t regret it in the slightest because I was happy to help out, but that stock would be worth a fortune now. I’m not broke, I’m not bitter and I never expected Meghan to pay me back for anything. I was happy as a father to give her a great education. I was happy to provide the best start in life to all my children. Of course I never expected her to pay me back for her schooling.  Meghan has not spoken to her father since Prince Harry phoned him in hospital following his heart attack days before the Royal Wedding on May 19. It has been reported that Harry scolded him during the phone call for working with the paparazzi over staged pictures including one where he was being measured for a wedding suit. During the call, Harry scolded him for co-operating with paparazzi over staged pictures, including one of him apparently being measured for a wedding suit. Mr Markle does still hope for a reconciliation with his daughter and if this were to happen, it could come in February.

Researchers found two thirds have no idea the world is made up of seven land masses, with one in four wrongly believing there are only five. And three per cent - or the equivalent of 1.5m people - even think Great Britain is its own continent. Another one in four don’t know Antarctica is home to the south pole. The poll was commissioned by British Airways Holidays as A level and GCSE students receive their results. But despite 63 per cent of adults describing themselves as ‘well-travelled’, visiting an average of nine countries each, just one third reckon they would pass GCSE geography if they were to take the exam now.   The study also found 54% of Brits admit their knowledge of world locations, capital cities or landmarks is ‘ok’ or ‘poor’. Almost one quarter think the most commonly spoken language in Brazil is Spanish, rather than the correct answer of Portuguese. And one in four are unable to name the Sahara Desert as the largest hot desert in the world. Sixty-three per cent have no idea there are 50 stars on the US flag and more than one in 10 struggle to name India as the home of the Taj Mahal. And one tenth also think the Canadian city of Toronto is a US state and the same number pin pointed Athens as the home of the famous colosseum instead of Rome. But when it comes to capital cities, Brits do a little better with 78% able to identify Copenhagen as the capital of Denmark and 85% correctly naming Washington D.C as the US capital.  The research polled 9,000 adults from 13 countries, including the US, France, Germany, Russia, Brazil and Australia. One in four Australians struggle to name the Colosseum’s home as Rome, while almost one in five of French respondents and one in 10 Italians aren’t aware their home countries are part of the Alps. Only 54 per cent of Australians correctly said Budapest was the capital of Hungary, whereas UK based respondents fared better with 66 per cent selecting the correct answer. Six in 10 Germans could name India as the home of the Taj Mahal, yet a third of Russians don’t know Brazil’s language is Portuguese.

Kate Jones, 35, went into hospital thinking she would be home to give her children their tea. But crucial errors by doctors triggered two cardiac arrests and she died as her husband Stewart sat in the waiting-room expecting to take her home. He only found out something had gone disastrously wrong when a panicked nurse rushed in asking him for the names of their children - in a bid to get his wife to focus and cling on to life. Shortly afterwards a doctor informed him the simple outpatient procedure had gone so disastrously wrong his wife had tragically died. Mr Jones, 48, said: It was the most horrendous thing. I took my wife to hospital for this test which we thought was perfectly safe and I went home a widower.  The hospital still haven\u0027t apologised or even held their hands up and admitted liability and that has been especially hard. It has made everything so much worse. Now he has been awarded \u0026pound700,000 in an out-of-court settlement after a five year legal battle that has left him furious and demoralised with the NHS. Like thousands of others Kate, a highly-regarded beautician who worked for Virgin Atlantic, needed an angiogram to check for narrowing of the arteries. Though she was slim and healthy, she took statins to control high cholesterol levels - a condition which ran in her family. But after suffering a slight heart palpitations she was referred for an angiogram at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex. She and her husband were told it was a routine test carried out as an out-patient. On the NHS Choices website it is described as a generally safe and painless procedure. Mrs Jones went for the angiography on October 30 2013, thinking she would be in hospital for a couple of hours and home later the same day. The nightmare that followed is indelibly etched on her husband\u0027s mind. He said: She went in feeling a bit nervous but safe in the knowledge it was straightforward day-care procedure. Despite her very occasional heart murmur and high cholesterol, Kate was otherwise fit and full of life, always on the go and running around after the kids.  He drove her to the hospital and sat in the waiting room and the procedure began at about 11am. Mr Jones, is a manager at an electrical wholesalers who lives with their children Siena, 10, Lily, eight, Jaxon, six, in Stanstead Abbotts, Herts. He said: After an hour I saw staff come hurrying from the room looking panicked. It looked like they were running for help and then a specialist went into the room. I knew something had gone wrong but didn\u0027t know how dreadful it was until a nurse came out and asked me then names of our children. They wanted this to keep Kate focussed on her children and help her cling to life. I was in total shock. What had tragically occurred was a catalogue of blunders that began when the doctor tore an artery causing her to go into cardiac arrest. The torn artery was serious but not in itself fatal. However, despite the tear being seen, there was a delay of 15 crucial minutes before a heart specialist was called, causing the injury to worsen and Mrs Jones\u0027 condition to deteriorate. When the consultant arrived he inserted a guide wire to insert a stent which would have increased blood flow through the artery into the heart. But tragically the connector keeping the guide wire in place broke and, instead of leaving the wire in place and replacing the connector, the surgeon instead pulled the guide wire out meaning the stent could not be deployed. As a result Mrs Jones no blood was getting to the heart, she went into a second cardiac arrest and died at 1.30pm. Devastated and in shock, Mr Jones returned home to break the news to their children Siena, Lily, Jaxon, and Jake - her son from a previous relationship. He said: Kate was the love of my life. She was vibrant, caring and talented, with a unique sense of humour. She was so proud of her kids and she made a lasting impression on everyone who met her. I still find it hard to believe she\u0027s not here. Mr Jones is now the sole breadwinner and pays a nanny \u0026pound25,000 a year to look after his children while he is at work. The out-of-court settlement will help provide future financial security for them but came after a five year legal battle with the hospital.

Light is used to turn oxygen into killer cells that attack the antibiotic-resistant bacteria. And the method may even work on skin cancer, it is claimed. Researchers are using photosensitisers that contain metal \u0026shynanoparticles to target the MRSA, which kills hundreds of patients in Britain every year. Study chief Dr Peng Zhang said: “Instead of antibiotics, which no longer work against some bacteria like MRSA, we use photosensitisers, mostly dye molecules, that become excited when illuminated with light.  Then, the \u0026shyphotosensitisers convert oxygen into reactive oxygen species that attack the bacteria.” Dr Zhang, of the University of Cincinnati in the US, has a patent related to the design of hybrid photosensitisers, which can be formulated into a spray or gel. His team discovered that the \u0026shyphotosensitisers with the nanoparticle were more effective at killing a variety of bacteria than those without. He added: “If you want to attack a castle and you let people attack individually, it is not very effective. Instead, if you have the same number of people grouped together attacking the castle, it is possible to cause more damage.” "},{"url":null,"title":"night stalker obsessed burglar conor","story":"NewsNight Stalker-obsessed burglar Conor Ashton who targeted young women was school friend of double murdererEXCLUSIVE: The Mirror can reveal that Ashton - who admitted he was inspired by American Richard Ramirez - grew up just streets away from James Fairweather in Colchester, EssexShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByLouie Smith21:33, 19 AUG 2018NewsBurglar Conor Ashton targeted young women in terrifying raids (Image: SWNS- Cambridge)Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBurglar Conor Ashton, who targeted young women in terrifying raids after becoming obsessed with the Night Stalker serial killer, was at school with a double murderer. Ashton, 23, was jailed for 12 years last week after admitting burglaries inspired by American Richard Ramirez, who was known as the “Night Stalker”. Now we can reveal Ashton grew up streets from the double killer James Fairweather on the Greenstead Estate in Colchester, Essex. Fairweather was a 15-year-old schoolboy when he killed James Attfield, 33, in 2014, stabbing him 102 times. Three months later, Fairweather murdered Saudi student Nahid Almanea, 31, as she walked on a footpath just 200 metres from Ashton’s home. Both Ashton and Fairweather attended Colchester Academy, formerly Sir Charles Lucas Arts College. Friends say Fairweather was classmates with Ashton’s younger sister.  One former pupil said: “They were in school together and would have been walking the corridors at the same time. They certainly knew of each other.” Another former schoolmate added: “Greenstead is a big estate, but it’s the kind of place where everyone knows each other. “I’m not sure what went on to make those two boys from the estate the way they were. It’s quite upsetting that two such disturbed individuals have grown up round here.” Ashton’s crime spree began in December 2013 when he burgled a student house. His next burglary the following month happened within days of Fairweather’s first offence. Fairweather robbed his local Martin’s newsagent at knifepoint before going into school and showing the cigars he had stolen to pals. He killed his first victim in March, 2014, three days after youth court judges had decided not to jail him over the Martin’s raid.

The Duke of Edinburgh, 97, surprised his wife and other family members with the rare public appearance at Crathie Kirk church. It was his first public outing with The Queen, 92, since June. Prince Philip was snapped in the back of The Queen\u0027s royal Bentley for the short journey from their residence to the historic church in the large estate in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.  Zara and Mike Tindall, who welcomed their second daughter Lena on June 18, Camilla, and Prince Edward were among the other Royals present today.  It is understood Prince Philip has been enjoying fishing in the River Dee during his summer stay at Balmoral .  He has also been deer stalking and reportedly enjoying picnics and barbecues in the grounds.   Prince Philip had his hip replacement in King Edward VII Hospital in London earlier this year.  He retired aged 96 last year, having carried out more than 22,000 public engagements. It made Prince Philip one of the busiest Royals. Speaking to ITV in 2016, Princess Eugenie said her grandmother is most happy at Balmoral. She said: I think Granny is the most happy there. I think she really, really loves the Highlands…walks, picnics, dogs, a lot of dogs, there\u0027s always dogs, and people coming in and out all the time. Family-wise we\u0027re all there, so it\u0027s a lovely base for Granny and Grandpa to be - for us to come and see them up there where you just have room to breathe and run.

Britain’s worst female serial \u0026shymurderer – who helped her husband Fred rape their daughter, kill her and bury her under their patio – now goes to weekly chapel services. And the deluded monster, who blames her depraved hubby for \u0026shy“making me do things”, insists she will be at peace in an after-life. The astonishing revelations come from Catherine Jones, 52, who spent time in jail with Rose, 64. And they follow claims this week that more victims of Fred West are buried in Glasgow, where he lived before meeting Rose.  Catherine, 52, who was in HMP Low Newton, Co Durham, with Rose, told the Sunday People : “She really believes she’ll be forgiven when she dies.  “Will she? She put her own daughter under the patio.”  Rose’s religious confession came after she was asked: “What’s it like knowing you’ll be leaving this place in a wooden box?” Catherine said: “She came to me and my mates and said, ‘I’ve found a new life in God.’” Rose, who was convicted of ten murders including her daughter Heather, has embraced religion so firmly she visits the prison chapel every Sunday. But last night a close family member told the Sunday People: “We’re trying to move on and if Rose thinks that asking God to forgive her will in some way make up for what she’s done then that’s not a god that I would understand.  “There is nothing she can do that would put right what happened. “Really I think that it’s disrespectful to the families because they’re \u0026shynever going to get closure.” Fred and Rose killed, dismembered and buried young women and children at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester. Fred, 53, hanged himself in jail on New Year’s Day 1995 while awaiting trial for 12 murders between 1967 and 1987. Rose is serving a whole life tariff after being convicted in 1995. Ex-inmate Catherine, freed in June after serving 19 years for killing a man in Liverpool, said: “Rose blamed Fred for \u0026shyeverything. She said he bullied her and made her do things.”  Catherine gave a graphic description of Rose’s \u0026shybehaviour in Low Newton. She said: “Rose was the main woman in there but she did get stick because of who she is. “She was treated \u0026shydifferently. I’d say it was preferential treatment. The more \u0026shynotorious prisoners got that. Rose was clever, manipulative, clued up. That’s how she got favourable treatment. “She’d bake cakes for the girls. She was allowed to shower on her own, she didn’t have to go with everyone else. “We had ‘social’ every day where we would sit round smoking and chatting. Rose walked past and we shouted ‘Rose, give us a minute.’  “It was when she came over that someone said, ‘What’s it like knowing you’ll leave here in a wooden box?’ “That’s when she came out with all this stuff about ‘finding God’ and being ‘forgiven by God’ and ‘Fred made me do it.’ We couldn’t believe it. “She was blaming him but we all knew what she’d done. Rose does go to chapel every Sunday. She may be trying to find something by doing that but I don’t know what – after \u0026shyeverything she’s done.” Catherine said Rose was allowed her own area where she could do sewing. “It was her sewing room and she made a little tapestry for the door \u0026shysaying Threads Room. “But when she was away we messed about with it and changed it to Fred’s Room. “When she came back she just shook her head and took it down.  “Another time she was playing music in the cell. She was playing When Will I See You Again by The Three Degrees. “At the end of each chorus we were all shouting ‘Fred!’.” Catherine added: “She did get stick, but she was the main woman, she ruled the roost. I wasn’t intimidated by her like others. She knew I spoke my mind.” Catherine also spoke about Rose’s lesbian affairs. “She had a few girlfriends in there, different relationships. “She’d make cakes for the girls. She loved the kitchen, she used to eat a lot. She grassed me up once. I was banned from the kitchen but I snuck in to get some food and she grassed on me for it.” Catherine told how Rose tried to get all the TV sets removed when a \u0026shydocumentary about her horrific crimes was due to be screened. “She tried to get all the tellies turned off. It was because there was a \u0026shyprogramme on about her and Fred. “They wouldn’t do it and the next day she wouldn’t come out of her cell. “She didn’t want to talk to anyone because she knew we’d all been watching.” Catherine also told how Rose had “dead eyes”.  She said: “She walked round \u0026shylooking at the floor, not making eye contact. She had dark eyes. Most people have a little sparkle in their eyes, but hers were cold, dead.” Catherine, who was convicted with another person of robbing and killing a man in a B\u0026ampB, added: “I really regret what I was involved in. My family was gutted. “But Rose is totally \u0026shydeluded trying to blame Fred for everything.” This week calls were made to reinvestigate Fred’s life in Glasgow in the 1960s. Fred was working as a Mr Whippy ice-cream man when he ran over and killed a three-year-old boy in 1965. Paul Pender, a screenwriter who has researched Fred’s crimes, claims there is evidence that he deliberately hit the child. The author has been discussing the case with a man who worked in a Glasgow abattoir with Fred’s first wife Rena – \u0026shymurdered by Fred in 1971. Pender believes Fred used his shed at the allotment to have sex with girls after luring them into his ice-cream van. He also believes Fred learned butchery skill to dismember his victims’ bodies after visiting the abattoir where Rena worked. After leaving Scotland Fred returned to Gloucester, where he went on a murdering spree with Rose, whom he married in 1972.  Last night the Ministry of Justice \u0026shydeclined to comment.  Terror at 25 Cromwell St  Rose West murdered at least ten girls with her husband Fred, dismembering their bodies and burying them under their house of horrors at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester. Rose met Fred, who was 13 years older, at Cheltenham bus station when she was 15. Rose’s first murder, in June 1971, was Fred’s step-daughter from his first marriage, Charmaine, aged eight. At the time Fred was in prison for theft. A friend revealed when they visited the house Charmaine was standing on a chair with her hands tied behind her back with a belt. Rose was holding a large wooden spoon and about to hit her. She later said Charmaine had been naughty and had to be punished. After killing her, Rose told people she had “gone to live with her mother and bloody good riddance”. Another victim was daughter Heather, 16. The couple would tell their other children if they didn’t behave they would “end up under the patio like Heather”. Their sickening crimes began to unravel in 1992 when Fred was accused of raping his 13-year-old daughter. Shocked cops soon discovered the couple had been abducting girls from bus stops around Gloucester and holding them captive before killing them. Police discovered mutilated bodies buried in the garden and cellar of their home, which has since been demolished. Victims  1967: Ann McFall, Scottish nanny and Fred’s lover, eight months pregnant.    1970: Rena Costello, Fred’s first wife.   1972: Charmaine West, eight.    1973: Linda Gough, 21, seamstress from Gloucester.    1973: Lucy Partington, 21, university student.   1974: Carol Cooper, 15, from Worcester.    1975: Juanita Mott, 19, of Newent, Glos.    1975: Shirley Hubbard, 15, from Worcester.    1977: Therese Siegenthaler, 21, Swiss hitchhiker.    1977: Alison Chambers, 17, from Swansea.    1978: Shirley Robinson, 18, Fred’s pregnant lover.   1987: Heather West, 16, eldest daughter.

Writing in the Sunday Times , he said: I\u0027m putting some of my money behind the People’s Vote campaign because I know we have a genuine chance to turn this around.

The money will be spent on a detailed polling exercise, which he hopes will give Remainers confidence when asking for another public vote. Dunkerton claims that if Brexit happened 20 years ago, his brand would never have been a success. Unsurprisingly, the move has public opinion divided on social media. Some Leave voters have criticised the donation as an example of the rich using wealth to influence democracy and want to boycott the brand, while some Remainers back his support for the People\u0027s Vote - and believe the public having a say on the deal in such an uncertain political climate.

Savvy Clair Hughes, 30, started researching ways to save money as a way of getting out of her \u0026pound3,500 overdraft. During her search, Clair, from Bury, Greater Manchester, stumbled upon a \u0027couponing\u0027 community online - and was hooked. Clair now estimates she’s saved “easily over \u0026pound15,000” - and even managed to put down a deposit to buy a three-bed semi-detached house with her partner, Shane Byrne, also 30. Revealing how she never pays full price for an item anymore, thrifty Clair, who works in a local school, said: “It’s become a running joke with my friends. Every time we go out, they’ll ask if I have a voucher – and I always do. “Discounts are always there to be had, it’s just a matter of being organised.  “Before I started this, I thought it’d be so much work, but now I’m so used to this lifestyle that it’s automatic to me. I must have saved easily over \u0026pound15,000.” Clair’s mind first turned to money saving back in 2010, when she moved in with Shane, a phone company trainer. Having recently graduated from Edge Hill University, near Wigan, where she studied drama and physical theatre, she’d maxed out her \u0026pound3,500 student overdraft – and felt the interest repayments were just “money down the drain.” After taking to the web for advice, she tried out a few clever money saving tricks like switching her overdraft to a zero-interest account. Then, a few years later, she came across an online community for “couponers” and decided to give it a go.  She started spending hours trawling the web for money off vouchers or discount codes, printing them all out to take with her whenever she went shopping. “It would initially take a couple of hours to get organised,” she said. “I’d go on supermarket websites to look through what I’d need in a shop, making a note of anything on offer, or anything I had a coupon for. “Eventually though it becomes second nature and you can do it in around half an hour.” Over the years, the coupon queen has managed to nab some impressive hauls. Two lamps worth \u0026pound140 cost her just \u0026pound35, and because she learnt buying in bulk is usually cheaper, she scored six months worth of dog food for her Pomeranian Poppy for a mere \u0026pound9. Around two years ago, Clair also began using cashback apps and websites where you are given money back on items ranging from beers to toiletries.  After each shop, she uploads pictures of her receipts, which are then scanned, and money is given back on certain items. “I’ve saved hundreds through that alone,” said bargain-mad Clair. “You can get cashback on most things, and it’s all something I’d have been buying anyway. If something is totally free, I always make sure I get it regardless of whether I’ll use it, as I can donate it to a charity or foodbank. “But with cashback, I make sure it’s worth my while.” Among her other top saving tips, Clair recommends taking part in paid online surveys, which have earned her hundreds in high street vouchers, hitting the shops at certain times of the day to take advantage of reduced ‘yellow sticker’ stock, signing up to receive trials or tester products or trawling cosmetics counters for freebies. She added: “I have managed to get a lot of freebies by messaging or writing to companies to compliment them on their products. People always assume you get freebies for complaining – but it pays more to be nice.  “I’ve heard a lot about a practice called wombling too, which is basically collecting other people’s discarded receipts from shopping trolleys to check for missed discounts. I’d love to give it a try but there doesn’t seem to be a receipt to be found at my local supermarket.” Having set herself the goal of owning a home by the time she was 30, Clair - who has set up an Instagram dedicated to sharing her thrifty pearls of wisdom - was delighted to exchange just five days shy of her landmark birthday. And now, after Shane proposed to her on his birthday earlier in August, she is looking ahead to planning the ultimate shoestring wedding.

To this day police still don\u0027t know whether the 9lb baby died of natural causes or if she was victim of something more sinister.  Investigators said back when the tiny body was found 16 years ago that whoever was responsible for abandoning it must have been a local as the spot along the River Teign could only have been found by someone who knew it was there, reports Plymouth Herald .  Named by police as Amanda, which means worthy of love, the newborn child with a mass of black hair was discovered by local fisherman Barry Kingwell at Arch Brook Creek on the Teign estuary near Coombe Cellars, South Devon, in September 2002.  He was checking his crab pots at around 8am, when he spotted a sack in the reeds. Inside the sack was a dark-haired, baby girl. The baby had been wrapped in a man-made white hessian sack, which had been placed into a similar larger bag. Both bags were weighed down with a house brick. A post-mortem examination revealed that the 9lb baby was born alive and healthy. Nobody knows if she was dead when she was left in the creek or if she was left there to die. Despite numerous police appeals, no parents or relatives were found.  But a DNA sample was taken from Amanda’s tiny body and through careful examination of the site where she was found and material discovered, police have been able to establish a full DNA profile of the mother. To identify the parents, police needed a friend, relative or anyone who has the remotest suspicion to get in touch. Nobody came forward. To this day the case remains a mystery. A year after the shocking discovery, the people of Teignmouth and police who worked on the investigation remained incredibly moved by the sad discovery. As a mark of respect they installed a marble plaque in tribute to the mystery infant, who medical experts say died within days of her birth. Standing beside the plaque inscribed with the words: “A tiny flower lent not given, to bud on earth and bloom in heaven”, Detective Sergeant Ken Lamont, who led the investigation, said he hoped the tribute to the baby might prompt someone to break their silence.  Sadly, it didn\u0027t. To this day nobody knows if the baby died by natural causes or was left to die. Speaking 15 years ago DS Lamnont said: “While the case remains in the public domain there is always a chance of the mother or someone with knowledge of the matter to come forward. “But at such a time we thought that a headstone or plaque would be a fitting end to this tragic incident. “It is unusual to have a common grave marked, although Teignbridge District Council felt the tragedy had affected the hearts and minds of the local community and were happy to allow the erection of the memorial.” He added: “We still do not know yet whether this baby died out of natural causes or whether it was something more sinister, but so far all of our leads to find the mother, father or a relative, have turned out negative. Police were convinced that the mother and father lived locally.  They said that the spot on the River Teign where the body was found would be difficult to find unless you knew it was there and said that the bags could only be bought by local people. “Concealed births are very common but this is very rare as where the baby was deposited is not easy to get to and the mother would not have been able to get there on her own,” said DS Lamont. “It is likely that a third party was involved. But we need to find out what happened. “It could be that the mother was very vulnerable and unaware of what was happening in the birth process itself and unknown to her, or it could be that she is a juvenile who did not know which way to turn.

Forecasters say there is “huge uncertainty” with large parts of the UK facing the possibility of unsettled wet weather or a return to heatwave conditions. Yesterday, the remnants of Storm Ernesto swept across the UK bringing heavy rain to many parts of the country. As it crossed the Azores the Atlantic storm brought winds of 45 mph but slowed as it reached our shores.  This week will see the warm weather return with temperatures reaching the high 20C’s in the south east on Tuesday and Wednesday. The weather will remain rather cloudy in the north-west with rain. On Thursday, fresher conditions with showers in the north, rain for central parts.  But another weather front heading in from the Atlantic on Friday has the potential to bring in heavy rain over the long weekend break, particularly in south Wales and south west England. Met Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern said: “Computer simulations are picking up on something that is just happening thousands of miles away over to the west of the North American continent. “The south ridge in the jet stream here could start to happen and if that happens then it will have big downstream consequences on the weather at home because this ridge will then ripple all the way across North America, the north Atlantic and then under close to the UK. “If we end up on the south of this ridge we will have similar weather to what we had earlier in the summer – the heatwave, the dry, the heat, the high pressure.

After a brief respite and some very welcome rain, the country will return to more humid, muggy weather in the run-up to the last Bank Holiday weekend of the year. Monday will begin with sunny spells in Scotland and northern England. Central areas will see spots of rain with cloud building in the north and rain spells expected after 12pm. But the Met said they won’t be “long-lived or heavy”, and that light winds will bring temperatures in the north to 22C and 26C in the south.   Yet the cooler weather isn’t bound to last long as the Met Office said it will be “quite humid and muggy through Tuesday and Wednesday”.  Highs of 26C are expected in the north, while the south may reach 27C or 28C depending on the sunshine. Londoners are also set for another 25C heatwave on Wednesday, but the Met said it’ll feel fresher because of rain, before it cools down to 20C on Friday.  It comes after the UK was battered by Storm Ernesto over the weekend, with the north being the worst hit and the Met forecasting up two-and-a-half inches of rain.     Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said: “Ernesto’s warm and humid air stays here for the first half of the week, with 26-28C from Monday to Wednesday in the South, with mainly dry weather for most. “A cold front brings rain on Thursday, but the Bank Holiday weekend looks relatively warm at 23C and a degree or two warmer not ruled out. “The South will be mainly dry, and the North still seeing good sunny spells, but less settled.” UV levels will be high or moderate across the country, while pollen levels will remain low. Summer 2018 has a chance of ending up the warmest on record for the UK, with the race for the top spot wide open, according to the Met Office.

Finally the weapons spins dramatically through the air. Near the end of the video, the youth is seen throwing another bystander onto a car.  Then one of the group places the knife safely back in the scabbard. A second clip shows one of the men who helped holding his bleeding hand with a bandage.

Accountancy giant PwC charging up to \u0026pound1,156 an hour feels as excessive as the Unite union claims, especially when concerns about the company’s previous work were raised by MPs Frank Field and Rachel Reeves, joint heads of a Parliamentary inquiry that accused the auditor of a conflict of interest. Field’s dig that PwC had “every incentive to milk the Carillion cow dry” is reinforced by the eyewatering invoices. The insistence by a financial behemoth that the cost would otherwise be higher will only infuriate victims of a terrible corporate failure. Carillion was an ugly face of capitalism, run for the benefit of a few at the price of the many. PwC is not covering itself in glory.  Theresa May has not just abandoned a Tory promise to get rid of mixed sex hospital wards but gone in total reverse. Close on 15,000 patients had to share wards with the opposite sex last year, a betrayal of 2010 and 2015 Tory manifesto promises. Uncaring May does not seem to care about stripping NHS patients of their privacy. What might be acceptable occasionally in exceptional emergencies is not OK when it happens because of poor management or because austerity cuts have forced hospitals to shed beds. Until the Tories sort simpler problems such as the banning of mixed wards they have no chance of finding a cure for the bigger issues.

In truth I\u0027d never fancied it myself, but in 2018, Tinder and other apps, like Bumble, seem to be the way to meet people. Personally I prefer talking to faces instead of typing on a screen - and there\u0027s something that\u0027s quite scary about the idea of meeting someone that you\u0027ve never met in person. But I downloaded it in an attempt to see what the modern world of dating is really like, and recounted the experience on Wales Online.  As little as two weeks ago, I thought Tinder was rife with people sending unwanted explicit images, flirting and basically finding people to have sex with. But apparently it\u0027s not (just) about that. Still, all over the internet, there are horror stories about people\u0027s experiences. One woman described being sent a picture of a penis with a measuring tape next to it by a guy she met, another described being given chlamydia by a guy who she later found out was already in relationships with two other women. In Wales, a would-be consultant harassed a woman he met on Tinder, sending her emails and hacking her Facebook account . While cases like this may be rare (at least, I hope they are), there\u0027s still good reason to be wary and it was hard to go into this with confidence. But at least you can\u0027t send pictures on the app. I found this out from a fellow user about an hour after downloading it - for that to happen I would have to add them on another form of social media such as Snapchat or Instagram . Sweet joy! I did not have to put myself through seeing genitals of various shapes and sizes for the purpose of this experiment. Saying that, the fear soon upped when I accidentally super-liked about three people in the space of the first hour. Not ideal.  From the get-go I knew I was never going to meet up with anyone - but as soon as I started swiping I could see what to avoid: 1. People without profile pictures. Why would you not show your face? 2. People with odd profile pictures. I saw everything from a set of sex toys to a quote that read \u0027I want to do bad things to you\u0027 to a chicken nugget. An actual chicken nugget. None of which encouraged me to swipe right. 3. People who had their hands down their pants in pictures. 4. People who are open about wanting hook-ups in their bios. If you like a six pack - you\u0027ll see a lot of them on Tinder. There are a lot of guys who post topless pictures of themselves or snaps of them working out at the gym. A lot also posted selfies with their dogs (I know what you\u0027re trying to do!) and kids, before quickly pointing out they were their nephews or nieces (Hey, I love kids but I don\u0027t have any of my own). During my short stint, I had one or two requests to add guys on Instagram but I gracefully declined. What I found more intriguing is that a lot of people don\u0027t actually talk on Tinder.

Chris Watts, 33, will face court on Monday charged with murdering daughters Bella and Celeste and wife Shanann. She was 15-weeks pregnant with a baby boy that they were going to name Nico.  Last week he sobbed on TV as he appealed for the return of the trio before allegedly confessing he had killed them. The bodies were found on the property of Anadarko Petroleum, one of Colorado\u0027s largest oil and gas drillers where Watts worked.  Body language experts who closely studied the recordings of the interviews believe that it was apparent that the \u0027killer\u0027 dad was lying.  Lillian Glass told HollywoodLife that Watts\u0027 dishonesty was evident as he spoke too much and was giving out too much information.   She said: He is shrugging his shoulders, which shows he was lying. He smiles and chuckles during the plea, which is very contrived and also reveals he is being fake. Glass adds that Watts, who was arrested on Thursday was showing inappropriate facial responses. He has his arms crossed at one point. The bottom line is, he’s closing off because he knows he’s done something bad. Shanann, 34, Bella, 4, and Celeste, 3, were reported missing on Monday by Watts who made a tearful TV plea to find them.  But things took a sinister turn when he allegedly confessed to killing them. Court papers state that he strangled his two kids before hiding their bodies in oil tanks and burying their mother in a shallow grave.  Prosecutors said they believe the family were murdered in the family home and the bodies were later moved. Police are remaining tight lipped about the cause of death and whether the children were still alive when Shanann was killed. It has also emerged how Shanann had express concerns to her friends that her husband was being unfaithful to her.  Shanann was reported missing on Monday after returning home from a business trip at around 1am. Watts had spent the weekend at home with their children. Chris said he last saw his wife at 5.15am before he left for work.  Speaking on NBC\u0027s Today show , Watts said he and Shanann had had an emotional conversation that morning and had stayed up talking but didn\u0027t give any further details.  He said: I don\u0027t feel like this is even real right now. It\u0027s like a nightmare I can\u0027t wake up from. He said Shanann was planning to go to a friend\u0027s house with their daughters and Fox 31 reports that was the last time he heard from her.

It is said to have jolted buildings on the island and further significant damage is expected. Just 30 minutes later a 5.9 tremor struck. An earthquake earlier this month killed hundreds.

Email webnews@trinitymirror    Other terrified witnesses have reported mudslides. No injuries or fatalities have so far been reported after the latest jolts, but aftershocks have been felt right across the Indonesian islands, including popular tourist destination Bali. Holidaymakers said on Twitter they have felt worried and fear for their safety. Footage shared online shows tourists pouring out of their hotels and into streets as they felt the jolt.  Lombok was hit by an number of aftershocks which caused further trauma and panic for those who lost loved ones or their homes in the disaster earlier this month, as terrified people ran into the streets fearing their homes would fall on top of them. Last month\u0027s massive earthquake killed at least 347 people and put the island on the verge of a humanitarian crisis. More than 13,000 homes collapsed or were badly damaged. The tremor was strong enough to rock the neighbouring island of Bali, which is visited by thousands of British tourists every year. The scale of the earthquake was so big that neighbouring Australia was issued a tsunami watch warning for parts of its western coast.  Holidaymaker Charlotte Neal, who was in Ubud, said: “We were travelling in the car in a narrow side street when people started running from shops and shouting. Our driver was Balinese and told us they were shouting ‘earthquake’. “He turned the engine off and we felt the car shake for about 10 seconds, before calming again.

I complicate my game sometimes but I’m working on just playing it simple and that’s what the gaffer and (assistant manager) Laurie Ellis want me to do.“They stress to me I have to play it simple at times and then do the magic when I can.”Not that it’s an easy process and Glass admits when he’s on the pitch he wants to be involved at the sharp end, doing the things that help win games.“I like to create chances and I really love to get shots in on the goal, it’s what my game is about.“I’m an attacking player and I like to excite but you can’t always do that and sometimes it is about keeping things simple and doing it for the team.”As those words show, this is a young man who does not lack confidence in his own ability but he’s also one who gives an honest assessment of his performances.For instance, while he was delighted to have played his part in a young United line-up that battled back from two goals down to beat St Johnstone’s U/21s in the Betfred Cup on Wednesday night, he was far from completely satisfied with his work.“It was a brilliant result, all the boys worked really hard to come from two behind like we did.“Obviously, the experienced players helped us a lot but I thought the young boys, including myself, dug in and we battled and battled.“St Johnstone were no mugs and I thought they really impressed so it was good to get on top of them by the end.“I know I wasn’t at my best but, like all the boys, I dug in and helped get the result.“I was maybe trying too hard at times for the killer pass or maybe trying to shoot too early.“Sometimes things don’t come off on the park but I still worked hard and helped the team and that’s what you have to make sure you do.”As he keeps grafting towards making the breakthrough in the first team on a regular basis, Glass was delighted by the victory, not least because it means there will be further opportunities to show he is ready.“This cup is a chance to get 90 minutes and, if I’m not playing in the league, I need to get games somewhere.“If it’s in the Irn-Bru Cup it’s better for me and the other boys, because they are very competitive, like league games.“You want to win them, both teams do, and it gives you the chance to show up well.“We want to do well in it and I think we can.“I thought our fitness was a big factor against St Johnstone.“We had a hard pre-season and I think we got the benefits of that against St Johnstone because we finished the game strongly and looked the fitter team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b76e6a876773.jpg ","title":"dundee woman louise can wed in style after winning tele competition","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA bride-to-be will walk down the aisle in style thanks to the Evening .Louise McDonald, 22, from Charleston, was named the winner of our Wed in Style competition during the Scottish Wedding Directory’s fashion show, held at DCT Media’s Meadowside HQ.Tele readers were invited to collect points in an innovatve fruit machine- style competition which used digital technology to create tens of thousands of unique gamecards.Louise topped the list of five finalists to win a Justin Alexander gown worth up to £1,500, sponsored by Alison Kirk Bridal, kilts for fiance Graeme Boyd and five groomsmen courtesy of Kilthire Company and her carriage for the big day in the shape of a classic vintage car, sponsored by the Lovely Wedding Car Company.She said she was “in total shock” after discovering she had won the big prize.“I’m over the moon.

He says, though, coming off was just a precaution after needing surgery on the same ankle last season.He said: “It was nothing too serious. I had a shot and rolled my ankle a bit and I’ve had previous with it, so it was a bit of a worry at the time. However, a good bit of rest and the physio saw it. I’ve trained this week and it’s good. I just need to keep an eye on it.”Now would be an unfortunate time for Spence to be ruled out of action after some impressive displays in the early-season games and particularly due to the level of competition in the position now at Dens Park.“Last year there were a lot of centre-mids but again this year we’re very strong there, one of the strongest areas in the team,” he added.“I think that’s good because it keeps everyone on their toes, you can’t slack because there will be somebody else to take your place.“I believe in my ability and I’ve worked hard over the summer, worked hard in pre-season, too.“Obviously, I’ve been in the position but Glen Kamara is to come back and you’ve got Adil Nabi, Paul McGowan, Elton Ngwatala and Kharl Madianga, so there’s a lot of competition in there. I think throughout the season it will be getting rotated round and, hopefully, I can be in that team.“I think I’ve done OK so far. It’s still early but I want to keep this up through the whole season.“Last year I played well in stages and then got injured so I want to play consistently every week, play as much as I can, and obviously help the team climb the table.”And the way to do that will be to start finding the net, something Spence is adamant that’ll change soon.“I think our luck will turn around.“We have to put some of these chances away, we all know that, but the main thing is we are creating chances.“One day it is going to click, something is just missing at the moment but we all believe in the guys up front to go and do it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/Weather-girls-stars-in-their-eyes.jpg.jpg ","title":"tonight matthew starz in thir ehs set to play in caird hall for final time","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDozens of headline acts – including “Tina Turner” and “Bruce Springsteen” – could be set to play at the Caird Hall for the final time next month.For the past eight years, amateur performers – including a number of Dundee City Council employees – have been disappearing behind the curtain and re-emerging as their celebrity alter egos for Starz In Thir Ehs.As the name suggests, the show is a homage to the much-loved TV show Stars in Their Eyes.Presented by Matthew Kelly, the show entertained prime-time Saturday night TV audiences for nearly two decades until it was cancelled in 2006 – and Starz in Thir Ehs has continued that tradition.Ron Whyte, of Stage 1 Theatre Company, said this year’s cast members are making the final preparations for the show which takes place on Thursday September 6.He said: “We’ve been doing this show for the last seven or eight years.“It started off with employees from the social work department at Dundee City Council and the cast has grown from there.”Formed in 1994, the theatre company has helped to raise more than £50,000 for local charities through performances, including the Starz In Thir Ehs shows.But audiences numbers have dwindled in recent years and Ron said next year’s show might have to be held at a smaller venue.Ron, from Douglas, added: “The show used to attract 800-900 people.“The numbers have gone down recently so it may well be the last time we decide to run the event in the Caird Hall.“We’ve got Bruce Springsteen playing this year as well as Kenny Rogers and Belinda Carlisle.“The show always went down well and we had great audience participation.“Since we started more than 20 years ago we must have raised £50,000 for local charities.“If it is a case that this is the last time at the Caird Hall, I’m sure we’ll go out with a bang.”Tickets for the show are available from the Dundee Box Office.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"two motorists convicted of driving 52mph on the kingsway","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTwo men were convicted of speeding on the Kingsway.Brian Evans, 40, of Rosemount Road, was fined £100.Evans admitted that on February 15 this year, at the A90 Kingsway West at Charlotte Street, he drove at 52mph in the 40mph zone.Meanwhile, Kelly Green, 32, of Dales Road in Peterhead, was fined £120 at the Justice of the Peace court.Green admitted that on February 19 this year he drove at 52mph in the 40mph zone of Kingsway West at Charlotte Street.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck -

Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the under-performance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs.\"The CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.\"Retail workers trade union Usdaw says it is seeking \"urgent clarification\" from Homebase owner Hilco over its long-term plans for the firm.National officer Dave Gill said: \"All too often staff are excluded from the CVA process as the future of their jobs is being decided.\"Clearly there is a huge task ahead.

His only previous start was in the 1-0 win at Dundee last December, the game after he scored a superb free-kick in a 2-1 loss to Rangers.The Dons made their intentions clear straight from the kick-off when Gary Mackay-Steven found Stevie May with a cross from the right flank.Striker May fired off a 10 yard shot that keeper Craig Samson pushed wide for a corner.There were just nine seconds on the clock.Moments later midfielder Stephen Gleeson fired a 22 yard free kick over the bar.In the fifth minute the highly dangerous Mackay-Steven picked out Lewis Ferguson at the back post but his diving header was saved for a corner.Straight after Dominic Ball met a Frank Ross corner with a glancing header that Ferguson got a toe onto only to see the effort flash inches wide.Again in the 10th minute Mackay-Steven was provider when his drifted corner from the right found Mikey Devlin who headed across goal from 18 yards and wide.Aberdeen could, and should, have been two or three up inside the first 10 minutes.St Mirren finally mustered an effort in the 13th minute when Nicolai Brock-Madsen headed wide.Aberdeen\u0026#8217s deserved opener came in the 15th minute when a pass from Ferguson found MACKAY-STEVEN who took it on the volley.The winger smashed the ball into the ground from just inside the box and it bounced over keeper Samson.The Dons were tearing St Mirren apart.It was 2-0 in the 19th minute when the sensational Mackay-Steven raced past Hayden Coulson and captain Graeme SHINNIE powered in on the blindside at the back post to head in.St Mirren looked shell-shocked and were hugely fortunate to just be two goals down after only 20 minutes.The rout continued when it became 3-0 in the 26th minute when Wright pounced on a poor clearance from keeper SamsonHe rounded the keeper and then unselfishly squared a pass along the face of goal to Stevie MAY who clinically fired in from 12 yards.It was May\u0026#8217s first competitive goal for the Dons since a 4-1 win over St Johnstone on March 31.In the 36th minute Ball picked out Shinnie at the edge of the box and his dipping header went just over.Yet again Mackay-Steven was in the heart of the action when he skipped past Coulson then unleashed a low drive from 12 yards that keeper Samson did well to block at the near post.On the stroke of half-time Shinnie had a 12 yard drive blocked by Samson.It was the final action of a superb 45 minute shift from the Dons who received a deserved standing ovation from the Red Army at half-time.It was 4-0 in the 56th minute when Aberdeen were awarded a penalty when Mackay-Steven was taken down by Coulson as he attempted to step past him.The left-back had no answer for MACKAY-STEVEN who then stepped up to take the penalty \u0026#8211 and converted.In the 81st minute Shinnie curled a 22 yard shot inches wide of the far corner with keeper Samson beaten.Moments later teenage substitute Bruce Anderson volleyed from distance forcing keeper Samson to push wide.ABERDEEN: Lewis, Ball, Devlin, Considine, Shinnie, Gleeson, Ferguson, McGinn, Mackay-Steven, Wright, May.Subs: Forrester (for  Ross 60), Anderson (for Wright 70), McLennan (for May 80)Subs not used: Cerny,  Cosgrove, Campbell,  Roscoe.ST MIRREN: Samson, P.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tech savvy feis an tairbeirt gives musicians a professional edge","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 08/08/18, 7:29 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA Fèis an Tairbeirt workshop in music production, funded by Argyll and Bute Council\u0026#8217s Supporting Communities Fund, has been voted a success.Students recorded and produced their own tracks, created soundscapes with pre-recorded sounds, composed soundtracks and provided voiceovers for pieces of film and media during the three-day event.The chance to develop these skills is not usually offered outside of higher education but thanks to the knowledge and experience of tutor Luke Schofield, Fèis an Tairbeirt was able to offer this unique opportunity to local young adults.Another course has been arranged for September 15 and 16 and is limited to six places.The course is free but anyone interested should email feisantairbeirt@gmail to book a place.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK. The competition is free to enter and all shops who enter will also be promoted to consumers through an online Indie Retail Directory.Shopkeepers can nominate their businesses until Sunday September 9 via bestsmallshops. A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight. It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man. Greta Cameron talked about the early years of the Oyster Bar, established on the estate in the late 1970s by Christina\u0026#8217s brother Johnny Noble along with fish farmer Andy Lane.Piecing together records from her father\u0026#8217s journal, estate records and blending these with the recollections of the people of the estate, Christina has created a remarkable piece of work.This book is not just about the Nobles, but the Ardkinglas community, the people who make it and have made it and the story of how they lived and worked.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m very pleased that so many people have come along today for our launch party,\u0026#8217 said Christina.\u0026#8216Ardkinglas is a place that is very dear to me, and the place and the people have contributed to making me who I am today.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

The pitch at the school is too small to host even an under-13 game.‘For Mid Argyll Rugby Club to grow, it needs to have a home to create an identity. In recent years, plans and promises to create a rugby facility have always come to nothing and the game in Mid Argyll has suffered for it.\u0026#8216We have a Scottish School cup game on Tuesday August 28 and at the moment we are still looking for a venue. How can we compete with central belt schools, or even our neighbours in Oban, who have facilities provided by the council?’The club has steadily been developing fresh talent for more than five years, but with nowhere to play it cannot field a first 15 despite plenty of willing players.The pitch project, supported by Scottish Rugby and Argyll and Bute Rugby Development Officer Allan Wright, hopes to be open by autumn 2019.Another supporter of the project is Councillor Dougie Philand, who said: ‘I have been involved with senior rugby previously and having our own pitch was always a problem.\u0026#8216I would fully support any development or plans that would promote a permanent pitch and changing areas especially now when there is a resurgence in junior rugby. I would also be happy to be involved in any negotiations to obtain the land from the council.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scots guards colours go back to their argyll roots","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/08/18, 3:57 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe colours of a military regiment with deep connections to Inveraray are to be laid up in the Royal Burgh.The Scots Guards can trace their origins back to 1642 when, by order of King Charles I, the regiment was raised by Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll for service in Ireland, and was known as the Marquis of Argyll\u0026#8217s Royal Regiment.Later this month the old colours of the First Battalion Scots Guards will be laid up in a formal ceremony at Glenaray and Inveraray Parish Church.The battalion has seen service in all the major conflicts involving the British army since the Napoleonic Wars and the Scots Guards remain a first line infantry regiment of the British army.The church will be the home of the colours, and parish minister Reverend Dr Roderick Campbell said: \u0026#8216The laying up of colours happens roughly every 25 years for regiments of the line, but this will be the first time the Scots Guards has laid up old colours in Inveraray.\u0026#8217It is set to be a colourful occasion, with military top brass expected to join the Duke of Argyll, the Lord Lieutenant of Argyll and Bute and other dignitaries for the occasion.It will all happen at Glenaray and Inveraray Parish Church on Sunday August 26, with the service starting at 11.30am.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"jolomo exhibition opens at lochgilpheads archway gallery","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/08/18, 10:53 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead’s Archway Gallery opened a new exhibition on Saturday August 11 featuring the work of John Lowrie Morrison, commonly known as Jolomo.The exhibition, name Toward the Light, features familiar Arran and Kintyre seen in an unfamiliar view.The show is described on the Jolomo Facebook page as: ‘showing on home turf, John revisits some favourite places, but reveals them in a new light.’The exhibition was opened by Argyll and Bute MSP Mike Russell to an appreciative crowd who listened as John told tales of his artwork giving his own perception some light.Mr Russell said: \u0026#8216I was very honoured to be asked to open it and as ever bowled over by John’s artistry and his ability to express not just what he sees but what he feels.\u0026#8216I also like the slightly darker themes John has chosen this year – much more of sunsets and the ever changing light in the Kilbrannan Sound.\u0026#8217One visitor to the exhibition said: \u0026#8216It’s was amazing.

And he is well aware that Labour must recapture votes in places like the Doon Valley if it is to regain power at Holyrood and Westminster. “This is precisely the kind of constituency we need to win back,” admitted the Scottish Labour Party leader. He made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank. But time will tell whether or not this will bring voters back to the fold. Mr Leonard chatted amiably to lady volunteers at the Kirk Shop, in the middle of Dalmellington. There was clearly lots of goodwill for the Yorkshire-born politician. The affable Labour leader then moved on to Dalmellington Care Centre, where he planted a red rose to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. “My grandfather was a gardener, back in Leeds,” said Mr Leonard, as he wielded a spade. He heard about grassrooots co-operation in Dalmellinton among groups like The Zone and the care centre.  Mr Leonard said: “It’s the resilience of the people that’s keeping the Doon Valley going. “But it’s about time they were given a helping hand from government. “There are too many people living in poverty and on poverty pay. “We need investment in public services and we need to see communities having more control, with the possibility of community buy-outs.” Mr Leonard said only Labour is pledging a decade of investment. “We’re the only party opposing the austerity policies of the Tories, which are being passed on by the SNP.” He said the SNP’s own Growth Commission report revealed there would be even more austerity in an independent Scotland. And he was adamant: “The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to a second referendum on independence.”  Labour colleague Colin Smyth MSP said: “We’re seeing a growing frustration among voters on a debate focused on the constitution. “People want to see improvements in education and health.” Mr Leonard popped up to Bellsbank to see how streets are being transformed with ‘Balamory’ style painting of houses. In the afternoon, he visited the Sovereign Credit Union in Cumnock to hear about its services in the community. Then it was on to Tarbolton, to meet residents who are unhappy about their doctors’ surgery hours being cut, due to a shortage of GPs.

Four examples of these keeps survive in a ruinous state around Innerleithen and Traquair.\nThe walls themselves cannot speak so I have turned to Innerleithen \u0026amp Traquair, Past and Present, with an Angler\u0026rsquos Guide to the Tweed and its Tributaries (Second Edition \u0026ndash 1867), commonly called Smail\u0026rsquos Guide as it was published by Innerleithen printer Robert Smail.\nElibank Castle: \u0026ldquoAbout a mile east of Bold is Juniper Bank, near which \u0026ndash a considerable way up the hill \u0026ndash is the ruin of Elibank Tower, the ancient seat of the Murrays of Elibank, and famous for the story of Muckle-mouthed Meg, in which young Scott of Harden figured so conspicuously.

They resided in the old Tower on the hill, which is now in ruins. The Govans continued in possession of Cardrona until the latter end of the seventeenth century, when it was purchased by Mr Williamson, writer in Peebles, and Town Clerk of that burgh.

This was granted, and the work of demolition was soon begun. The roof was taken off and the chambers filled with earth, and in the course of a short time the effects of the weather made themselves apparent. The walls cracked in every direction, and large masses of the building fell.\nNext the crowbar was applied with great success and to make the appearance of an ancient ruin as near perfect as possible, a cartwheel was fixed in one of the largest rents, that the effect at a distance might be that of a venerable abbey. (Smails\u0026rsquo Guide, pp. 15 \u0026ndash 16)\nNether Horsburgh Castle: \u0026ldquo...we find that the lands of Easter Horseburgh, then called Schelynelaw, together with lands of Traquair and Innerleithen were, in 1634, in the hands of John Stewart of Traquair, who in that year was served heir to his brother Robert. The tradition in the family [Horseburgh] is that this part of the property was sold to defray the expenses of a lawsuit which had arisen between two brothers.\nAt Nether Horsburgh there are the remains of an old tower or keep, which used to be called Shillinglaw Tower.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

The proposal to turn the library, which as built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0027s Aldhammer House, were first put to the public in June 2016.  But they were criticised by Prestonpans Community Council, which said merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.

It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8195899.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.

East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.  Land was previously earmarked for a new doctors\u0026rsquo surgery to be created on the site of the new East Lothian Community Hospital, which is currently being built on the site of the former Roodlands Hospital.  The new hospital is expected to be complete in 2020 but no planning application has been submitted for a GP surgery at any site in the town, including the hospital and within the new Letham Mains development, which is sandwiched between the B6471 and the A6093.  Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership told the Courier that discussions had been taking place with Haddington GPs on how to support the growing population for \u0026ldquosome time.

Provost John McMillan, a councillor for Haddington and Lammermuir ward, said planning the development of any future health facility had to be carefully weighed up.  Mr McMillan also noted the variety of services which would be included within the new \u0026pound70 million hospital.

Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe wanted a second site because of the waiting list we had at Meadowpark and were delighted to be able to take on the former B\u0026ampB on West Road.  \u0026ldquoOur open day showed how much nursery places are in demand and with all the new houses being built we knew there was a need for it.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have a second nursery in Haddington.

According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated. There was public support for it in Dunbar and it will be good to see it going ahead and I am hopeful the outcome will be positive.  Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.

If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals (Trussell Trust stats).  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent (April 16 to March 17 was 37 per cent increase).  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8262375.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"tims-tales-the-mermaids-magic-storm","story":"  AFTER our return from a final camping trip in the midges and mist, my youngest daughter started school. She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform (although hair still looking slightly wild as she likes it), she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to (literally) beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8263378.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations. Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington. Mr Wallace said: \u0026ldquoIt made a huge difference \u0026ndash the kids loved seeing them and they were great."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8263446.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-headteacher-wants-to-make-knox-academy-a-flagship-school-for-east-lothian","story":"  Susan Cook took charge at the Haddington school this week after moving from Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Trinity Academy, where she was acting headteacher.  Pupils returned on Wednesday, with Ms Cook planning a series of assemblies to introduce herself to the students.  She said: \u0026ldquoI would like to make Knox Academy a flagship school in East Lothian \u0026ndash Scotland, potentially.  \u0026ldquoI want all young people to leave to a positive destination but be healthy and happy as they move through the school and really enjoy their school experience.  \u0026ldquoI want pupils to enjoy education in the widest sense, not just the curriculum but wider activities, and to develop as rounded individuals when they leave school to meet the demands of an ever-changing society.  Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoI found when I was at Trinity Academy, the headteacher and the senior leadership team were in the middle of the school. With an open foyer, you saw pupils pass.  \u0026ldquoI think it could be easy to shut the door and stay in the room. That is not what I want to do, I want to get out and about.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot really like sitting about, I want to engage with people.

Mrs Slowther, previously one of the school\u0026rsquos depute headteachers, was looking forward to the new term, with pupils starting back at school on Wednesday.  She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.  Currently the school is undergoing a large-scale expansion, which is due to be fully complete in early November.  Ahead of the new term starting, a section of the extension has been opened, which will give access to six new classrooms.  More than \u0026pound10 million is being spent on the extension, which includes a new two-storey L-shaped block to the east side of the school.  It will not only be home to new classrooms but also a home economics department, new library and learning centre with a dedicated IT space, and additional PE changing rooms.  Mrs Slowther, who has previously worked at both Knox Academy in Haddington and Ross High School, Tranent, felt it was a \u0026ldquophenomenally exciting time for the school.  The 36-year-old, who is joined by Ed Offer and Richard Maxton as depute headteachers, as well as Suzanne Hamilton as acting depute headteacher, said staff were taking the school into a new era.  The new headteacher, who was previously a biology teacher, added staff had talked about what they could do \u0026ldquoto preserve what is really special and how we continue delivering absolutely the best education for every young person that comes through our doors.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8263580.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"whats-on-this-weekend-five-ideas-of-things-to-do-in-east-lothian","story":"  1.

Therefore, it is absolutely right that we should look at ways in which to tackle this gendered inequality.  \"This latest announcement in our period poverty programme aims to help address the issue and make period poverty history in North Ayrshire.\"  A study published by girls\u0027 rights charity Plan International UK earlier this year found that 45% of those living in Scotland said they have been forced to use makeshift sanitary wear including socks or newspapers because they have struggled to buy products.  The Scottish Government is rolling out a project to provide free sanitary products to women from low-income households across Scotland following a pilot scheme in Aberdeen, while free sanitary products will also be available to those at school, college or university from this month.  Scottish Labour MSP Monica Lennon, who is bringing forward a Member\u0027s Bill to create a statutory duty for free provision of sanitary products, welcomed the scheme in North Ayrshire.  She said: \"Councillor Cullinane and North Ayrshire Council are leading the way on ending period poverty.  \"Access to sanitary products should be a right, regardless of your income, which is why I am moving ahead with plans for legislation to introduce a universal system of free access to sanitary products for everyone in Scotland.  \"I\u0027m delighted that North Ayrshire will extend free sanitary product provision to all of its public buildings and I hope other organisations will follow their lead.  \"No-one should face the indignity of being unable to access these essential products to manage their period.\""},{"url":null,"title":"the-last-dance-thousands-say-farewell-to-runrig","story":"  Runrig \u0026ndash that most Scottish of folk rock bands \u0026ndash performed their last-ever show against the backdrop of Stirling Castle last night. The event, which was titled The Last Dance, took place over Friday and Saturday, and original frontman Donnie Munro took to the stage for the occasion.  Around 52,000 fans flocked to Stirling over the two days, each with their own reasons to say farewell. The tickets had sold out only minutes after going on sale, with fans complaining that they had been snapped up by ticket resellers, for five times the original price.  Runrig, which are known for their Gaelic-language songs as much as the anthems that are sung as a climax to so many special occasions, were formed in 1973 on the Isle of Skye. Their roots have acted as an inspiration for some of their most popular songs, and it\u0026rsquos no surprise that they have a large fanbase hailing from their Hebridean heartland (that word, incidentally, being used as the name of one of their albums, in 1985).  Demand was so great that Scottish airline Loganair put on extra flights from the Western Isles to Edinburgh and Glasgow.  The band, which started by playing wedding receptions, are most widely known for their first single Loch Lomond. The instantly recognisable track spent five weeks in the charts in 1983, and it is still a go-to tune to end parties and weddings. But it is their wider body of work \u0026ndash 14 studio albums in total \u0026ndash that their fans were celebrating last night.  Katherine Street, who attended Friday\u0026rsquos show at Falleninch farm in Stirling, said: \u0026ldquoIt was absolutely fantastic. They played non-stop for over three hours. It was a superb venue with the backdrop of Stirling Castle. It was very well organised, very memorable, and I think the Runrig members were very moved by it.  The appearance of Munro was also a massive selling point. He left the band in 1997 to pursue a career in politics and went on to become a solo performer, but he was back, just like the old times and to the delight of the faithful.  \u0026ldquoDonnie also did a couple of numbers with the Glasgow Island Choir. It\u0026rsquos probably the best one I\u0026rsquove been to, and I\u0026rsquom not a huge Runrig fan, but that was a great night with a great crowd, said Street.  The six-strong band have undoubtedly made a large contribution to Scottish music and culture. The Canadian vocalist Bruce Guthro, who has toured with the band for 20 years, said: \u0026ldquoAll of it has been special. It\u0026rsquos almost impossible to pick certain highlights \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos just been a great journey.  This morning, many will be sad to see the band go their separate ways, but The Last Dance was a fitting send-off, and something that will be remembered for years to come.

Later, he will join Yanis Varoufakis, the economist and former Greek finance minister, at the Edinburgh International Book Festival for a discussion on building a \u0026ldquoprogressive international to counter the nationalist policies of Donald Trump and racist forces in Europe.  Mr Corbyn insists his \u0026ldquobuy British policy \u0026ldquois not turning away from the world, nor some return to protectionism or Trump-style trade wars, but an effort to give communities \u0026ldquoreal control over their local economy.  Mr Varoufakis agrees that globalisation has become unsustainable, but he rejects solutions that stop people and commodities from moving about the planet.  Speaking ahead of his visit to Falkirk, Mr Corbyn said: \u0026ldquoThe next Labour government will reprogramme the economy to deliver an industrial renaissance for Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Tories have overseen the decline of our industries and farmed out major public contracts overseas that could have supported jobs at home. Meanwhile, the SNP government has not done nearly enough to grow Scotland\u0026rsquos industrial base or the green economy.  \u0026ldquoA lack of support for manufacturing is sucking the dynamism out of our economy, pay from the pockets of workers and any hope of secure well-paid jobs from a generation of our young people.  \u0026ldquoLabour will use the public sector\u0026rsquos enormous buying power to support workers and industries by buying in Britain whenever possible. We will boost Scottish manufacturing, which will support jobs and living standards in the wider economy, strengthen our capacity to export, and expand our tax base. It\u0026rsquos time the Scottish people had a government with the determination to create an economy that works for the many, not the few.  But the SNP said Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos the Labour leader\u0026rsquos support for a \u0026ldquojobs-destroying Tory hard Brexit was a threat to Scotland\u0026rsquos economy and a \u0026ldquototal betrayal of working people.  Ian Blackford, the party\u0026rsquos Westminster leader, said Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquofantasy claims on the economy were \u0026ldquosimply not credible given the \u0026ldquocatastrophic impact a hard Brexit would have on jobs, businesses, living standards, and economic growth.  He called on Mr Corbyn to join the SNP in fighting to protect membership of the EU single market and customs union.  Mr Blackford said: \u0026ldquoJeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos support for a jobs-destroying Tory hard Brexit is by far the biggest threat to Scotland\u0026rsquos economy and long term prosperity and would deal a devastating blow to the incomes and living standards of millions of Scottish families.  \u0026ldquoIt is a total betrayal of working people, who have already been hit in the pocket by Brexit as prices rise, and it would be catastrophic for Scottish businesses and economic growth, leaving the whole country poorer and worse off.He added: \u0026ldquoJeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos fantasy claims on the economy are simply not credible while Labour continue to back the Tories\u0026rsquo reckless hard Brexit plans.  \u0026ldquoWe know from UK Government, Scottish Government, and wider analysis that a hard Brexit could hit Scottish GDP by up to 9 per cent, costing Scotland over \u0026pound12.7 billion a year, a loss equivalent to over \u0026pound2,300 for every person in the country, with around 80,000 jobs at stake.  \u0026ldquoInstead of backing the Tories again, Labour must finally join the SNP in fighting to protect our crucial membership of the EU single market and customs union.

The new \u0026ldquointelligent urinals are housed in flower boxes, painted bright red, have nearby signs advertising their presence, and have a straw layer that eliminates odour that can be removed and used for fertiliser.  Edinburgh and Glasgow have considered installing pissoirs on a number of occasions, in response to a flood of complaints about public urination, but they failed to make a splash with councillors who fear a similar public backlash.  However, drunk revellers \u0026ndash as well as those with medical conditions or just an inconveniently full bladder \u0026ndash are getting increasingly caught short.  A BBC investigation found a widespread decline in public toilets throughout the UK.    (These public toilets in Glasgow city centre are among those that have been closed in recent years.\u0026nbspPicture:\u0026nbspMichael Boyd)  Glasgow, Scotland\u0026rsquos biggest city, which once exported cast iron \u0026ldquoTemples of Convenience throughout the UK from its Victorian foundries, now maintains just eight public toilets.  Public toilets in Edinburgh have almost halved from 29 in 2010 to 17, despite frequent complaints about public urination in popular nightspots such as the Grassmarket and Cowgate.  Edinburgh announced plans to trial open air urinals in the Grassmarket in 2010, at a cost of \u0026pound9,000 apiece, but the public pissoirs did not emerge. It floated a similar idea for The Meadows in 2013 but the public park remained a urinal free zone.  An Edinburgh Council spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWhile the idea of open air toilets has been considered in the past, there are currently no plans to introduce these in Edinburgh.  Aberdeen City Council is one of the only Scottish councils to successfully introduce public pissoirs in 2011, but they were withdrawn last year after the cost of maintaining them soared.  In a letter, a council community safety officer said: \u0026ldquoThe decision originally came due to environmental services no longer being able to collect and return the pissoirs as their vehicle required replacing.  \u0026ldquoThe cost implications of purchasing a new vehicle just to allow this service to continue was huge compared to the standard specification of vehicle they required.  \u0026ldquoThis, along with their recalculation of internal charges, wages, hours, meant there would be an increased internal cost from \u0026pound9,000 per annum to more than \u0026pound35,000 per annum.  An Aberdeen City Council spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe urinals were introduced around 2008 and attracted no strong comment, either approving or disapproving they were well used however. There were no comments with regard to equality and indeed figures had shown that urinating in public was an issue almost exclusively among men. The initiative ended when the particular mode of transport used to move the urinals was no longer available.  Raymond Martin, managing director of the British Toilet Association, said it was time to put toilet provision on par with other public services that cater for people\u0026rsquos basic needs.\u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos five things we need to do as human beings \u0026mdash eat, drink, sleep, breath and do the toilet, he said. \u0026ldquoGoing to the toilet is as important as eating, sleeping, breathing and drinking, he said. \u0026ldquoIf you don\u0026rsquot get rid of the poisons from your body you die.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove been saying to the Government, we don\u0026rsquot need high-speed trains, we don\u0026rsquot need extra aircraft carriers, but we have people with medical conditions, pregnant mums, families with young children, people who pay their taxes, who have nowhere to go if they need to perform a vital human function when they\u0026rsquore out on the street.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove spoken to politicians about it and they say, \u0026lsquoWell, there\u0026rsquos plenty of bars they can go to\u0026rsquo. Bars? That\u0026rsquos their answer. Anyone under 18 can\u0026rsquot go in a bar. Single mums can\u0026rsquot go into a bar.\u0026ldquoPregnant women or lone females might not be comfortable going into a bar. People from a religious or ethnic background who don\u0026rsquot drink alcohol can go into bars. That\u0026rsquos about two-thirds of the population.  \u0026ldquoToilets are about health and wellbeing, public dignity, public decency, equality and social inclusion.  He has urged local authorities to install Urilifts, retractable public urinals that emerge from the ground at night and are installed in some cities in England.  \u0026ldquoYou wouldn\u0026rsquot even know it\u0026rsquos there during the day because it retracts into the pavement, but at 10pm you press a button and it rises out of the payment on an electronic pile, he said.\u0026ldquoIt has three concave sides so a gentleman can stand up against it and urinate.  \u0026ldquoSome are at major road junctions but it\u0026rsquos nearly impossible to see what\u0026rsquos going on, beyond a man standing at a structure.  \u0026ldquoThere are probably about 40 of these devices in Britain, including London, Winchester and Belfast in Shaftesbury Square and it works very well.  \u0026ldquoPeople\u0026rsquos initial reaction is, \u0026lsquoWhat? \u0026lsquoWe don\u0026rsquot want people peeing the streets!\u0026rsquo \u0026ldquoBut people are already peeing \u0026mdash and defecting \u0026mdash in shop doorways and they\u0026rsquore causing a bigger problem because squads have to go out and clean it up.\u0026ldquoSome shopkeepers refuse to clean it because they pay their taxes to councils who are responsible for cleaning it.  The Pop Up Toilet Company also supplies facilities with doors as a safe option for women to use late at night.\u0026ldquoYou can\u0026rsquot really open public toilets late at night because of the danger from drug users, drunk people, or the risk of attack, said Mr Martin.  \u0026ldquoWe recognise that you need something for girls, some of whom are running up dark alleyways in the middle of the night to pee which is frightening.  \u0026ldquoI wouldn\u0026rsquot want my daughter running up a dark alleyway where they could be molested or injured because they can\u0026rsquot see properly.  \u0026ldquoThe Urilift costs \u0026pound25,000 to buy but it\u0026rsquos self cleaning as when the unit goes back into the ground it cleans the walls.  Mr Martin said the provision of public toilets should be a central government priority if the postcode lottery of provision throughout the UK is to be ended.  \u0026ldquoThe Government doesn\u0026rsquot give councils any money to provide public toilets and it never has, he said.  \u0026ldquoThere is no legislation that says councils have to provide public toilets.  The council has not written any legislation other than legislation affecting cafes and restaurants.  \u0026ldquoCouncils have provided toilets for years because they don\u0026rsquot want residents to use parks, gardens, beaches and public spaces in towns and cities and they don\u0026rsquot want people urinating in the streets and exposing themselves in public.  \u0026ldquoCouncils were happy to pay for it until 2011, when the Government cut council budgets by 20 per cent and most of them closed public toilets at a stroke.  \u0026ldquoThe council has mandatory duties such as cleaning the streets, fixing the roads and education \u0026mdash and toilets come under discretionary services alongside things like park benches, litter bins and flowerbeds.  \u0026ldquoThe Audit Commission used to keep figures on the number of fines issued for public urination, but they stopped it some time ago. The Government had \u0026ldquo washed its hands of public toilets, he added."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/2616913.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scots-football-manager-david-moyes-made-man-utd-worry-more-about-their-opponents","story":"  That\u0027s the take of former United captain Rio Ferdinand, who has spoken about the Scot\u0027s ill-fated stint at Old Trafford after taking over from Sir Alex Ferguson.

As football\u0026rsquos bosses make their minds up, Susan Aitken, the leader of Glasgow City Council, has written to the SFA president with a series of suggestions for improvement and reasons why Hampden should be the winner.  She said that if the stadium owners were to make a valid application for safe standing areas, there would be \u0026ldquono obvious barriers to it being given the go-ahead by the council.  Fans complain the view from behind the goals in the east and west stands is poor and the stadium lacks atmosphere.  If the suggestion was taken up, it could see thousands of fans standing for Scotland internationals and for domestic cup finals and the semi-finals.  Ms Aitken has sought to address concerns of fans whose match-day experience has not been positive with the behind the goal areas a common complaint.  In a survey of supporters, it was found that 40 per cent said the experience was bad or very bad.  She said: \u0026ldquoA regular discussion point about Hampden is the capacity to enhance the fan experience, particularly the sight lines at the east and west ends of the stadium.  Ms Aitken said that she did not believe that significant structural change was the only way to resolve the criticisms.  She added: \u0026ldquoOne of the most significant developments in fan experience in recent years has been pioneered in Glasgow, with Celtic Park successfully operating a safe standing area for the past two seasons.  \u0026ldquoInterest in whether a similar scheme would appeal to other clubs and fans has not been limited to our other clubs in the city.  \u0026ldquoIndeed there has been correspondence from local authorities and senior clubs from across the UK, seeking more information about how we have facilitated safe standing in the city.  Ms Aitken gave encouragement to a bid for safe standing and the council has already given permission for Celtic\u0026rsquos safe standing area, occupied by the Green Brigade fans group.  She said \u0026ldquoWere an application for a standing area at Hampden submitted to Glasgow City Council, providing it met all the relevant safety, stewarding and accessibility criteria, there would be no obvious barriers to the bid being approved by the authority.  Celtic Park is currently the only stadium in Scotland with a safe standing area, with 2,600 rail seats which allow standing and then seats when required for European matches.  There are no safe standing areas in England, where it is prohibited following the Taylor report into the Hillsborough disaster.  If applied for and approved, it could mean a return to thousands of fans standing behind the goals at one or both ends of Hampden.  The SFA board will meet next week to discuss a bid by Hampden Park to retain its national stadium status and by the Scottish Rugby Union for a deal to host matches at Murrayfield.  Ms Aitken also said that Fan Zones could be introduced to improve the match-day experience.  She added: \u0026ldquoFan Zones are a growing part of the footballing landscape and will be a key aspect of the fan experience for Euro 2020.  \u0026ldquoThis move towards providing a family-focused platform for improving the match-day experience is broadly welcomed by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"children-with-learning-difficulties-losing-out-in-tests","story":"  Feedback on the roll-out of the literacy and numeracy assessments also called for improvements for pupils with visual impairments.  The concerns emerged shortly after the launch of a national campaign to derail the tests in P1, backed by national charities, teaching unions and parents groups.  The tests in P1 are part of a raft of new assessments, with further testing in P4, P7 and S3. The Scottish Government argues testing in the first year of primary gives an idea of what level pupils are at when they come to school. But critics claim they are too stressful for the youngest pupils.  Fresh concerns over their suitability for pupils with additional support needs emerged from a freedom of information request to CALL Scotland, an organisation based at Edinburgh University which helps pupils overcome barriers to education.  An email from Professor John Ravenscroft, who specialises in childhood visual impairment, said there were problems with presentation, the length of text in some questions and compatibility with pupils used to traditional Braille.  Mr Ravenscroft said that in one extreme case a child spent the equivalent of two days completing the tests.  Also included in the release is a list of concerns from CALL Scotland staff who carried out testing on the new system in May this year, eight months after they were introduced in schools across Scotland.  Noted problems included distracting features, unclear instructions and technological features not working properly.  A further document, sent to Call Scotland by a local government worker, said initial difficulty levels were \u0026ldquotoo challenging for children with numeracy difficulties.  A Scottish Government spokesman said the assessments had been designed to be as accessible as possible and were compatible with a large variety of devices.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is important because it means learners are able to complete the assessments using the tools familiar to them from everyday classroom practice - such as the screen readers used by visually impaired pupils.  Additional measures include having accessibility text embedded within questions for the visually impaired.

Glasgow, Dunbartonshire and Edinburgh continue to be hot spots, with properties typically selling for \u0026pound22,000 and \u0026pound23,000 above their asking price.  Commenting on Glasgow\u0026rsquos performance, Barry Chuwen, director of MQ Estate Agents, said: \u0026ldquoThe second quarter of 2018 continues to be very positive with sales regularly exceeding home report values throughout the various districts, with a constant need for properties as the enquiry levels exceed availability of stock often resulting in closing dates. 2018 expectations are for another very productive year with excellent sales prices and swift turnaround times.  Pauline Smith, senior property manager from Watt Properties, said that the Edinburgh market showed no sign of slowing down. She said: \u0026ldquoEdinburgh\u0026rsquos property market continues to strengthen with a 1.78% increase in the average asking price and the amount of properties available increasing. This is reflected in the average selling price having stayed fairly constant in 2018. A busy summer is indicating that demand for properties in Edinburgh remains buoyant.  Other parts of the country fared less well. In Argyll \u0026amp Bute, East Renfrewshire, West Lothian and South Lanarkshire, East Lothian and Falkirk, buyers can pay less than the average asking price.  Eric Curran, managing partner of chartered surveyor firm DM Hall and former chairman of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS Residential Property Professional Group board, advised sellers to be realistic about the price they wished to market their homes for, adding: \u0026ldquoSurveyors are looking to manage the expectations of sellers. The problem with the property market is that there are so many micro markets. It all depends on the different types of regional markets.  \u0026ldquoThe bottom line if you are looking to sell a property is to maintain your property, present it as well as you can, and to make sure it\u0026rsquos marketed properly at a sensible price. If you market a property at a price people are going to like, If you market a property at a price that\u0026rsquos too high, it will sit for a long time on the market and people start to wonder what\u0026rsquos wrong with it. If you market it at a sensible price and you get people to look at it, you build up demand. Somebody will want to purchase it, rather than just see it.  \u0026ldquoSellers have the opportunity to sell their homes at a premium price. There\u0026rsquos no certainty \u0026ndash you really don\u0026rsquot know until you test the market.  Mr Curran said there was less demand for detached properties because of affordability. The Scottish House Price report compares the asking prices of over 20,000 properties for sale on s1homes with the actual prices achieved."},{"url":null,"title":"more-than-a-third-of-farmed-fruit-and-veg-wasted-researchers-say","story":"  A university study estimated that over 50 million tonnes of fresh produce grown across Europe is discarded annually, mainly because it does not meet supermarkets\u0026rsquo and consumers\u0026rsquo standards of how it ought to look.  In the UK, the figure stands at up to 4.5 million tonnes, the team suggests.  The research paper described food loss and waste (FLW) as \u0026ldquoone of the great scourges of our time, when 10% of the world\u0026rsquos population is chronically hungry.  The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Edinburgh, who examined how much food is discarded within the European Economic Area (EEA) each year before it reaches the point of sale.  Their findings stated: \u0026ldquoThe use of aesthetics for classifying and accepting fresh food for sale and consumption is built into food quality standards and regulations of the European Union.  \u0026ldquoThe food distribution sector in Europe and the UK is oligopolistic in nature a small number of supermarket chains control a large market share. The influence of these \u0026lsquomultiples\u0026rsquo enables them to impose additional proprietary \u0026lsquoquality\u0026rsquo criteria.  \u0026ldquoProduce that doesn\u0026rsquot meet these standards may be lost from the food supply chain, never seeing a supermarket shelf \u0026ndash it may not get past the supplier, or even leave the farm.  The team said they found few direct measurements of such losses, but continued: \u0026ldquoWe estimate avoidable FLW from on-farm cosmetic grade-outs of up to 4,500 kt yr (4.5 million tonnes per year) in the UK and 51,500 kt yr (51.5 million tonnes per year) in the European Economic Area (EEA).  \u0026ldquoOur estimates suggest over a third of total farm production is lost for aesthetic reasons.  The university said the climate change impact of growing the wasted food \u0026ndash some of which may be ploughed back into fields, used in animal feed or otherwise reused \u0026ndash is equivalent to the carbon emissions of almost 400,000 cars.  The scientists suggest that greater awareness among consumers, and a movement towards shopping sustainably, could encourage the sale of more \u0026ldquougly vegetables.  They also suggest a greater use of misshapen produce, perhaps in chopped or processed goods, or for sale at a discount to charities.  Professor David Reay, of the university\u0026rsquos school of geosciences, said: \u0026ldquoThe scale of food that is wasted when it is perfectly safe to eat is shocking at a time when one tenth of the world\u0026rsquos population is perpetually underfed.  Stephen Porter, also from the school, added: \u0026ldquoEncouraging people to be less picky about how their fruit and vegetables look could go a long way to cutting waste, reducing the impact of food production on the climate, and easing the food supply chain.  The study has been published in the Journal of Cleaner Production."},{"url":null,"title":"woman-runs-1500-miles-from-shetland-to-penzance-in-hospice-fundraiser","story":"  Faith Addison will run 1,500 miles from Shetland to Penzance in Cornwall \u0026ndash the equivalent of over 57 marathons \u0026ndash in 42 days.

The 34-year-old, who used to live in Stroud, Gloucestershire, but now lives in Shetland, is raising money for Longfield Hospice Care because the charity is supporting her godfather Larry Leighton, who has Parkinson\u0026rsquos disease.  \u0026ldquoThis isn\u0026rsquot an easy challenge. It\u0026rsquos going to be tough. But if I raise valuable funds for my godfather\u0026rsquos chosen charity Longfield it will be worth it.  \u0026ldquoIn my godfather\u0026rsquos words, \u0026lsquothey are wonderful\u0026rsquo, said Miss Addison, who works as a locum pharmacist throughout the UK.  Besides supporting the Longfield charity, she will also raise funds for Parkinson\u0026rsquos UK.  This is not the first time she has set herself a feat.  She has twice cycled from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats and climbed the three highest peaks of Scotland, England and Wales.  When she turned 30, she used the money she had saved for a house deposit on her dream holiday \u0026ndash cycling around the world.  Miss Addison spent 30 months \u0026ndash 11 of them in New Zealand, a country she fell in love with \u0026ndash on her epic journey.  Despite being hit by a car, being hospitalised and having to cycle the last 7,000km home in midwinter conditions, she said it was easy and she loved every minute of it.  The hardest part, she said, was buying the one-way ticket to New Zealand.  \u0026ldquoWhen I turned 30 I was looking to buy a house but a friend asked me if there was anything I had always wanted to do before settling, and I said cycle across the world. So I did it, she said.  Her taste for adventure and travel started early.  \u0026ldquoWhen I was 11 or 12 my parents allowed my older brother, a cousin and myself to cycle from Stroud to the Black Mountains on our own in just one day, she said.  \u0026ldquoIt was a 50-mile bike ride. I just loved the adventures. My parents allowed us to have so much freedom as children and holidays were always spontaneous, and that love of adventure and freedom has stayed with me.

Most of the families were driven apart during the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty, leaving the Korean Peninsula still in a technical state of war.  Buses carrying the elderly South Koreans attending this week\u0026rsquos reunions arrived at a border immigration office on Monday morning.  After undergoing immigration checks, they were to cross the border by bus and travel to the Diamond Mountain resort.  Past reunions have produced powerful images of elderly Koreans crying, embracing and caressing each other. Nearly 20,000 people have participated in 20 rounds of face-to-face reunions held between the countries since 2000.  Another 3,700 exchanged video messages with their North Korean relatives under a short-lived programme from 2005 to 2007. No one has had a second chance to see their relatives.  According to Seoul\u0026rsquos Unification Ministry, 197 separated South Koreans and their family members will take part in the first round of reunions that run from Monday to Wednesday. Another 337 South Koreans will participate in a second round of reunions from Friday to Sunday.  South Korea will also send dozens of medical and emergency staff to Diamond Mountain to prepare for potential health problems considering the large number of elderly participants.  Many of the South Korean participants are war refugees born in North Korea who will be meeting their siblings or the infant children they left behind, many of them now into their 70s.  During the three years since the reunions were last held, the North tested three nuclear weapons and multiple missiles that demonstrated a potential of striking the continental United States.  North Korea has shifted to diplomacy in recent months. Leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a son of North Korean war refugees, agreed to resume the reunions during the first of their two summits this year in April.  South Korea sees the separated families as the largest humanitarian issue created by the war, which killed and injured millions and cemented the division of the Korean Peninsula into the North and South. The ministry estimates there are currently about 600,000 to 700,000 South Koreans with immediate or extended relatives in North Korea.  But Seoul has failed to persuade Pyongyang to accept its long-standing call for more frequent reunions with more participants."},{"url":null,"title":"imran-khan-pledges-to-restore-pakistans-economy","story":"  In his first televised speech Khan, who a day earlier was sworn in as 22nd prime minister, promised reforms across all fields.  \u0026ldquoI want to see Pakistan a great country with social services for the poor, Khan said.

The company, renowned for brewing oddly-named beers, are based just outside the town in a purpose-built brewery which also serves at its headquarters.

The company’s response was to suspend him from his post in order to explore options, but then later sacked him, despite them having been advised by medical experts on the condition, that with some suitable adjustments to his working conditions, he could continue to be a valuable employee.        The employment tribunal which heard the case has now issued its ruling that BrewDog unlawfully discriminated against Mr Ross and treated him unfavourably because of his condition.The company, which has been valued at £1.8bn were told to pay compensation to Mr Ross in the sum of £12,052.New legislation which passed into law in 2015 prevented the tribunal from ordering that BrewDog staff undergo further equality training.A spokesman for the company said: “This was a really difficult situation for every member of our team involved in it, and clearly for the Tribunal panel too as their decision on the outcome was split.                                                                                                         “We worked with James in order to find a suitable alternative role within the business where his safety would not be compromised, but James wanted to keep his packaging role. “We ended up in a position where we had to balance James’ wishes with the best interests of the team around him, and while we regret that an agreement couldn’t be reached, we have a moral responsibility to prioritise the safety of our team. “We wish James all the best in his new role and his upcoming studies.”RNIB Scotland, which supports blind and partially sighted people, said: “Many employers still assume this group would be difficult or even impossible to employ.                                                                                                        “We know of journalists, teachers, bankers and physicists working in Scotland with sight loss.“It’s about encouraging employers to consider what people can do, not what they can’t.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"nicola is inspiring example of industry","story":"                And here in the north-east, the list includes the former police office in Kemnay.

In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Monday 20 Aug 2018 8:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Monday 20 Aug 2018 8:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

This will also improve the availability of recycled material for use in the production of bottles and cans in future.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to provide their views on how this scheme can meet Scotland’s needs and help us tackle our throwaway culture.”Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Scotland’s planned deposit return scheme is a landmark in the nation’s circular economy journey, with the potential to drive inward investment and create jobs in Scotland at the same time as improving recycling and reducing litter.\u0026#8221Consultation available to view.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The 3.6km section between Glendoe and Loch Tarff has been particularly challenging and would not have been possible without funding support from SSE, Highland Council and the Scottish Government and European Union totalling \u0026pound250,000, as well as the full support from Glendoe Estate over whose land the trail has been constructed. The opening of this section opens up the South Loch Ness Trail to more walkers, mountain bikers and horse riders and, particularly on this section of the trail, to those of limited mobility.\"Mr Ambrose added that the creation of the LochNess360\u0026deg trail will bring new opportunities for businesses, communities and deliver major economic benefit to the area in the long term.\"It will achieve this because it will attract visitors who may spend up to six to seven days completing the full circuit,\" he added. We know from feedback that there is already substantial interest from key European markets, particularly Germany, and VILN hope by spring 2019 to confidently go out to markets and promote it. As part of the promotion we plan to launch a major new three day running/walking/cycling event in 2020.\"Monday 20 Aug 2018 8:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Her cooking was what initially drew clients to come to the centre and her baking, he said, was \"legendary\".This theme was echoed by speeches from Ina Mackenzie, Mina Stewart and Kerry Watson. Laela Maclean composed a poem which reminisced and poked good-natured fun at Cis\u0026rsquos life in Lochcarron and the Centre.Cis\u0026rsquos husband Sandy kept the feet tapping with musical interludes on his accordion \u0026mdash including one tune called Christine Ross of Lochcarron, initially written for Cis by the late Iain Crichton, from Stornoway.Christine Houser, Donar MacIver and his son, Stephen MacIver sang Gaelic songs \u0026mdash the eyes of some of the older guests lighting up as they joined in the choruses.Cis was aided by Morag MacCuish to cut her retirement cake which had been made by Harry Gow, her favourite baker. She made a speech thanking everyone for their presence and for the gifts she had received from the clients, staff and board members.The event provided a lovely send-off for Cis. The afternoon ended with everyone joining hands to sing Auld Lang Syne accompanied musically, as in life, by her husband Sandy.Monday 20 Aug 2018 8:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this. The guys just said they were acting on instructions.\"Hamish Mackenzie of Tarbat Community Council wrote to Highland Council chief executive Steve Barron back in June after receiving apologies in January from local authority community services staff for the lack of warning.They said the equipment was removed on health and safety grounds \u0026ndash a reason given in other similar instances across the region.However Mr Mackenzie says follow-up enquiries for details about land ownership and the legalities of the situation have not been responded to months later.\"The first choice is to get Highland Council to continue to maintain the park in accordance with the original agreement. People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid. Let\u0026rsquos hope the community gets a quick turnaround and are able to buy the equipment needed and get it ready for next summer.\"Highland Council was approached for comment but had not responded as we went to press.Monday 20 Aug 2018 8:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Hopes for a visitor trail around an area that was heavily militarised during WWII are now full steam ahead after the project team behind the Aultbea museum secured almost \u0026pound73,000 from the Scottish Land Fund towards the purchase of a former butcher\u0026rsquos shop it has been renting to house the display.People from 19 countries outside the UK were amongst the 5500-plus visitors dropping in between May and October last year and that number is set to mushroom as the facility is improved and plans for a wider trail developed.The project\u0026rsquos chairman Francis Russell told the Journal: \"To some extent we have become masters of our own destiny. This opens up new avenues of funding. The location on the NC500 is very important.\"We ask people when they come in how they heard about us and some say it was while they were driving by. It puts us on the map. We\u0026rsquoll look at the feasibility and cost of a major refurbishment and possibly an extension. We could do with much more space.\"Fellow project volunteer Elizabeth Miles said the boost \"will allow us to get on to develop it the way we would like\".She said: \"Owning the site will open new possibilities. We will look to create a WWII trail where everywhere gets visited. We\u0026rsquore hoping to really do something with it.\"Research found the NC500, which passes the makeshift museum, brought 29,000 extra visitors in its first year, adding an extra \u0026pound9m to the Highland economy.The \u0026pound72,820 award will contribute towards the purchase of the former butcher\u0026rsquos shop and surrounding land.Honorary president of the RACP George Milne said the aim is to create a multi-site museum for current and future generations to learn about the convoys.He said: \"The overall aim is to establish a unique multi-site museum in Wester Ross. Around Loch Ewe we hope to create a permanent exhibition centre, a WWII Trail with interpretation panels, a memorial garden, and the preservation of selected wartime buildings to honour all who served in the Arctic convoys to and from Russia from 1941-1945.\"\u0026nbspThe 75th anniversary of the last convoy to sail from the area will be marked in 2020, with relatives of servicemen and visitors from around the world expected to come in their droves.Gairloch Heritage Museum, which itself secured backing from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise for a \u0026pound2m project to convert the old anti-aircraft operations room in the centre of the village into a state of the art new facility, welcomed the news.It said: \"Congratulations to our friends at Russian Arctic Convoy Museum on procuring the funds to purchase their exhibition centre.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife. Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Monday 20 Aug 2018 8:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

She said: \"All the neighbours were out watching. The road was like a volcano.\"She said: \"If they patch this now, it\u0026rsquoll only burst another six weeks down the line further down.

One burst in May at 5am cut off half of Tain.\"Councillor Alasdair Rhind voiced frustration over the pace of the clean-up and wants Scottish Water to replace a substantive length of pipe to combat a repeat. He said: \"The most cost effective way would be to renew the pipe rather than having to call in squads of repairmen each time.\"A spokesman for Scottish Water apologised to customers affected and said the performance of mains is closely monitored \"to target investment where it is most needed, recognising that replacing water mains typically involves higher cost and further disruption for residents, whereas targeted repairs can often restore reliable service\".He said: \"Given the deteriorating performance of a section of the main serving customers in Knockbreck Avenue over recent months, this has now been identified as a priority and we will therefore be replacing the length of water main where bursts have occurred. We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Monday 20 Aug 2018 8:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"various apprenticeships ","story":" Radar Technician – SERCO – Unst\nApprenticeship vacancies are open to male and female applicants, candidates over age 25 will be considered for some vacancies.\nWages vary dependent on employer.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies.

A car park, for example, would be a major benefit, although that would of course be a question for the current community council to consider.\"\nAlso there to view the proposals was local Highland councillor Muriel Cockburn, who heard that the new works would have capacity to produce up to 200,000 litres of drinking water per day, supplied by an \"abundant source of raw water from the River Spey\".\n\"It all looks like a major improvement,\" she said, as she surveyed the old treatment works \u0026ndash mere yards from the disused compound where A9 mega pylon workers had been based until a few years ago.\nConcerns have long been raised over that particular eyesore but hopes are high now that a new tenant will be moving in soon to make use of the building.\nFull details of that particular development are still awaited.\nBut if the Scottish Water team win through on schedule, their new treatment works would be installed between the two old buildings.\n\"Obviously we will have to go on using the old treatment works while we construct the new system,\" explained project manager Debbie Henderson. \"But once in place the village will have a new works to look at.\n\"It will actually include two new buildings, which will be prefabricated and delivered to the site from Ross-shire Engineering\u0027s factory in Muir of Ord.\"\nGeorge Phimister, the company\u0027s senior project manager, explained: \"The main treatment process involved passing the raw water through a series of membranes which filter out larger organic compounds while allowing clean water molecules to pass through very fine pores.\n\"The water that has passed through the membranes is then treated further to ensure that it meets customers\u0027 expectations and remains safe to drink all the way to the tap.\"\nThe system will involve new piping from bore holes to a storage tank to the north of the village.\nMr Steel explained: \"Having gathered local feedback we will consider the comments will later advise customers when we are submitting our planning application.\n\"Subject to being granted approval, we anticipate being on site in early 2019, with work continuing into 2020.\"\nMonday 20 Aug 2018 8:39 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117090.jpg","title":"Leader echoes call for special case funding","story":"Iain Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nTHE Scottish Government is \"short-changing\" the Highlands, according to Scottish Liberal Democrats\u0027 leader Willie Rennie.\nHe has echoed local politicians and organisations who argue that Highland is a \"special case\" because of its vast geography.\nHe has told us that he agrees with council chiefs that the region merits a larger share of grant distributed by Holyrood.\n\"The special nature of services in this part of the country isn\u0027t recognised by the Scottish Government,\" Mr Rennie said. \"Highland is short-changed on the NHS and the way the Scottish Government tried to short-change it through council tax changes in 2016 was outrageous.\"\nA proposal was mooted, but later scrapped, for inflicting higher council tax band payers with an extra levy \u0026ndash \u0026pound5 million in Highland \u0026ndash to fund education attainment.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27430  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\n“Ahed was persecuted for defending her family and community from brutal, aggressive Israeli oppressors.

Heart Foundation Northern Ireland (BHF NI).\n  \nMairead Agnew was inspired by her young neighbour Mark Lynn, who has complex congenital heart disease. At just 8 years old, he has undergone four open heart surgeries and numerous cardiac procedures. \n  \nIn 2015 Mark was diagnosed with heart failure but this still hasn’t stopped him and his parents Donna and Geoff supporting BHF NI and raising almost \u0026pound3,000 for the charity.\n  \nMairead explained: “My sister was born with congenital heart disease so this is a cause that has always been extremely close to mine and my family’s hearts. When I saw the wonderful fundraising that Mark and his family had raised, I wanted to do something to help. When I told Mark I was taking on the Berlin Marathon, he was sure he wanted us to support BHF NI once again.”\n  \nKaren McCammon, Health Services Engagement Lead for BHF NI explained: “When the BHF was founded in 1961, 8 out of every 10 babies born with congenital heart disease died before their first birthday. Our research has helped to turn this around, and now 8 out of 10 babies survive to adulthood. Breakthroughs such as these are only possible because of the support we receive from supporters like Mairead, Mark and his family. We are therefore extremely grateful for all their efforts.”\n  \nBHF have also developed pioneering surgical techniques to treat complex congenital defects. However, there is still much more work to be done. For children like Mark, who have complex congenital heart disease, treatment can be much more difficult.\n  \nMairead, Mark and his family are keen to raise as much awareness and funds as possible and are asking everyone to support in any way they can. You can donate to Mairead or Mark in person or call into any of the following businesses in Ballymena: The Moat Bar, Kockeden Lodge, Credit Union, Willy Allen’s Butchers, The Mace, Ballykeel Chemist, Molly Malone’s Chip Shop and A Star Valeting and Detailing, Ballymena who are running a special offer between August 16 and September 16 - offering full valets for just \u0026pound60 and \u0026pound70 for jeeps and 4x4\u0027s, \u0026pound2 of every full valet will be donated to the cause.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921264.jpg--.jpg?1534230306000\n","title":"plans to extend public realm scheme to greenvale street","story":"  \nPLANS are being considered to extend the Public Realm Scheme to Greenvale Street in Ballymena Town Centre.\n  \nHowever, one local business owner who has been based on the street for 20 years, has hit out at the lack of consultation around the proposals.\n  \nClaire Brennan of Oasis Hair Salon claims she has had to rely on “hearsay” in a bid to find out more about the plans.\n  \nNIE is currently carrying out utility works on the street which is expected to last four weeks.\n  \nClaire said: “I have heard that after the four weeks they are planning to rip the entire street up and replace it as part of the Public Realm Scheme. I understand that the work is expected to last right up until Christmas.\n  \n“My issue is firstly there has been no consultation, I don\u0027t know exactly what they are planning to do. \n  \n“We are relying on hearsay at the minute and I have heard that there are plans to lay stone similar to the rest of the town.” \n  \nClaire said she had written a letter to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council about the issue.\n  \nShe continued: “It took ten days to get a reply which said there was “nothing concrete at the minute”.\n  \nClaire said that among her concerns was that the area has a very slopping street which raises issues around what type of paving is used.\n  \nShe added: “Also there are concerns around water flowing down the street due to the slope and the fact that if the paving used is light in colour chewing gum, which will eventually cover it, will turn black and soon make the street look grubby and shabby.”\n  \nClaire said she would like to see either the street remain the same and be “brought back to its former glory” or be consulted on any proposed plans.\n  \n“We want to have a debate about it, not have to rely on hearsay.

Alan rounds off with some insights into the general history of dam-building in this country and relates how civil engineering has developed its own code of ethics over the 200 years since the foundation of the Institution of Civil Engineers.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921285.jpg--.jpg?1534232428000\n","title":"estelle in the frame for spectacle wearer of year win","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman has been chosen from thousands of proud glasses wearers as a finalist for Specsavers’ Spectacle Wearer of the Year.\n  \nEstelle Wallace, shortlisted in the 45 – 59 age category from Rasharkin could follow in the footsteps of last year’s Award winner, Love Island hunk Alex Miller, winning \u0026pound10,000 and the chance to mingle with the stars at the annual awards. \n  \nGlasses wearers across the UK and Republic of Ireland have been showing off their specs style by sharing their selfies online.\n  \nEstelle, who is a health and wellness coach, was invited to visit her local Specsavers store in Fairhill Shopping Centre to receive a bottle of champagne, a certificate and a \u0026pound125 glasses voucher.\n  \nEstelle said: “I was really delighted to be shortlisted as a regional finalist.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

Their actions made history but Dungannon’s pivotal role in the quest for social justice was soon forgotten as images of beaten and bloodied marchers on the Duke Street march that October grabbed headlines around the world.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDungannon-born presenter Lynette Fay with Bernadette McAliskey during recording for Stories in Sound: In The Footsteps, due to be broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster this Sunday (August 19) at 12.30pm\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBorn in Dungannon only a decade later, presenter Lynette Fay had no idea that people she knew growing up – her brother’s primary school teacher, and her next door neighbours – were among the organisers of that first march.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn this Stories In Sound documentary for BBC Radio Ulster, she follows ‘In The Footsteps’ of those first civil rights marchers. She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost. Fifty years on from that first civil rights march, how has Dungannon – and Northern Ireland – changed?\n\nIn the Footsteps - presented by Lynette Fay and produced by Freya McClements – is broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster on Sunday, August 19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602191.1534343875!/image/image.jpg","title":"fundraising in memory of elizabeth","story":"\nElizabeth Adams was an employee of Mountvale Private Nursing Home, Dromore for over 11 years, she was a work colleague but mainly a friend.  \n\n                \nAfter a short illness called Sarcoidosis, she passed away peacefully on January 15.

Since its formation in 1994, the initiative has sent over 2000 students from Northern Ireland to all four corners of the United States where they have successfully completed a year studying\n\nJonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland, added: “I am confident that the students departing for the US this year will be great ambassadors for Northern Ireland and will help to further important long-term links and connections. A recent report published by the British Council has highlighted that the relationship between the US and the UK is driven as much by cultural factors, as political with programmes such as Study USA supporting these links and strengthening them for the future. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Through Study USA, students will have the opportunity to not only enhance their employability skills but also develop intercultural skills, which will help them to prepare to work in a global economy. We wish them success, and trust that new connections and friendships will be developed in the year ahead.”\n\nStudy USA is just one of many international opportunities available through British Council Northern Ireland.

As the years went on they became less and less involved, but they were still on our board of directors for a number of years.\n“As time went on we became more secular and we didn’t have that relationship with the Church anymore. But we’re still very grateful for them for setting it up and for identifying the huge need for counselling and support in this area, I suppose because Ardoyne was hit so hard by the conflict.\n“The Passionists worked tirelessly, and I remember sister Kathleen constantly bringing funders into a room and saying ‘You have got to fund this.’ Because there was very little funding in the early days she worked extremely hard to get us established, funded and working.\n“We have grown considerably, and we now deliver about 12,000 to 13,000 sessions a year to about 2,500 people. As well as operating from this site, we also work in a range of local schools and community venues. If someone wants to be seen or needs help somewhere else we can do that too.”\nNorma continued: “Our clinical practice is excellent. We have just been awarded BACP [British Association for Counselling and Psycho-therapy) accreditation for our services. Most counsellors are individually accredited by the BACP, but very few organisations carry the accreditation. We are one of only six in Northern Ireland to be accredited this year.”\nWith a degree in psychology and a professional background in both therapy and conflict resolution, Norma said that New Life felt like a place where she could make a difference.\nIn the past, she has worked at New Life as a sessional counsellor and her experience in play therapy has allowed her to help children and adults alike. New Life is one of the few organisations in the north that offers child and family therapy – services that Norma insists are vital for North Belfast.\n“I think in this area you are working with generations of people who have had things really difficult,” she said.\n“Personal safety was at risk throughout the Troubles and the area has grown up with generations and generations of high unemployment. Poverty, conflict and trauma have a huge impact, not just psychologically, but on a cellular level it impacts people physically.\n“Poverty also has a huge impact on children’s education and a number of different things, so we’re working with multiple issues for a lot of families and they are trying really hard to overcome those things. It has a massive impact on people’s self-esteem, so it’s almost a vicious cycle.”\nShe continued: “There is a lot of research that has come out recently into adverse experience in childhood and the impact that those have on physical health, mental health, and educational achievement. The aim is to try to tackle things early. I think that’s why we believe that child therapy is so important, because you’ve got to be working with children from an early age to begin to address their issues early on.\n“If you don’t catch certain things in childhood, sometimes you’re working with very difficult teenage years because it’s harder to intervene. Sometimes those teenagers will come back as adults and they will feel like they are ready to tackle the issue at that stage.\n“At any stage in life it’s encouraging to know that anything can be repaired. Our brains are wonderful organs and in many ways they have a great plasticity so you can address those issues, you just have to be motivated and have the right motivator to identify what that change might look like.\n“Not everybody needs counselling, sometimes a friend or a colleague or anyone you can connect with can transform things for you. Talking to anybody helps you and can help you, but counselling gives a framework and a focus for those who need it.\n“If you can catch people before they hit the crisis it’s much better. When you’re in a crisis your ability to think clearly, to support yourself or to act lessens, so it’s much harder to activate the changes you need. If you can get into counselling when you’re not in crisis then you’ll be able to change things more quickly, but counselling can really help. It helps you to clear your mind enough to realise what needs to happen next to take you out of crisis.”\nWhile New Life has come on leaps and bounds since it began, offering thousands of yearly counselling sessions, Norma admits that mental health charities, including New Life, need more support to effectively help those in need of support.\n“I think pre-Troubles we didn’t have nearly enough mental health services,” she said.\n“People were just in lockdown mode, they were just surviving. Since the peace process there has been a lot more services established. I think mental health services are still desperately underfunded in Northern Ireland given what we have come through.\n“For our service we have a six-month waiting list and sometimes it can go up to a year. If you need a counsellor it’s way too long to wait, but we don’t have the funding to deliver any more sessions than we currently do.\n“I think there needs to be more accessible services. People get fed up sitting on a waiting list and a lot can happen in that space of time.”\nShe concluded: “If you do need someone to talk to it’s important that you come forward. Young people, especially can access our services quite quickly so we would really encourage them to come forward.”\nIf you think you might benefit from talking to New Life, call 90 391630.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tribute call for elisha scott","story":"\n\nTHE\n public vote to name the new road leading to the Olympia Leisure Centre in Belfast is in its final week and SDLP Councillor Donal Lyons is encouraging people to ensure they have their say and to vote for \u0026#8216Elisha Scott Boulevard\u0026#8217.\n\nElisha Scott is a Liverpool football legend and was Belfast Celtic’s most successful manager who also took the club on their tour of the US in 1949 where they defeated the then British champions, Scotland.\n\nCllr Donal Lyons said: “The vote to name this new road closes on this Sunday and the 125th anniversary of Elisha Scott’s birth will be on the 24th of this month, just days after. \n\n“I’m glad that my proposal to name this road after Elisha Scott has been included because despite Elisha being one of the most successful footballers to have come from our city, awareness of his achievements has faded. \n\n“It’s my hope, that by naming this road after Elisha Scott that we can correct this and begin to give him the full and long overdue recognition he deserves.”\n\nGoalkeeper Scott was born just yards from this new road. Cllr Lyons said it It would be fitting if the road was named after one of Belfast’s greatest ever footballers.\n\n“After famously signing for Liverpool FC in 1912 for ‘£1 and the price of the boat trip’, Scott would be a key player in Anfield for an incredible 22 years, making 468 first-team appearances. He holds the record as Liverpool’s longest serving player to this day. The earliest recorded football chant was Liverpool fans cheering his name. Scott is widely considered the first King of the Kop. \n\n“But it’s not just his time in Liverpool that’s worthy of celebrating. Elisha returned to the Donegall Road in 1934 to become player-manager for Belfast Celtic. Over the following 14 years, he would secure 31 trophies with the Grand Old Team, including 10 Irish League titles, six Irish Cups and eight Gold Cups. Belfast Celtic were the powerhouse in local football and the club still retains a loyal and dedicated fan base. \n\n“Scott also knew what mattered in football and when challenged amid worsening sectarian tensions in the 1930s, for fielding a cross community team he responded in his trademark forthright style, ‘I don’t play Protestant players. I don’t play Catholic players. I play good players.’ Scott’s success as both player and manager secured his place in history but his dedication to his club, players and fans ensured his place as a legend of the game.”\n\nYou can vote online at https://dof.belfastcity.gov.uk/NameTheRoadVote/  or by emailing NameTheRoad@BelfastCity.gov.uk with Elisha Scott in the subject and including your name and address.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"30 years on ballygawley bus","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Those who are his children will receive their heavenly reward, while the wicked, the murderers, will have their place in the fires that burn for all eternity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHundreds of people have attended a memorial service for the victims of the Ballygawley bus bombing marking 30 years since the County Tyrone attack - Credit: Arthur Allison/Pacemaker Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But here\u0027s what has to change... no more betrayal of the innocent victims of terrorism, no more empty promises, no more flawed agreements, no more appeasement of terrorists.\"\n\nHe added: \"Those who carried out this atrocity had a choice.\n\n\"They chose, because of some twisted ideology, to commit murder.\n\n\"What happened afterwards in their twisted minds was to them a cause for glorification.\"\n\nA new memorial to those who lost their lives was also unveiled at the roadside during the service. It includes descriptive panels explaining what happened on the night.\n\nAs well as survivors and relatives of the victims, some of the first responders and medical staff who treated the wounded attended.\n\nAmong the first people on the scene were members of the Omagh Protestant Boys\u0027 Flute Band and the Londonderry Star of the Valley band, who were returning from a parade in Portadown.\n\nThey had been travelling in buses just behind the soldiers.\n\nA church service to honour the dead also took place at Newtownsaville afterwards.\n\nThe dead were Jason Burfitt (19) Richard Greener (21) Mark Morsworthy (18) Stephen Wilkinson (18) Jason Winter (19) Blair Bishop (19) Alexander Lewis (18), and Peter Bullock (21).\n\nSince the bombing, five survivors have taken their own lives.\n\nAmong those in the crowd was James Leatherbarrow, who suffered a broken back after being thrown from the bus in the blast.\n\n\"They were my mates, they still are,\" he said.\n\nMr Leatherbarrow, from Liverpool, was looked after on the roadside that night by two women from Derry - Donna Patton and Grace Curry - who sat with him while waiting for the emergency services.\n\nIt took him until 2015 to get back on to a bus as years suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) tore his life apart.\n\n\"I was an evil so and so. It turned me into a person I didn\u0027t want to be,\" he admitted.\n\n\"I had nightmares, flashbacks, depression, years of heavy drinking and was very, very angry.\n\n\"I was physically and mentally abusive to people and mentally and verbally abusive to my first wife.\"\n\nMr Leatherbarrow, now 51, twice tried to take his own life, but battled through and has come out the other side.\n\nNow married again with three children, he has had a positive effect on another IRA victim, Manchester man Neil Tattersall, who joined him and his family in making the trip to Ballygawley for the service.\n\nMr Tattersall was the worst injured victim of an IRA attack in Manchester when two bombs exploded on December 3, 1992 - one close to Kendals department store, the other near the city\u0027s cathedral.\n\nSome 65 people were injured and Mr Tattersall was hit with shrapnel through the base of his spine.\n\n\"They couldn\u0027t move me so I was in the zone where nobody could go and there were police officers looking after me there,\" he said.\n\n\"Long-term it\u0027s not just the injuries to my spine, it\u0027s what it\u0027s done to my mind, the post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\"It was a chance meeting with James three years ago that changed my life.\n\n\"At that time I was homeless with a history of ruined relationships.\n\n\"It was only going to end one way and it wasn\u0027t good. But I was invited to a victims\u0027 meeting in Manchester.\n\n\"I didn\u0027t want to go, but forced myself.\n\n\"The room was full of people with Irish accents and I wasn\u0027t comfortable.\n\n\"I nipped out for a cigarette and James was there.\n\n\"He took one look at me and said: \u0027You\u0027ve got PTSD\u0027. Since that day we\u0027ve been the best of friends.\n\n\"He\u0027s helped me get my life back together.\"\n\nMr Leatherbarrow said: \"It was obvious to me he was suffering.\n\n\"We got together, helped each other and we\u0027re standing together today.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany.

We deserve better and we should bulldoze the place.”\n\nStormont has been suspended for months in a row between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists over identity issues like the Irish language.\n\nIn the 1960s, Ms McAliskey was a leading figure in the student civil rights movement, which drew inspiration from similar action in the US.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association highlighted discrimination against Catholics over issues like jobs and housing and sought voting rights for all.\n\nMany unionists felt it aimed to create a united Ireland.\n\n\n\nWe are the victims of sectarianism, the whole community, and we are the beneficiaries of racism\nBernadette McAliskey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nMs McAliskey said racism and sectarianism were like rapidly spreading ragweed.\n\n“If you take your eye off them in any time or place or generation they will reassert themselves, every single day.”\n\nShe said people do not understand racism in the way they do sectarianism.\n\n“We are the victims of sectarianism, the whole community, and we are the beneficiaries of racism.\n\n“We have to change how we view the past, not simply how we view the present or the future, or we don’t understand the need to fundamentally change.”\n\nShe said legislation addressing racism is not enforced properly and claimed Stormont had treated the Human Rights Commission with “abject disrespect” and failed to create a Northern Ireland Human Rights Act.\n\n“We are fundamentally racist. We think we know a great deal of history and we know none.”\n\nA march is planned from Coalisland to Dungannon on Saturday afternoon retracing the route of the original parade of the civil rights era amid protests about unionist discrimination in the allocation of housing.\n\nIt was a reaction to the earmarking of Dungannon public housing to a single Protestant woman with less housing need than many Catholic families on the waiting list.\n\nAustin Currie MP had squatted in a house in Caledon earlier in 1968 in protest and that led to the first of many civil rights marches, some of which attracted violence and heralded the start of the Troubles.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"house of fraser web shoppers in limbo as 500m","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

For items less than £100, you may be able to use your debit or credit card provider\u0027s Chargeback scheme,\" he said.\n\nThe comments came as it was revealed House of Fraser owed more than £484m to creditors including top designer brands Armani, Diesel, Prada and Gucci. \n\nAnd Sports Direct chief Mike Ashley, who bought out House of Fraser, will not be footing the bill for any money owed before his £90m rescue last Friday.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ifa now eyes other big events after boxing proves a knockout","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It\u0027s a mistake.\" \n\nWhile the Pope is not travelling to Northern Ireland, politicians from all the main parties here will join the celebrations - with the exception of the DUP. \n\nParty leader Arlene Foster declined her invitation saying she would be on a family holiday at the time, and the DUP has said it will not be sending another member in her place. \n\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood and Sinn Fein\u0027s Michelle O\u0027Neill are both expected to travel to Dublin to see the pontiff. \n\nThe UUP and Alliance will be sending representatives.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"religious imposter free presbyterian church urges followers to reject popes visit","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Free Presbyterian Church has called on its followers to avoid next week\u0027s Papal visit to Ireland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nPope Francis will address a gathering at Phoenix Park in Dublin next weekend, with 250,000 people also expected to attend events at the RDS, Croke Park and Knock. \n\nIt will be the first visit by a pope to Ireland since John Paul II in 1979. \n\nAhead of his arrival, the Free Presbyterian Church has said a \"love for the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ\" should prevent any Bible believer \"from union or communion with a Roman Catholic Church that remains as contrary to Holy Scripture today as it ever has been\". \n\n\n\n\nStage set for Pope’s visit to Ireland\n\n\n\n\n\nModerator\u0027s meeting with Pope comes under attack\n\n\n\n\nThe Free Presbyterian objection to the Pope\u0027s visit is based on its recognition of Jesus Christ as the only head of the church, and the rejection of the Catholic Church having a supreme head of the church on earth. \n\nIts statement reads: \"As long as it proclaims its leader as the supreme head of the church on earth, denigrates the work that Christ completed on Calvary by the pretentious teachings central to its mass, refuses the scriptural way of salvation that justification is by faith alone in Christ alone, fleeces its adherents by means of an imaginary purgatory, and offers indulgences with as much aplomb as Tetzel managed in Martin Luther’s day, no true Christian should engage in fellowship with this system, never mind travel to welcome its Pope.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe statement also takes aim at the decision by the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church to attend the visit and meeting with the Pontiff. \n\n\"How can the Presbyterian Church of Ireland present its recent vote in favour of its Moderator participating in the upcoming Papal visit as anything other than a betrayal of our Lord Jesus Christ?\" the statement reads. \n\nThe Free Presbyterian Church was founded by former DUP leader Ian Paisley in 1951 after a split with the Presbyterian Church, and has around 15,000 members, holding conservative positions on a number of social issues including same-sex marriage. \n\nIn 1988 Ian Paisley, then serving as the Church\u0027s moderator, was infamously dragged from the European Parliament chamber in Strasbourg while heckling Pope

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"temporary morgues planned for popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards.

Here is all you need to know about the crisis at HMP Birmingham.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\n\nWhat did the inspection find?\n\n\nThe prisons inspector warned the privately-run jail, managed by G4S, had seriously deteriorated in the last 18 months. Levels of violence were the highest for any local jail in the country, with some inmates saying they felt unsafe even behind locked cell doors.\n\nStaff at the category B facility were found asleep or locked in offices, while blatant use of illegal substances went largely unchallenged. Concerns had been raised internally that prisoners, rather than staff, appeared to be controlling many of the wings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat has the Government said?\n\n\nPrisons Minister Rory Stewart said the situation was “unacceptable” and that it had “become clear that drastic action is required to bring about the improvements we require”.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nHas HMP Birmingham been in trouble before?\n\n\nThe prison was the scene of a major riot in December 2016 that was believed to have caused more than £2 million-worth of damage.\n\nA report in June 2017 highlighted fighting on wings caused by easy access to drugs, with inmates concerned about high levels of violence.\n\nThree months later staff were involved in a seven-hour stand-off with inmates after they refused to return to their cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRiot police were deployed at the prison to deal with a disturbance in December 2016 (PA)\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is held at HMP Birmingham?\n\n\nThe prison for adult male inmates had a population of 1,269 at the end of July. Built in 1849, the remand prison holds inmates while they await trial for alleged offences.\n\nOn average, inmates spend around six weeks there before being transferred to other jails.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHMP Birmingham is one of more than a dozen privately-run prisons in the UK (PA)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is G4S?\n\n\nGlobal security giant G4S holds contracts to provide services across the UK justice system. It is the largest secure outsourcing company in the country.\n\nG4S became the first private company to take over a public prison in the UK when it assumed control of HMP Birmingham in 2011.\n\nThe publicly-traded company reported £139 million in pre-tax profits in the first six months of 2018, with revenue of £3.67 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG4S holds contracts for services across the British justice system (PA)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat has G4S said?\n\n\nJerry Petherick, managing director of G4S Custody \u0026 Detention Services, said HMP Birmingham faced “exceptional challenges” including “increasingly high levels of prisoner violence towards staff and fellow prisoners”.\n\nThe company said it welcomed the Government’s intervention and “the opportunity to work with the Ministry of Justice to urgently address the issues faced at the prison”.\n\n\nAre there many private jails?\n\n\nExcluding HMP Birmingham there are 13 “contracted-out” prisons in the UK. Private prisons were introduced in the 1990s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"greenpeace blockades volkswagens uk headquarters","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

[]).push({})\n\n\nPilgrims stood shoulder to shoulder for an emotional day of repentance and supplication at the site where Muslims believe the Prophet Mohammed delivered his final sermon, calling for equality and for Muslims to unite.\n\nAccording to the hadiths, traditional collections of the prophet’s sayings and anecdotes about his life, Mohammed also reminded his followers of women’s rights and that every Muslim life and property is sacred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn elderly Muslim pilgrim walks with her daughter to their bus (Dar Yasin/AP)\n\n\n\n\nMuslims believe prayer on this day at Mount Arafat, about 12 miles east of the holy city of Mecca, is their best chance to erase past sins and start anew.\n\nAround sunset on Monday, pilgrims will head to an area called Muzdalifa, which is 5.5 miles west of Arafat.\n\nMany walk, while others use buses.\n\nThey spend the night there and pick up pebbles along the way that will be used in a symbolic stoning of the devil back in the city of Mina, where Muslims believe the devil tried to talk Ibrahim out of submitting to God’s will.\n\nThe kingdom has spent billions of dollars of its vast oil revenues on security and safety measures, particularly in Mina, where some of the hajj’s deadliest incidents have occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuslim pilgrim prepare to get on the bus (Dar Yasin/AP)\n\n\n\n\nThe worst in recorded history took place only three years ago.\n\nOn September 24 2015, a stampede and crush of pilgrims in Mina killed at least 2,426 people, according to an Associated Press count.\n\nThe official Saudi toll of 769 people killed and 934 injured has not changed since only two days after the tragedy.\n\nThe kingdom has never addressed the discrepancy in the casualty toll, nor has it released any results of an investigation that authorities had promised to conduct over the disaster.\n\nThe five-day hajj pilgrimage represents one of the world’s biggest gatherings every year, and is required of all able-bodied Muslims once in their life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuslim pilgrims along with their belongings walks towards Namirah mosque on Arafat Mountain (Dar Yasin/AP)\n\n\n\n\nAt the hajj’s end, male pilgrims will shave their hair and women will cut a lock of hair in a sign of renewal for completing the pilgrimage.\n\nAround the world, Muslims will mark the end of hajj with a celebration called Eid al-Adha.\n\nThe holiday, remembering Ibrahim’s willingness to sacrifice his son, sees Muslims slaughter sheep and cattle, distributing the meat to the poor.\n\nOvernight, a sandstorm packing strong winds and thunderstorms roared through Mecca.\n\nOfficials say the severe weather slightly damaged some tents housing pilgrims, but caused no injuries.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds local witches gather guildhall launch derrys week long halloween celebrations","story":"\nDerry’s ancient Walls became a sea of pointy hats this evening as a coven of hundreds of witches came together to launch the programme for this year’s world famous Halloween celebration in the city.\n\nThe 2018 event will run from 26th October – 3rd November 2018, with over 100 family friendly activities at more than 40 venues, stretching over eight jam-packed days.\n\nThe theme for this year’s Carnival Parade is Return of the Ancients, looking back to the Pagan origins of Hallowe’en which reach far back to the times of Cúchulainn and Fionn MacCool and beyond.\n\nLaunching the event, the Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor John Boyle, said the gathering of witches perfectly conjured up some of the magical atmosphere which has made Derry Halloween renowned across the world.\n\n“I was delighted to see so many people donning their pointy hats and hopping on their broomsticks to join in the launch this evening. It really captures the true spirit of the event which has always belonged to the people of this city who go to such great lengths to put on a show every year.\n\n“This year we also celebrate 400 years of the City’s magnificent Walls which play such a key part in our celebrations and we can look forward to another spellbinding celebration and an extended festival with plenty for everyone, young and old, to enjoy.\n\n“Be warned, accommodation always gets booked up fast, so anyone travelling should plan their trip now.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027243184\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\nAmong the regular highlights which draw thousands to the city each year, is the Awakening of the Walls, which makes a welcome return for 2018.\nAs we celebrate four centuries since the building of the city’s stunning ramparts, watch as they come alive with an illuminated animation trail on and around the City Walls from October 28-30.\n\nThe Guildhall will once again be at the centre of the celebrations with the magical Museum of the Moon bathing the Main Hall in its ethereal light for seven days, and where the Samhain Sessions will showcase some fantastic musical talent under its ghostly glow.\n\nUp to 1000 people will be taking part in the carnival parade which is always the main highlight of the programme and a mass community celebration for all. Following the spectacular carnival celebrations and fireworks finale on October 31st, just when you thought it was all over, on November 1st the Walls will once again become the setting for First Light, which will bring the community together for a special celebration of light, remembrance and renewal.\n\nAdd to this story-telling, ghost tours, the Jack-O-Lantern Festival, the Monster Funfair, Little Horrors, Shape Shifter costume and make up workshops and the haunted Harvest Market, and you have the secret formula for the best Halloween celebration in the world.\n\nLooking ahead to the event, Festivals and Events officer with Council, Liz Cunningham, said: “Tonight’s gathering of witches gives just a hint of what’s to come, and really shows how much the people of the city have made this celebration their own. We are thrilled that so many wicked witches turned up for some fun this evening. This year we’ve extended our programme, making it our biggest celebration to date, and we just look forward now to showing the world how it’s done.”\n\nYou can find out more about all the spooktacular celebrations on derryhalloween or follow @DerryHalloween on social media #DerryHalloween\n\nEnds\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new mission centre run franciscan friars replace community hall derry closed","story":"\nA Derry community centre which closed down is now set to be brought back into use after ambitious plans were lodged for its redevelopment.\n\nSt Joseph’s Parish Centre in the Galliagh area is now to be redeveloped as a ‘Mission Centre’ after an application was lodged with Derry City and Strabane District Council for the redevelopment of the building.\n\nThe application, which was lodged by the Franciscan Friars, will see the demolition of part of the building to be replaced by a new build.\n\nThe proposal states that the new development will be used as Friars Mission Centre, ‘providing for running of courses, activities for school groups, youth clubs, together with provision of support for people in need of same’.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027243295\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\nSpeaking to the Derry News yesterday, the SDLP councillor for the area welcomed the progress on the proposal.\n\n“It’s good to see these plans progress, as this building has been closed for some time now, and it will be a positive move for the local community to see it brought back into use,” Cllr Tierney said.\n\n“The new centre will also benefit the young people living in the Galliagh area, and also help to bring new investment in youth services and schemes for young people.”\n\nThe plans will be considered by the local council’s Planning Committee in the autumn.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein derry call meenan square site bosgide cleaned secured soon possible","story":"\nSinn Féin Foyle MLA Karen Mullan has called for the derelict Meenan Square complex which has been the site of much anti-community activity to be cleaned up and secured as soon as possible.\n\nThe site was used to light a controversial bonfire in the city on Wednesday night.\n\nKaren Mullan said: “Councillor Patricia Logue and I are calling for Meenan Square site to be cleaned up and secured as soon as possible.\n\n“We will be meeting with all stakeholders to move the project along, funding is in place for this site and is an Urban Villages Key Project and we request that all efforts are put in place to move this forward.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027243236\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\n“We are also calling on the owner of the site to step up to his responsibility and work closely with the community.\n\n“The well-publicized issues with this site have have been ongoing now for a number of years, the local community cannot go through another of summer this.
