That was not cool at all.’It’s common knowledge that the star is a huge fan of the Japanese culture, especially the children’s TV series Pokemon, as she previously claimed her favourite Pokemon was Bulbasaur .Talking to the Independent she answered of her favourite: ‘Bulbasaur because he’s sassy and he’s a good friend and his vines would help me reach whatever I want.’Before adding: ‘Also, Jigglypuff as he can sing and that could help me to sleep, as I’m having trouble sleeping because I’m over excited about everything that’s happening.‘Also he paints on peoples faces when they’re asleep which I’ve done too. Finally… Snorlax. He’s fat and amazing.’However, some fans picked up on her love for the Japanese culture, and showed their support for the star who was seemingly showing her love.Someone wrote: ‘Its not cultural appropriation as long as it is done with admiration of the culture.

One fan does it well.They said: ‘Phoebe would stick with Monica who would’ve stuck with Carol. Joey would stick with Phoebe, and to be honest, Chandler and Joey were much closer than Ross was with Chandler. Rachel would go with Carol because in this universe, she would’ve met Carol and Susan instead of Ross.’It’s not all that far fetched when you think it about it that way, making the whole show completely different had Carol been in the clique (even though, one hole was found in the above explanation, as we know Rachel had already met Ross during high school, still she was friends with Monica, so that one is a moo point).And fans were shaken not stirred about the whole thing as their whole universe collided like it was in the Hadron.Not everyone was sold on this theory, though.‘The theory is debunked by the episode that shows them before Rachel when it was a group of four,’ one began. ‘Ross, Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe would hang out at the bar that would become Central Perk cafe before even Joey moved in.’Another said: ‘That’s not true.. The whole show is based on them been brother and sister. Or how else would they have all met each other?

Prince Albert had projected in 2016 that the restoration project would take at least a year to complete, and he was pretty close on his estimateNow with two children of his own, he told People magazine at the time that he purchased the property that he can\u0027t wait to make new memories there with his own children, twins Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella.\u0027I\u0027m looking forward to showing the house to the kids, sharing it with them, having them see the garden,\u0027 he said. He projected then that the restoration project would take at least a year to complete, and he was pretty close on his estimate.          Prince Albert and his family worked from top to bottom over the past year-and-a-half to make sure the home properly conveyed the emotional and historical significance it holds for them          On the second floor, four bedrooms including the one where Princess Grace spent her younger years brought back memories for the Prince          Prince Albert gave a tour of the refinished property to the Today Show          Princess Grace Kelly is seen here on January 10, 1956, with her fiance Prince Rainier of Monaco          Prince Rainier III of Monaco and Oscar winner Grace Kelly pose for photographers at the home of Kelly\u0027s parents after the pair\u0027s engagement was announced on January 5, 1956          Prince Rainier of Monaco and film actress Grace Kelly show off the engagement ring to her mother at the home of Kelly\u0027s parents a few days after their announcement          Next to the den, there\u0027s bar which the family referred to as \u0027Kelly Tavern\u0027 Next to the den, there\u0027s a bar which the family referred to as \u0027Kelly Tavern.\u0027 An oar that is believed to have belonged to Princess Grace\u0027s father hangs today above the bar, where the point of his scull is also displayed.In addition to the restorative work, irreplaceable personal touches somehow remained throughout the residence, like the linen closet floor on the second floor that survived with etching of the Kelly children\u0027s heights clearly visible, from two years old to their late teens.          Prince Albert shows Kotb one of the irreplaceable personal touches that somehow remained throughout the residence, like the linen closet floor on the second floor          The linen closet door survived with etchings of the Kelly children\u0027s heights clearly visible, from two years old to their late teens          Though he was thankful the memories were preserved unscathed, Prince Albert couldn\u0027t really offer much of an explanation for the still-standing treasure          \u0027Maybe they thought we were going to take it back one day,\u0027 he said, suggesting previous owners might have realized its importance to the history of the familyThough he was thankful the memories were preserved unscathed, Prince Albert couldn\u0027t really offer much of an explanation for the still-standing treasure.\u0027Maybe they thought we were going to take it back one day,\u0027 he said, suggesting previous owners might have realized its importance to the history of the family. That is a sweet thought, but it\u0027s not likely all of the previous owners had such charming intentions in the back of their minds.The property made headlines in 2014 when its 81-year-old former owner pleaded no contest to animal cruelty charges for keeping cats and dogs in unsanitary conditions on the property.Officials with the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals seized 15 cats from the home and found the remains of several others.The owner had lived in the large brick house since 1973.          Though it\u0027s restored now, the Kelly home made headlines in 2014 when its 81-year-old former owner pleaded no contest to animal cruelty charges for keeping cats and dogs in unsanitary conditions on the property          But today, it\u0027s back to its original beauty, sitting on a 0.69-acre (0.279-hectare) parcel that features gardens and a private backyard          Princess Grace, the former model from Philadelphia high society is shown here in a 1955 portrait during her Hollywood years          From the steps of her childhood home, Princess Grace of Monaco (1929 - 1982) waves with her family, from second left, her husband Rainier III, Prince of Monaco (1923 - 2005), Albert II, Prince of Monaco, and daughter Princess Caroline (later Caroline, Princess of Hanover), in Philadelphia in 1963Toby E Boshak, Executive Director of the Princess Grace Foundation-USA, described the painstaking attention paid by Prince Albert and his family, to protect the history of the Kelly home.They scoured over old family photos and videos to get each detail just right. \u0027There’s an old rug that used to be in the living room that was brought back,\u0027 Boshak said.\u0027They polished and restored all the finishes, keeping the originals when possible and matching older items that resembled the period of the house.\u0027Some had speculated the home, which was first built in 1928 by the Oscar winner\u0027s father, three-time Olympic gold medalist rower John B Kelly, might be turned into a museum.

Harry was fifth in line when he got engaged, but is now sixth with the birth of Prince Louis.If Harry failed to get the Queen\u0027s approval, he and his future descendants would be disqualified from succeeding to the Crown.           Although the Queen was unlikely to have withheld her blessing, she would only have said \u0027no\u0027 on the advice of the Prime Minister, whom she will have informed          For hundreds of years, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 required descendants of George II to seek the sovereign\u0027s consent before they wed, otherwise their marriages were deemed invalid          The Act was a radical shake-up of the rules of royal succession, removing male bias. Labour peer Lord Dubs once branded the law \u0027the Dangerous Dogs Act of its day\u0027, saying it was \u0027passed in haste owing to George III\u0027s chagrin that his relatives were getting married without consulting him\u0027          The document states: \u0027Now know ye that we have consented and do by these presents signify our consent to the contracting of matrimony between our most dearly beloved grandson Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales KCVO and Rachel Meghan Markle\u0027Family attacked after woman gave chocolates to childrenHANDS OFF!

But a Roman Catholic royal still cannot be king or queen.King George III, George II\u0027s grandson, ordered the now repealed 1772 Act after his younger brother - the Duke of Cumberland - secretly married Lady Anne Horton, deemed to be a highly disreputable widow of a commoner.Labour peer Lord Dubs once branded the law \u0027the Dangerous Dogs Act of its day\u0027, saying it was \u0027passed in haste owing to George III\u0027s chagrin that his relatives were getting married without consulting him\u0027.There is no requirement that royals marry someone of royal or aristocratic blood. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/12/22/4C259C1200000578-5721959-image-a-2_1526158973856.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles father STAGED photos paparazzi sold 100 000","story":"    Caught on CCTV, how Meghan\u0027s dad - and his paparazzi minder - scoped out an internet cafe, handed over cash and then staged \u0027snatched\u0027 photo of him gazing at an image of his girl with HarryIn one revealing frame, the photographer, just feet away on the other side of the cafe, can be seen aiming his lens at Mr Markle, who is peering at a photograph of the engaged couple.The staged photographs come despite Kensington Palace issuing a warning to publishers to respect Mr Markle’s privacy, saying he had been ‘harassed’ by paparazzi.A Mail on Sunday investigation has established that the internet cafe pictures are just part of a series Rayner took of Meghan’s father. They have been published in newspapers, magazines and on websites around the world.          1. Photographer Jeff Rayner, camera slung over his shoulder, arrives at the Omega internet cafe at 9.50am on March 27 with Thomas Markle          2. The photographer scans the computer booths for the best viewpoint as Mr Markle heads to the front counter to pay to get online  3. Mr Markle and the photographer book time to use one of the computers, but are secretly planning to choreograph a photoshootIn all of them Mr Markle appears to be unaware they are being taken. But we can today reveal they were in fact contrived and shot with his co-operation. It is not known if he was paid to take part.The faked images include Mr Markle apparently:Being measured for a suit to wear to the wedding – in fact the ‘tailor’ was an assistant at a party goods shop recruited for the job as the suit hire store the photographer planned to use was closed.Being caught browsing a book of British landmarks in a branch of Starbucks – although he actually arrived at the cafe with the photographer, and set up the shot.Working out with weights to get in shape for the big day – but the pictures appear to have been taken on a waste tip, an unlikely place to exercise but away from prying eyes.The revelation that Mr Markle has been co-operating with a paparazzo behind the backs of his daughter, Prince Harry and Kensington Palace officials will cause huge embarrassment to the Royal Family in the run-up to the wedding. It will be galling for Harry who, in a BBC documentary last year, hit out at the paparazzi for the way in which they pursued his mother, Princess Diana. She was killed in Paris in 1997 after being chased by photographers.And shortly after his relationship with Meghan became public in 2016, the Prince made a heartfelt plea for the media to respect the privacy of Meghan and her family.Last night, just hours ahead of our exposé, represenatives of Mr Markle wrote to editors around the world and to British newspaper watchdog the Independent Press Standards Organisation. Editors were told that he was suffering as a result of media intrusion and did not want to participate in photocalls or interviews.          4. In this grainy image, the figure of Mr Markle sitting at a desk in front of a computer screen can just about be made out, while behind him Rayner uses his long lens to capture pictures he later sells for sizeable fees          5. Rayner trains his lens on Mr Markle, who is in the corner of the cafe, reading stories about Harry and Meghan but looking at the screen at an odd angle          ... to produce this lucrative shot which was flogged to the world\u0027s unsuspecting mediaKensington Palace officials did the same a few weeks before. An official letter, written by Prince Harry’s communications secretary Jason Knauf, described how Mr Markle had been ‘followed and harassed’ by photographers and journalists. The letter urged editors not to publish pictures of Mr Markle and called on them to stop pursuing him.Mail on Sunday reporters have established that Mr Markle and Rayner, a 44-year-old Los Angeles-based photographer, set up at least four photoshoots. Mr Markle is seen wearing identical clothes in different sets of pictures, suggesting different ‘scenarios’ were possibly staged on the same day.Will it be the Duke and Duchess of SUSSEX?

Such was the effect that Miss Watson needed a moment to compose herself. She was concerned about her horizontal interviewee \u0027transgressing any social rules\u0027, as she demurely put it. But the performance was not yet over. No sooner had she begun the interview than Wilde\u0027s valet burst in with an album that urgently needed the aesthete\u0027s autograph. Oscar waved away the obligation, saying with heavy innuendo: \u0027I am too much engaged just now.\u0027 His intention seemed clear – Oscar the journalist\u0027s prey had become Oscar the hunter.Today, Wilde\u0027s semi-seduction of his interviewer seems as unsubtle as it is peculiar. Could this be the same man who was to become history\u0027s most celebrated gay martyr? Why was he so set on stirring up female desire?The answer lies in his early life when Wilde discovered the effect his seductive charms could have on women – and how he exploited it to his own advantage as he made a name for himself as a writer.Two wives, a poster of Marilyn Monroe on his bathroom door...From a cheeky schoolboy posing next to his sisters, to...Share this articleIndeed, so successful was Wilde the womaniser that he became the object of widespread obsession, driving his female fans half-crazy with desire and enraging fathers and husbands who feared the effect he was having on women\u0027s morals.Never was this Wilde-mania more apparent than on a year-long lecture tour of America, which saw him surrounded by the sort of celebrity hype now reserved for teenage boy bands.The year was 1882, long before the affair with Lord Alfred \u0027Bosie\u0027 Douglas that was to prove his downfall. Back then, Wilde\u0027s sexuality was still in flux, although he had already developed a reputation as something of a ladies\u0027 man.As a student at Oxford University, he had persuaded a young woman to sit on his lap. Her mother entered the room and caught the pair together. Later, she caught Wilde kissing her daughter in the hallway. \u0027Oscar,\u0027 the mother scolded, \u0027the thing was neither right, nor manly, nor gentlemanlike in you.\u0027          Today, Wilde\u0027s semi-seduction of his interviewer seems as unsubtle as it is peculiarThere were plenty more willing to take the girl\u0027s place. Among them were Florence Balcombe, who would go on to marry Dracula author Bram Stoker, and Violet Hunt, an auburn-haired writer who Wilde promised: \u0027We will rule the world, you and I – you with your looks and I with my wits.\u0027In truth, after leaving Oxford in 1878, Wilde struggled to find a niche. \u0027I\u0027ll be a poet, a writer, a dramatist. Somehow or other I\u0027ll be famous, and if not famous, I\u0027ll be notorious,\u0027 he told friends.He set about trying all these careers in turn (and a few more besides) while living on the modest sum of £200 a year after his father\u0027s death. He curried favour among those who might be able to help him, iding his attention between prominent figures in education and art. On one occasion, he offered his services as a personal shopper with an excellent taste in neckties.For all his hustling, he was hardly making a living, let alone making his name. But then came his break: struck by his dandyish demeanour, Punch magazine made him the face of Aestheticism – an artistic movement concerned with poetry and beauty – and from this, Wilde\u0027s reputation began to grow.Soon after, he was offered a US lecture tour by impresario Richard D\u0027Oyly Carte, whose production of Gilbert and Sullivan\u0027s comic opera Patience – which satirised Aestheticism – was touring America. Who better to help promote it than the man who was the very personification of the movement?Wilde\u0027s motives for accepting Carte\u0027s offer were equally mercenary. His first play, Vera, had failed and his finances were stretched. The invitation could not have come at a better time.And so on Christmas Eve 1881, Wilde, then aged 27, wrapped himself in a fur cloak and boarded the SS Arizona at Liverpool.LEGEND has it that on his arrival in the United States in 1882, Wilde breezed through customs by telling officials: \u0027I have nothing to declare but my genius.\u0027There is no firm proof that he uttered those words – the anecdote was first recorded 30 years later –but what is certainly true is that Wilde and his advisers soon discovered that America adored him and that sex sells.Wherever the young, handsome aesthete went, crowds of adoring women would follow. So great were their number in New York that policemen were forced to hold the crowds back so that Wilde could find a path through them. Despite questions over his sexuality from critics – one, with a veiled nod towards his homosexuality, branded Wilde an example of \u0027unmanly manhood\u0027 – female groupies clustered outside his hotels.Word of Wilde\u0027s powers of attraction quickly spread, with lecture halls packed full of women less interested in his quick wit and artistic insights than in gazing at his long raven hair, his elegantly turned legs, the tightness of his trousers and the smoothness of his cheeks.At 6ft 4in and about 14st, he cut an imposing yet elegant figure. And Wilde revelled in the attention. Audiences gossiped about his \u0027mashing\u0027 – late 19th Century American slang for arranging himself in seductive poses and behaving as a womaniser.          And so on Christmas Eve 1881, Wilde, then aged 27, wrapped himself in a fur cloak and boarded the SS Arizona at LiverpoolA thumbnail biographical sketch sold on trains told of how fathers watched in amazement as, before their eyes, their daughters became \u0027love-sick maidens\u0027 who declared Wilde a \u0027perfect raving angel\u0027. Their righteous indignation was whipped up by newspapers, which gleefully reported the worrying effect Wilde\u0027s lectures could have on otherwise-upstanding ladies.Satirists mocked the mood of hysteria. Men swore they\u0027d make him pay for being \u0027the perverter of our wives by means of your idiotic art twaddle\u0027, according to one US newspaper.Naturally, Wilde had little patience for such complaints. \u0027America is the only country in the world where Don Juan is not appreciated,\u0027 he countered, while pronouncing on women\u0027s looks as if conducting his own personal Miss America contest. \u0027I am obliging beautiful young ladies,\u0027 he said, as he signed autographs for his female admirers in front of the man from the Albany Argus newspaper. \u0027I make it a point to grant my autograph to no others.\u0027His unlikely Lothario act sent sales of his literary works soaring. Only a year earlier, English critics had turned up their noses at Wilde\u0027s poems. Now his American admirers were snapping them up.Lines excised from the English edition of his poems for being too risque were included in the US versions, adding to his notoriety. His verses turned nature into an erotic playground.Under Wilde\u0027s influence, a yellow iris offers its throat to a dragonfly\u0027s kisses, trees stoop to peck a swooning nymph, and lilies air-kiss the wind. But it was what he appeared to be confessing about his own love life that fascinated Americans. \u0027I am too young to live without desire,\u0027 one poem declared. Every line fuelled his fans\u0027 fantasies, with composers of popular music doing their utmost to capitalise on the hype with songs dedicated to Wilde-mania.Former journalist Monroe Rosenfeld captured the mood perfectly with a rowdy song called Oscar Dear! that soon became a hit. It was an invented story full of innuendo about a character called Oscar, his wandering hands, and the girl who loved him despite them. It cheerfully encouraged men to find their inner Oscar and to become, as the song put it, \u0027just a little wild\u0027.\u0027Oscar dear, Oscar dear,How flutterly-utterly-flutter you are.Oscar dear, Oscar dear,I think you are awfully wild.\u0027By the time Wilde returned to London in January 1883, his celebrity was assured. An eager public snapped up every morsel of gossip about their idol and swallowed them so quickly that their truth was rarely questioned.          His unlikely Lothario act sent sales of his literary works soaring. Only a year earlier, English critics had turned up their noses at Wilde\u0027s poems. Now his American admirers were snapping them upThis, ironically, plumped up his reputation to such an extent that it gave him the financial means to marry the daughter of a leading barrister a year later.\u0027I am going to be married to a beautiful young girl called Constance Lloyd,\u0027 Oscar told actress and socialite Lillie Langtry. He was as elated as his bride-to-be.He designed her engagement ring himself, forming a heart from pearls and diamonds (his favourite gemstone). He also gave her a pet monkey to keep her company while they were apart.But during the summer of 1891, poet Lionel Johnson dropped in on the Wildes and brought along Lord Alfred Douglas, an angel-faced 21-year-old Oxford student who went by the nickname \u0027Bosie\u0027.Wilde was instantly infatuated. He treated him to tea and then introduced him to Constance.The illicit love story between Oscar and Bosie began that very day – with the shattering consequences that are so well known.When it came in 1895, Oscar\u0027s unmaking was swift and grim. Shamed in court for \u0027the love that dare not speak its name\u0027, he was stripped of his possessions, publicly humiliated, estranged from his wife and two young sons, imprisoned and forced to carry out menial tasks and hard labour for two years.The face of Aestheticism became prisoner C.3.3.Such was his ignominy that after his release he took a new name and lived as Sebastian Melmoth. Oscar Wilde was no more.Long before his death in Paris in 1900, the man who had driven women wild with desire simply ceased to exist. Few dared to stage his plays. His literary reputation was in tatters.The greatest wit of the age had disappeared because society could not accept his sexuality.

Over the coming months, MPs will have the chance to table amendments to Bills – and vote for those amendments – which can prevent the country from suffering the long-term damage that a hard Brexit will cause. Parliamentarians who champion the hardest of Brexits will stubbornly resist any such amendments, and the pro-Brexit press will angrily protest, but what is the role of MPs if not to improve and protect the lives of their constituents? The referendum result did not hand the most ideologically fervent Brexiteers a mandate to take the UK out of the EU on any terms.That is why the three of us are joining forces to appeal to MPs from all parties to take back control of the direction of Brexit. Tomorrow, at the Tilda rice mill in Essex, we will call on Parliament to reject completely the siren calls to sever the UK\u0027s deep economic ties with the European Union. Cheerleaders for a hard Brexit insist it is the only way to forge a buccaneering future for our country as \u0027Global Britain\u0027.The swashbuckling rhetoric may sound exciting but the reality of the choice we face is far harder. For Tilda, an iconic British firm which has been based in the UK for four decades and sells rice in more than 50 countries, the alternatives to Customs Union membership do not guarantee the same level of barrier-free access for its products in the rest of the EU and will require the firm to relocate part of its processing unit.          The swashbuckling rhetoric may sound exciting but the reality of the choice we face is far harderCountless businesses across the UK are similarly troubled by the Government\u0027s failure to come up with a workable way forward. Whether you voted Leave or Remain this is a deeply worrying situation, and one which poses serious economic risks. The Government knows this. Its own analysis concluded that every post-Brexit scenario will come at a cost.Even a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU predicted the UK will see growth drop by 5 per cent over the next 15 years compared with current forecasts, as a result of additional bureaucratic border checks. The ensuing economic pain will be felt in every part of the country. This is not Project Fear it is project reality based on the Government\u0027s own analysis.Nor will any future bilateral deals, which the Government predicts will add just 0.2 to 0.7 per cent to GDP, be easy to secure, with other nations insisting upon their own regulatory and environmental standards, such as the American demand that UK consumers accept chlorine-treated chicken. In this volatile world, in which a protectionist US President threatens trade wars across the planet, is this really the time to go it alone?The truth is that Britain is already proudly, and powerfully, global. Under current arrangements we can trade with European countries but also, as a leading player in an ambitious bloc, with world nations. The EU is already in the process of striking wide-ranging deals with Japan, Canada, Singapore and Mexico, and the negotiating muscle of 27 nations is far more likely to achieve expanded trade with China and India. When it comes to trade, distant nations come into focus through the lens of the EU telescope. A hard, destructive Brexit reverses the telescope: those nations closest to us appear more distant, and those further away fade from view.          They must set aside party loyalties and place their constituents at the forefront of their minds. They must put our country firstOf course, important though the debate about our customs arrangements are, \u0027frictionless\u0027 trade is only possible if the UK is part of the level playing field of regulatory standards and barrier-free supply chains which the Single Market (or similar with the same benefits, as the Brexiteers promised us) provides. If the UK is on the outside then the services sector, which accounts for about 80 per cent of UK economy, will suffer, our global aspirations will be hindered and UK-wide economic harm will follow.A hard Brexit won\u0027t create Global Britain. Instead it is merely a path to a fantasy island where we will have reduced access to our largest markets and a diminished standing in the world. It is not just responsible, economically, to find a better way forward. It is profoundly in the national interest.So when MPs finally vote, at the end of this year, on the Government\u0027s Brexit \u0027deal\u0027, they will be grappling with questions which strike at the heart of our representative democracy and the future of Britain. Does Brexit improve their constituents\u0027 lives? Does the final deal match the promises made in the referendum? Will severing our economic ties with Europe create, or diminish, Global Britain?This will be a judgment which only elected representatives can take. Whatever party they belong to, and however their constituents voted in 2016, MPs must do what they believe is best for the future. They must set aside party loyalties and place their constituents at the forefront of their minds. They must put our country first. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/00/4C283F9D00000578-0-image-a-11_1526168254889.jpg","title":"Government ask straight couples want option having civil partnerships","story":"    Straight couples will be asked by the Government if they would like the option of having a civil partnership rather than getting marriedCouples will be granted a \u0027clickie orce\u0027 for just £550 on...Share this articleLast night, a spokeswoman for the Equal Civil Partnerships campaign said: \u0027If the government is allowed to have its way, it could be a decade or more before all couples have the same choice of marriage or civil partnership.\u0027Both the court of appeal and the government itself agree that the current situation is unfair and sustainable but all we are getting are delaying tactics. \u0027It\u0027s time to extend civil partnerships to all now.\u0027But Tom Pascoe, of the Marriage Coalition, said: \u0027Marriage remains the gold standard for adult relationships.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/12/22/4C22327F00000578-0-image-m-62_1526160904123.jpg","title":"A sobering thought Women know wines better men struggle study reveals","story":"    It is a sobering thought for all men who think they know the difference between a decent red and cheap plonk – women make far better wine-tasters (stock image)EXCLUSIVE: \u0027Lost tribe\u0027 of Britons cut off on a tiny island...Share this article"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/03/4C28F6BF00000578-5722707-Stan_Zimmerman-a-22_1526179659485.jpg","title":"Former Roseanne writers say perplexed shows right wing turn series reboot","story":"    The writer took issue with the latest episode (above), in which character Roseanne Connor fears her Muslim neighbors are terrorists, but then learns to accept them  Former writers Stan Zimmerman and Lois Bromfeld were both upset that Roseanne Barr and her character are Trump supporters, but said they were surprised at how good the reboot is\u0027I will challenge every sacred cow in USA\u0027: Roseanne defends...Tim Allen\u0027s TV show Last Man Standing is coming BACK to TV...Share this articleWriter Stan Zimmerman, who worked on Roseanne for two seasons, told the outlet: \u0027A lot of people involved in the show were surprised when she turned right-wing and supported Trump because that was just not the person or her character that we had known.\u0027 Although the reboot has never mentioned Trump by name, the first episode clearly signaled Roseanne Connor\u0027s support for him in her arguments with her liberal sister, saying that she liked \u0027that he talked about jobs\u0027. Barr has said it was her idea to make her character a Trump supporter, telling the New York Times: \u0027I just wanted to have that dialogue about families torn apart by the election and their political differences of opinion and how we handle it.\u0027 Four writers from the original run did return to work on the reboot, so the disgruntled sentiment is not universal. ABC, which airs the show, declined to comment to Buzzfeed, and representatives for Barr did not respond to requests for comment.The writers who did complain focused their criticism on the character\u0027s support for Trump.            \u0027I don\u0027t think that Roseanne Conner would\u0027ve voted for Donald Trump,\u0027 said Miriam Trogdon, (above) who worked on the show for two seasons          The show often depicts arguments between Roseanne Conner (left) and her Hillary-loving sister Jackie (center), though the characters manage to overcome their differences\u0027Roseanne is a really big supporter of women and human rights and animal rights,\u0027 Bromfield said. \u0027Roseanne is not a bigot, she\u0027s not a backward person at all, so her liking Trump is just so odd.

branding it \u0027crazy\u0027 and warning it would be a betrayal of the referendum vote.There are claims today that half the full Cabinet roster could also be opposed to the proposal - which would see the UK collect tariffs on behalf of Brussels and then offer businesses rebates.  Mr Coveney appeared to endorse Mrs May\u0027s vision of a partnership in an interview on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show.He said the UK had made a clear commitment in last December\u0027s agreed UK-EU text that there would be no physical infrastructure on the border.Boris Johnson (pictured attending Cabinet last week) launched an extraordinary public attack on Theresa May\u0027s post-Brexit trade plans          Mr Johnson responded to Mrs May\u0027s latest comments about Brexit on Twitter today\u0027That means we are not talking about cameras and scanning systems and drones here - it means we are talking about a political solution that allows for regulatory alignment in a way that prevents the need for border infrastructure,\u0027 he said.\u0027We are simply asking that that commitment be followed through on.\u0027Mr Coveney said: \u0027I\u0027m not flexible when it comes to border infrastructure, I never have been.\u0027 Tanaiste Mr Coveney said: \u0027To be honest we don\u0027t take our lead from Boris Johnson in relation to Brexit, we take our lead from the Prime Minister.\u0027She has signed up to very clear commitments, she has written to Donald Tusk (European Council President) confirming those commitments and I believe her by the way, I believe she made those commitments in good faith and I believe she wants to follow through on them.\u0027He said Brexit negotiations would face a \u0027difficult summer\u0027 if the UK Government failed to honour its commitment to agreeing a \u0027backstop\u0027 in the withdrawal treaty.The backstop would mean regulations between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic would continue to align post-Brexit, even if a broader trading deal between the UK and EU failed to materialise.This concept has alarmed unionists, who believe it would end up creating trading barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, undermining the constitutional integrity of the kingdom.Democratic Unionist MP Sammy Wilson, one of Mr Coveney\u0027s most vocal critics, branded him \u0027belligerent, interfering and Brit bashing\u0027 and accused him of trying to break up the UK.The UK cabinet is currently ided on the issue, with detractors of the partnership concept instead advocating new technology and trusted trader schemes to enable smooth trade with the EU.Mr Johnson has been very critical of the idea of a partnership or shared customs territory, insisting it would prevent the UK taking back control of its trading policies.   What are the options on the table for a customs deal with the EU? With time ticking away on the Brexit negotiations, the Cabinet is still at daggers drawn on the shape for future trade relations with the EU.The government has set out two potential options for a customs system after the UK leaves the bloc.But despite a series of tense showdowns at Theresa May\u0027s Brexit \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 ministers continue to be deadlocked over what to do.Meanwhile, Brussels has dismissed both the ideas - and warned that negotiations could stall altogether unless there is progress by a key summit next month.                  Despite a series of tense showdowns at Theresa May\u0027s \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 (pictured in February) ministers continue to be deadlocked over what to doOPTION 1 - CUSTOMS PARTNERSHIP Under the so-called \u0027hybrid model\u0027, the UK would collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels.Britain would be responsible for tracking the origin and final destination of goods coming into the country from outside the EU. The government would also have to ensure all products meet the bloc\u0027s standards.Firms selling directly into the UK market would pay the tariff levels set by Brussels - but would then get a rebate if Britain\u0027s tariffs are lower. Supporters of the hybrid plan in Cabinet - including Theresa May, Philip Hammond and Greg Clark - say keeping duties aligned up front would avoid the need for physical customs borders between the UK and EU.As a result it could solve the thorny issue over creating a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Mrs May has been advised by the chief whip that the hybrid option could be the only way of securing a majority in parliament for a Brexit deal. But Brexiteers regard the proposal as unworkable and cumbersome - and they were joined by Sajid Javid and Gavin Williamson in criticising it at a tense \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 meeting last week.There are fears the experimental system will either collapse and cause chaos, or prevent the UK from being able to negotiate free trade deals around the world after Brexit.Mrs May has instructed official to go away and revise the ideas. Eurosceptics are braced for her to bring back the plan with only \u0027cosmetic\u0027 changes, and try to \u0027peel off\u0027 Mr Javid and Mr Williamson from the core group of Brexiteers.They are also ready for Mrs May to attempt to bypass the \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 altogether and put the issue before the whole Cabinet - where she has more allies. OPTION 2 - MAXIMUM FACILITATIONThe \u0027Max Fac\u0027 option accepts that there will be greater friction at Britain\u0027s borders with the EU. But it would aim to minimise the issues using technology and mutual recognition.Goods could be electronically tracked and pre-cleared by tax authorities on each side.Shipping firms could also be given \u0027trusted trader\u0027 status so they can move goods freely, and only pay tariffs when they are delivered to the destination country.Companies would also be trusted to ensure they were meeting the relevant UK and EU standards on products.Senior ministers such as Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Liam Fox believe this is the only workable option. But Remain minded Tories such as Mr Clark insist it will harm trade and cost jobs in the UK.They also warn that it will require more physical infrastructure on the Irish border - potentially breaching the Good Friday Agreement. It is far from clear whether the government would be able to force anything through parliament that implied a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  The EU has dismissed the idea that \u0027Max Fac\u0027 could prevent checks on the Irish border as \u0027magical thinking\u0027. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/11/1579796F000005DC-0-image-a-2_1526207005085.jpg","title":"Jamie Oliver drops Sunday Times Rich List time debut","story":"    Jamie Oliver has not appeared on The Sunday Times Rich List for the first time since he debuted on it in 2010In January Oliver announced he was closing 12 of his 37 Italian eateries after his food magazine, Jamie, went under last year. The restaurant closures put more than 200 jobs at risk, after creditors pushed through a restructuring plan devised by the chef.Ex-Hilton hotel chef who was on parole for armed robbery is...Share this articleA Company Voluntary Arrangement will allow the Italian chain to secure rent reductions on the remaining estate and exit unprofitable stores.  When he closed six restaurants last year, Oliver blamed a combination of rising Brexit cost pressures and tough trading.

They have been published in newspapers, magazines and on websites around the world.          1.

It will be galling for Harry who, in a BBC documentary last year, hit out at the paparazzi for the way in which they pursued his mother, Princess Diana. She was killed in Paris in 1997 after being chased by photographers.And shortly after his relationship with Meghan became public in 2016, the Prince made a heartfelt plea for the media to respect the privacy of Meghan and her family.Last night, just hours ahead of our exposé, represenatives of Mr Markle wrote to editors around the world and to British newspaper watchdog the Independent Press Standards Organisation.

Jamie Oliver has not appeared on The Sunday Times Rich List for the first time since he debuted on it in 2010BY SEBASTIAN MURPHY-BATES FOR MAILONLINE Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has dropped off the wealth list as his restaurant chain continues to struggle.It is the first time the chef from Essex has been missing from the list since he debuted on it in 2010.His Italian restaurant empire has racked up debts of £71.5million and its staff are owed £2.2million. In January Oliver announced he was closing 12 of his 37 Italian eateries after his food magazine, Jamie, went under last year. The restaurant closures put more than 200 jobs at risk, after creditors pushed through a restructuring plan devised by the chef. A Company Voluntary Arrangement will allow the Italian chain to secure rent reductions on the remaining estate and exit unprofitable stores.  When he closed six restaurants last year, Oliver blamed a combination of rising Brexit cost pressures and tough trading.           The celebrity chef\u0027s restaurant chain has been blighted by problems, which Oliver blamed on BrexitHis chain was stung by the collapse of the pound - which ramped up the cost of buying ingredients from Italy - as well as staff costs and lower footfall. Last month the chef said he could \u0027happily f****** retire\u0027 within the next 12 years as he bemoaned the fact that people blame him for taking away their turkey twizzlers.He told Balance magazine: \u0027I still get “Where’s my Turkey Twizzlers?”.

Such was the effect that Miss Watson needed a moment to compose herself. She was concerned about her horizontal interviewee \u0027transgressing any social rules\u0027, as she demurely put it. But the performance was not yet over. No sooner had she begun the interview than Wilde\u0027s valet burst in with an album that urgently needed the aesthete\u0027s autograph. Oscar waved away the obligation, saying with heavy innuendo: \u0027I am too much engaged just now.\u0027 His intention seemed clear – Oscar the journalist\u0027s prey had become Oscar the hunter.Today, Wilde\u0027s semi-seduction of his interviewer seems as unsubtle as it is peculiar. Could this be the same man who was to become history\u0027s most celebrated gay martyr? Why was he so set on stirring up female desire?The answer lies in his early life when Wilde discovered the effect his seductive charms could have on women – and how he exploited it to his own advantage as he made a name for himself as a writer.Two wives, a poster of Marilyn Monroe on his bathroom door...From a cheeky schoolboy posing next to his sisters, to...Share this articleIndeed, so successful was Wilde the womaniser that he became the object of widespread obsession, driving his female fans half-crazy with desire and enraging fathers and husbands who feared the effect he was having on women\u0027s morals.Never was this Wilde-mania more apparent than on a year-long lecture tour of America, which saw him surrounded by the sort of celebrity hype now reserved for teenage boy bands.The year was 1882, long before the affair with Lord Alfred \u0027Bosie\u0027 Douglas that was to prove his downfall. Back then, Wilde\u0027s sexuality was still in flux, although he had already developed a reputation as something of a ladies\u0027 man.As a student at Oxford University, he had persuaded a young woman to sit on his lap. Her mother entered the room and caught the pair together. Later, she caught Wilde kissing her daughter in the hallway. \u0027Oscar,\u0027 the mother scolded, \u0027the thing was neither right, nor manly, nor gentlemanlike in you.\u0027          Today, Wilde\u0027s semi-seduction of his interviewer seems as unsubtle as it is peculiarThere were plenty more willing to take the girl\u0027s place. Among them were Florence Balcombe, who would go on to marry Dracula author Bram Stoker, and Violet Hunt, an auburn-haired writer who Wilde promised: \u0027We will rule the world, you and I – you with your looks and I with my wits.\u0027In truth, after leaving Oxford in 1878, Wilde struggled to find a niche. \u0027I\u0027ll be a poet, a writer, a dramatist. Somehow or other I\u0027ll be famous, and if not famous, I\u0027ll be notorious,\u0027 he told friends.He set about trying all these careers in turn (and a few more besides) while living on the modest sum of £200 a year after his father\u0027s death. He curried favour among those who might be able to help him, iding his attention between prominent figures in education and art. On one occasion, he offered his services as a personal shopper with an excellent taste in neckties.For all his hustling, he was hardly making a living, let alone making his name. But then came his break: struck by his dandyish demeanour, Punch magazine made him the face of Aestheticism – an artistic movement concerned with poetry and beauty – and from this, Wilde\u0027s reputation began to grow.Soon after, he was offered a US lecture tour by impresario Richard D\u0027Oyly Carte, whose production of Gilbert and Sullivan\u0027s comic opera Patience – which satirised Aestheticism – was touring America. Who better to help promote it than the man who was the very personification of the movement?Wilde\u0027s motives for accepting Carte\u0027s offer were equally mercenary. His first play, Vera, had failed and his finances were stretched. The invitation could not have come at a better time.And so on Christmas Eve 1881, Wilde, then aged 27, wrapped himself in a fur cloak and boarded the SS Arizona at Liverpool.LEGEND has it that on his arrival in the United States in 1882, Wilde breezed through customs by telling officials: \u0027I have nothing to declare but my genius.\u0027There is no firm proof that he uttered those words – the anecdote was first recorded 30 years later –but what is certainly true is that Wilde and his advisers soon discovered that America adored him and that sex sells.Wherever the young, handsome aesthete went, crowds of adoring women would follow. So great were their number in New York that policemen were forced to hold the crowds back so that Wilde could find a path through them. Despite questions over his sexuality from critics – one, with a veiled nod towards his homosexuality, branded Wilde an example of \u0027unmanly manhood\u0027 – female groupies clustered outside his hotels.Word of Wilde\u0027s powers of attraction quickly spread, with lecture halls packed full of women less interested in his quick wit and artistic insights than in gazing at his long raven hair, his elegantly turned legs, the tightness of his trousers and the smoothness of his cheeks.At 6ft 4in and about 14st, he cut an imposing yet elegant figure. And Wilde revelled in the attention. Audiences gossiped about his \u0027mashing\u0027 – late 19th Century American slang for arranging himself in seductive poses and behaving as a womaniser.          And so on Christmas Eve 1881, Wilde, then aged 27, wrapped himself in a fur cloak and boarded the SS Arizona at LiverpoolA thumbnail biographical sketch sold on trains told of how fathers watched in amazement as, before their eyes, their daughters became \u0027love-sick maidens\u0027 who declared Wilde a \u0027perfect raving angel\u0027. Their righteous indignation was whipped up by newspapers, which gleefully reported the worrying effect Wilde\u0027s lectures could have on otherwise-upstanding ladies.Satirists mocked the mood of hysteria. Men swore they\u0027d make him pay for being \u0027the perverter of our wives by means of your idiotic art twaddle\u0027, according to one US newspaper.Naturally, Wilde had little patience for such complaints. \u0027America is the only country in the world where Don Juan is not appreciated,\u0027 he countered, while pronouncing on women\u0027s looks as if conducting his own personal Miss America contest. \u0027I am obliging beautiful young ladies,\u0027 he said, as he signed autographs for his female admirers in front of the man from the Albany Argus newspaper. \u0027I make it a point to grant my autograph to no others.\u0027His unlikely Lothario act sent sales of his literary works soaring. Only a year earlier, English critics had turned up their noses at Wilde\u0027s poems. Now his American admirers were snapping them up.Lines excised from the English edition of his poems for being too risque were included in the US versions, adding to his notoriety. His verses turned nature into an erotic playground.Under Wilde\u0027s influence, a yellow iris offers its throat to a dragonfly\u0027s kisses, trees stoop to peck a swooning nymph, and lilies air-kiss the wind. But it was what he appeared to be confessing about his own love life that fascinated Americans. \u0027I am too young to live without desire,\u0027 one poem declared. Every line fuelled his fans\u0027 fantasies, with composers of popular music doing their utmost to capitalise on the hype with songs dedicated to Wilde-mania.Former journalist Monroe Rosenfeld captured the mood perfectly with a rowdy song called Oscar Dear! that soon became a hit. It was an invented story full of innuendo about a character called Oscar, his wandering hands, and the girl who loved him despite them. It cheerfully encouraged men to find their inner Oscar and to become, as the song put it, \u0027just a little wild\u0027.\u0027Oscar dear, Oscar dear,How flutterly-utterly-flutter you are.Oscar dear, Oscar dear,I think you are awfully wild.\u0027By the time Wilde returned to London in January 1883, his celebrity was assured. An eager public snapped up every morsel of gossip about their idol and swallowed them so quickly that their truth was rarely questioned.          His unlikely Lothario act sent sales of his literary works soaring. Only a year earlier, English critics had turned up their noses at Wilde\u0027s poems. Now his American admirers were snapping them upThis, ironically, plumped up his reputation to such an extent that it gave him the financial means to marry the daughter of a leading barrister a year later.\u0027I am going to be married to a beautiful young girl called Constance Lloyd,\u0027 Oscar told actress and socialite Lillie Langtry. He was as elated as his bride-to-be.He designed her engagement ring himself, forming a heart from pearls and diamonds (his favourite gemstone). He also gave her a pet monkey to keep her company while they were apart.But during the summer of 1891, poet Lionel Johnson dropped in on the Wildes and brought along Lord Alfred Douglas, an angel-faced 21-year-old Oxford student who went by the nickname \u0027Bosie\u0027.Wilde was instantly infatuated. He treated him to tea and then introduced him to Constance.The illicit love story between Oscar and Bosie began that very day – with the shattering consequences that are so well known.When it came in 1895, Oscar\u0027s unmaking was swift and grim. Shamed in court for \u0027the love that dare not speak its name\u0027, he was stripped of his possessions, publicly humiliated, estranged from his wife and two young sons, imprisoned and forced to carry out menial tasks and hard labour for two years.The face of Aestheticism became prisoner C.3.3.Such was his ignominy that after his release he took a new name and lived as Sebastian Melmoth. Oscar Wilde was no more.Long before his death in Paris in 1900, the man who had driven women wild with desire simply ceased to exist. Few dared to stage his plays. His literary reputation was in tatters.The greatest wit of the age had disappeared because society could not accept his sexuality.

Over the coming months, MPs will have the chance to table amendments to Bills – and vote for those amendments – which can prevent the country from suffering the long-term damage that a hard Brexit will cause. Parliamentarians who champion the hardest of Brexits will stubbornly resist any such amendments, and the pro-Brexit press will angrily protest, but what is the role of MPs if not to improve and protect the lives of their constituents? The referendum result did not hand the most ideologically fervent Brexiteers a mandate to take the UK out of the EU on any terms.That is why the three of us are joining forces to appeal to MPs from all parties to take back control of the direction of Brexit. Tomorrow, at the Tilda rice mill in Essex, we will call on Parliament to reject completely the siren calls to sever the UK\u0027s deep economic ties with the European Union. Cheerleaders for a hard Brexit insist it is the only way to forge a buccaneering future for our country as \u0027Global Britain\u0027.The swashbuckling rhetoric may sound exciting but the reality of the choice we face is far harder. For Tilda, an iconic British firm which has been based in the UK for four decades and sells rice in more than 50 countries, the alternatives to Customs Union membership do not guarantee the same level of barrier-free access for its products in the rest of the EU and will require the firm to relocate part of its processing unit.          The swashbuckling rhetoric may sound exciting but the reality of the choice we face is far harderCountless businesses across the UK are similarly troubled by the Government\u0027s failure to come up with a workable way forward. Whether you voted Leave or Remain this is a deeply worrying situation, and one which poses serious economic risks. The Government knows this. Its own analysis concluded that every post-Brexit scenario will come at a cost.Even a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU predicted the UK will see growth drop by 5 per cent over the next 15 years compared with current forecasts, as a result of additional bureaucratic border checks. The ensuing economic pain will be felt in every part of the country. This is not Project Fear it is project reality based on the Government\u0027s own analysis.Nor will any future bilateral deals, which the Government predicts will add just 0.2 to 0.7 per cent to GDP, be easy to secure, with other nations insisting upon their own regulatory and environmental standards, such as the American demand that UK consumers accept chlorine-treated chicken. In this volatile world, in which a protectionist US President threatens trade wars across the planet, is this really the time to go it alone?The truth is that Britain is already proudly, and powerfully, global. Under current arrangements we can trade with European countries but also, as a leading player in an ambitious bloc, with world nations. The EU is already in the process of striking wide-ranging deals with Japan, Canada, Singapore and Mexico, and the negotiating muscle of 27 nations is far more likely to achieve expanded trade with China and India. When it comes to trade, distant nations come into focus through the lens of the EU telescope. A hard, destructive Brexit reverses the telescope: those nations closest to us appear more distant, and those further away fade from view.          They must set aside party loyalties and place their constituents at the forefront of their minds. They must put our country firstOf course, important though the debate about our customs arrangements are, \u0027frictionless\u0027 trade is only possible if the UK is part of the level playing field of regulatory standards and barrier-free supply chains which the Single Market (or similar with the same benefits, as the Brexiteers promised us) provides. If the UK is on the outside then the services sector, which accounts for about 80 per cent of UK economy, will suffer, our global aspirations will be hindered and UK-wide economic harm will follow.A hard Brexit won\u0027t create Global Britain. Instead it is merely a path to a fantasy island where we will have reduced access to our largest markets and a diminished standing in the world. It is not just responsible, economically, to find a better way forward. It is profoundly in the national interest.So when MPs finally vote, at the end of this year, on the Government\u0027s Brexit \u0027deal\u0027, they will be grappling with questions which strike at the heart of our representative democracy and the future of Britain. Does Brexit improve their constituents\u0027 lives? Does the final deal match the promises made in the referendum? Will severing our economic ties with Europe create, or diminish, Global Britain?This will be a judgment which only elected representatives can take. Whatever party they belong to, and however their constituents voted in 2016, MPs must do what they believe is best for the future. They must set aside party loyalties and place their constituents at the forefront of their minds.

The first episodes were so smart and witty.\u0027\u0027I really didn\u0027t want to love it.

branding it \u0027crazy\u0027 and warning it would be a betrayal of the referendum vote.There are claims today that half the full Cabinet roster could also be opposed to the proposal - which would see the UK collect tariffs on behalf of Brussels and then offer businesses rebates.  Mr Coveney appeared to endorse Mrs May\u0027s vision of a partnership in an interview on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show.He said the UK had made a clear commitment in last December\u0027s agreed UK-EU text that there would be no physical infrastructure on the border.Boris Johnson (pictured attending Cabinet last week) launched an extraordinary public attack on Theresa May\u0027s post-Brexit trade plans          Mr Johnson responded to Mrs May\u0027s latest comments about Brexit on Twitter today\u0027That means we are not talking about cameras and scanning systems and drones here - it means we are talking about a political solution that allows for regulatory alignment in a way that prevents the need for border infrastructure,\u0027 he said.\u0027We are simply asking that that commitment be followed through on.\u0027Mr Coveney said: \u0027I\u0027m not flexible when it comes to border infrastructure, I never have been.\u0027 Tanaiste Mr Coveney said: \u0027To be honest we don\u0027t take our lead from Boris Johnson in relation to Brexit, we take our lead from the Prime Minister.\u0027She has signed up to very clear commitments, she has written to Donald Tusk (European Council President) confirming those commitments and I believe her by the way, I believe she made those commitments in good faith and I believe she wants to follow through on them.\u0027He said Brexit negotiations would face a \u0027difficult summer\u0027 if the UK Government failed to honour its commitment to agreeing a \u0027backstop\u0027 in the withdrawal treaty.The backstop would mean regulations between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic would continue to align post-Brexit, even if a broader trading deal between the UK and EU failed to materialise.This concept has alarmed unionists, who believe it would end up creating trading barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, undermining the constitutional integrity of the kingdom.Democratic Unionist MP Sammy Wilson, one of Mr Coveney\u0027s most vocal critics, branded him \u0027belligerent, interfering and Brit bashing\u0027 and accused him of trying to break up the UK.The UK cabinet is currently ided on the issue, with detractors of the partnership concept instead advocating new technology and trusted trader schemes to enable smooth trade with the EU.Mr Johnson has been very critical of the idea of a partnership or shared customs territory, insisting it would prevent the UK taking back control of its trading policies.   What are the options on the table for a customs deal with the EU? With time ticking away on the Brexit negotiations, the Cabinet is still at daggers drawn on the shape for future trade relations with the EU.The government has set out two potential options for a customs system after the UK leaves the bloc.But despite a series of tense showdowns at Theresa May\u0027s Brexit \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 ministers continue to be deadlocked over what to do.Meanwhile, Brussels has dismissed both the ideas - and warned that negotiations could stall altogether unless there is progress by a key summit next month.                  Despite a series of tense showdowns at Theresa May\u0027s \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 (pictured in February) ministers continue to be deadlocked over what to doOPTION 1 - CUSTOMS PARTNERSHIP Under the so-called \u0027hybrid model\u0027, the UK would collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels.Britain would be responsible for tracking the origin and final destination of goods coming into the country from outside the EU. The government would also have to ensure all products meet the bloc\u0027s standards.Firms selling directly into the UK market would pay the tariff levels set by Brussels - but would then get a rebate if Britain\u0027s tariffs are lower. Supporters of the hybrid plan in Cabinet - including Theresa May, Philip Hammond and Greg Clark - say keeping duties aligned up front would avoid the need for physical customs borders between the UK and EU.As a result it could solve the thorny issue over creating a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Mrs May has been advised by the chief whip that the hybrid option could be the only way of securing a majority in parliament for a Brexit deal. But Brexiteers regard the proposal as unworkable and cumbersome - and they were joined by Sajid Javid and Gavin Williamson in criticising it at a tense \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 meeting last week.There are fears the experimental system will either collapse and cause chaos, or prevent the UK from being able to negotiate free trade deals around the world after Brexit.Mrs May has instructed official to go away and revise the ideas. Eurosceptics are braced for her to bring back the plan with only \u0027cosmetic\u0027 changes, and try to \u0027peel off\u0027 Mr Javid and Mr Williamson from the core group of Brexiteers.They are also ready for Mrs May to attempt to bypass the \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 altogether and put the issue before the whole Cabinet - where she has more allies. OPTION 2 - MAXIMUM FACILITATIONThe \u0027Max Fac\u0027 option accepts that there will be greater friction at Britain\u0027s borders with the EU. But it would aim to minimise the issues using technology and mutual recognition.Goods could be electronically tracked and pre-cleared by tax authorities on each side.Shipping firms could also be given \u0027trusted trader\u0027 status so they can move goods freely, and only pay tariffs when they are delivered to the destination country.Companies would also be trusted to ensure they were meeting the relevant UK and EU standards on products.Senior ministers such as Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Liam Fox believe this is the only workable option. But Remain minded Tories such as Mr Clark insist it will harm trade and cost jobs in the UK.They also warn that it will require more physical infrastructure on the Irish border - potentially breaching the Good Friday Agreement. It is far from clear whether the government would be able to force anything through parliament that implied a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  The EU has dismissed the idea that \u0027Max Fac\u0027 could prevent checks on the Irish border as \u0027magical thinking\u0027. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88504833dda69c24bf6c3d4723992c724b3f7c66/0_0_4392_2928/master/4392.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26d4b610ac0c6cdcf6d0ef1632d4a015 1010w","title":"charles dickens science museum medical knowledge","story":"In the opening paragraph of his novel Bleak House, Charles Dickens envisages meeting “a Megalosaurus, forty feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn Hill”. It is a startling image, one that depicts Victorian London as a place of mud, corruption and disease.Prehistoric concerns and scientific interests are not normally connected with this author, who is known best for his depictions of social injustice, eccentric characters and occasional bouts of sentimentality. Indeed, Dickens is generally thought today to have been suspicious of science.But experts believe this reputation in undeserved, and argue that Dickens used scientific imagery throughout his writing. He also believed passionately in the use of science to improve child health, sanitation and human understanding. These themes will be outlined in an exhibition, Charles Dickens: Man of Science, opening this month at the Charles Dickens Museum, at his former home on Doughty Street in London.“For 150 years, it has been thought that Dickens was uninterested in or actually hostile to science,” said Frankie Kubicki, a curator at the museum. “That is a misunderstanding, and a travesty. He was one of the most influential scientific communicators of the Victorian age.”Among the exhibits in the forthcoming exhibition will be the travelling bag that Dickens took on foreign trips. These included a visit to Vesuvius from which he returned “burnt from head to foot”, he later wrote. Also on show will be facsimile notes of Michael Faraday’s public lectures at the Royal Institution, which Dickens subsequently edited and published in his weekly magazine Household Words. His aim with the magazine was to provide a blend of fiction, social campaigning and the science – as described by Faraday in his lectures – behind such everyday matters as making tea, fermenting beer and burning candles.The exhibition will also include a recreation of Pepper’s Ghost, a display of optical illusions created by chemist John Pepper. This used angled glass to create transparent ghostly figures, including some from Dickens’s novella The Haunted Man. By showing how easy it was to deceive the senses, Dickens and Pepper wanted to help reveal the fraudulent claims of spiritualists, who used this kind of equipment at seances at the time.For his part, Dickens was much admired by several scientists, and his associates included the palaeontologist Richard Owen, the mathematician Ada Lovelace (who on her deathbed asked Dickens to read to her from Dombey and Son) and Florence Nightingale, who prescribed his novels to wounded soldiers as a form of “treatment-by-reading”.However, the most intriguing display at the exhibition will be that of a small wax figure of Joe, the “fat boy” from The Pickwick Papers. These wax figures were the 19th-century equivalent of the models of the heroes and villains from Star Wars or Harry Potter films – though they have since earned a special scientific significance that his latter-day equivalents lack, according to the exhibition’s curators. Scientists writing in the American Journal of Medicine in 1956 said the “fat boy” character – who is constantly hungry and prone to falling asleep at every opportunity – defines a particular medical syndrome. Severely overweight iniduals can be prone to breathlessness and daytime sleepiness, and the condition has since been given the name Pickwickian Syndrome.Perhaps the most telling example of Dickens’ scientific writing and his interest in social concerns is found in The Uncommercial Traveller, a collection of sketches and reminiscences. In one of these, the author speculates about the inferences scientists make about extinct creatures from the remains they have left behind – and what future generations would deduce about his society. In particular, he speculated whether or not they would be able to use ancient remains to sense “the existence of the polished state of society that bore with the public savagery of neglected children in the streets and never used its power to seize and save them”.The remark underlines Dickens’s belief that, above all, science should serve society, and explains his commitment to the use of medical knowledge to improve lives. For example, the depictions of sick and dying children in his novels helped change attitudes to childhood disease, and led to his campaigning for the building of the world’s first children’s hospital – a few blocks away from his Doughty Street home – at Great Ormond Street.Charles Dickens: Man of Science runs 24 May to 11 November at London’s Charles Dickens Museum"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff729f7fa869f71d25a3776cb557f88793bbd3f2/170_350_5574_3344/master/5574.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ed261a4062812eb1dc9ad2dbeaa31df","title":"from coal to clean uk does not need to turn to gas says wwf","story":"Report suggests renewables, battery storage and flexible technologies can replace coal plantsThe UK has no need to build new large gas-fired power stations to replace the coal plants that the government has pledged to switch off by 2025, the World Wide Fund for Nature has argued.The gap can instead be filled by renewables, battery storage and flexible technologies, allowing the UK to go from “coal to clean” and skip new gas completely, according to a report by the environmental group.The analysis challenges the orthodoxy that phasing out coal will require large new gas plants.Amber Rudd, when energy secretary in 2015, said: “In the next 10 years, it’s imperative that we get new gas-fired power stations built.”Big energy firms including Drax and Germany’s RWE want to build large-scale gas plants on the sites of former power stations in Yorkshire and Essex, respectively.Almost half of the gas industry’s hopes for new power stations for Europe are slated for the UK but developers have failed to win subsidy contracts through the main route to market, the government’s capacity market.The government is planning to launch a review of the scheme later this year, which renewables proponents fear could tilt the balance.Gareth Redmond-King, the WWF’s head of climate and energy, urged ministers to ensure the review does not open the door to gas.He said: “If we don’t need large-scale gas, if it can’t compete with renewables and there’s no need for it, why would you need a route to market for it?“It is essential the government does not substitute one dirty power source for another.”The last large gas plant to be built in the UK was in Carrington in 2016 – the first since 2012.Using official government forecasts, the WWF found that the growth in electricity produced by wind, solar and other renewables would more than replace the lost power from old coal plants.The government has allocated a £557m pot of funding for more renewables subsidies between now and 2025. That should bring forward the remainder of the new capacity needed as coal drops off the grid.WWF also called on the government to reconsider support for solar power and onshore windfarms, both of which have had subsidies axed. He added that he was encouraged by recent comments from the energy minister, Claire Perry, who has said the government is working “really hard” to allow onshore windfarms to be built with public subsidies in Scotland and Wales but not England.A spokesperson for Drax said: “A reliable power system depends on a range of generation technologies to provide crucial system support services.”Tom Glover, the UK country chair for RWE, said: “The exact amount of gas capacity required is extremely uncertain but the vast majority of forecasts anticipate a significantly higher requirement than suggested in this report.”A BEIS spokesperson said:“We are one of the first countries to commit to end unabated coal power and are leading the world in encouraging other countries to make the same commitment. With clean growth a key pillar of our modern industrial strategy, we are growing our economy while cutting emissions.“With up to £557m of investment in new clean energy projects we have a erse energy mix that is secure, affordable and providing more clean power than ever before.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80c22443ea5ff51f551c813999b84f6a330b7004/0_164_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4629615c862528e3bbb711c17e0afeca","title":"sunday essay kings of wild frontier salmon run alaska","story":"Every year, king salmon swim 2,000 miles up Alaska’s Yukon river to spawn. Their journey is vital to the native people and animals – but now the numbers are dwindling. One man followed their run to find out whyIn 2013, I sat in a courtroom in Bethel, Alaska, and watched the trial of 23 Yup’ik fishermen, accused of flouting a ban on the fishing of king salmon the previous summer. The ban had been implemented by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game as king salmon numbers plummeted, unexpectedly and inexplicably. The fishermen pleaded not guilty. They were justified in fishing, they said, because the taking of king salmon was part of their spiritual practice, their cultural heritage. First amendment. Mike Williams, then chief of the Yup’ik nation, pulled me to one side during a recess. “Gandhi had his salt, we have our salmon,” he said.For the Yup’ik, getting arrested was no accident. They had issued a press release about their intention to fish before setting out. That first day in Bethel the courtroom was full, standing room only. Defendants, supporters, families hefting babies, a handful of journalists and cops. Someone produced a bag of salmon strips and passed it along the benches. Everyone took a piece and chewed on it, including the two state troopers.As I listened to the evidence – the biologists stressing the need for a ban in the wake of the salmon’s collapse, the Alaskan Natives speaking of how the salmons’ spirits would be offended if they did not show up to catch them – I came to see how two different ways of interpreting the world were being forced up against each other.Bethel is the regional hub of the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta, one of the largest deltas in the world: the size of England, with a population of 25,000. It bulges from Alaska’s western coast, a relatively new growth 2,500 years old, from when the Yukon river settled on its current course and began discharging the 90m tonnes of sediment that it transports every year. The Yukon is the longest free-flowing river in North America. It rises in Canada and bisects the state of Alaska east to west. Where it meets the Bering Sea, a little north of Bethel, it stretches seven miles from bank to bank.The Yukon is also the longest salmon run in the world. The king salmon arrive at the river’s mouth from somewhere deep in the Pacific and shoulder their way upriver, against the current, to return to the exact same pools where they were born. They navigate, it is now known, by their sense of smell: they can distinguish a single drop from their home river in 2m gallons of water. From the time they enter the river they will not eat, they will not drink they are fuelled by reserves of oil accumulated during lives spent in the ocean. Kings entering the river’s mouth can be as much as one quarter oil and it is this incredibly high fat content that makes them so highly prized.Those kings that travel furthest reach McNeil Lake, one of the river’s many sources, across the border in Canada’s Yukon territory. They will have swum 1,990 miles upriver and climbed 1,054 metres into the mountains. During their swim, the ovaries of the female hen swell to a sixth of her body weight, the cock’s testes increase fivefold it is what they are wired for now. At the spawning grounds, the females deposit their eggs and the males fertilise them. And then, overcome by the exertion of their journeys, they will all die. It is said that pilgrimages began with nomads returning to the graves of their ancestors: such is the salmon’s return.The eggs lie in the river’s bed through the north’s dark, brutal winter. And in the spring of 2016, that was where I found them, recently hatched, all orphaned. A float plane had left me at the shore of McNeil Lake. It was late May, the ice had just gone out, and I had returned to the Yukon to follow the story of the kings. Since I had left the trial in Bethel, the situation had only worsened. In 2014, a ban on all fishing for king salmon, commercial and subsistence, was enacted along the entire Yukon, Alaskan and Canadian, an unprecedented move. In 2015, that ban was kept in place. In 2016, I decided to canoe the length of the Yukon, at the same time as the salmon run, in an attempt to try to understand what was happening to the kings and how the lives were changing for those who depended on them.Travelling in Scotland in 1724, Daniel Defoe wrote of “salmon in such plenty as is scarce credible”. Early in the 19th century, the fish sold at Billingsgate market in London had been caught a few miles from London Bridge – 3,000 salmon every year. When Lewis and Clark reached America’s west coast in 1805, the annual king salmon run up the Columbia river is thought to have been 15m fish. Across the northern hemisphere, from Japan to Siberia, from Canada to Spain, the return of the salmon was a migration as dramatic as any other on the planet and human lives were shaped by and contingent upon their journeys.A fine levied on Irish tanners washing leather near spawning grounds, imposed in 1466, is perhaps the first piece of anti-pollution legislation in the world. Such conservation measures persisted down the centuries and violations were punished with heavy fines, months in prison, even death. Yet by the 1700s, salmon populations in Europe were wavering. Deforestation was affecting the flow of rivers, removing the many overflows and sloughs that were necessary for their spawning. The waste from breweries, slaughterhouses, distilleries, farms, tanneries and textile mills, against a background of overfishing, hit the runs hard. And then came the Industrial Revolution.Along with its wild salmon population, the Yukon has preserved the ways of life that have evolved alongside the king. I left McNeil Lake at the same time as the young salmon, rushing down through torrents of rapids as the river gushed out from the mountains. Two thousand miles away, the adults in the last months of their lives were entering the Yukon’s mouth, bound for Canada. Somewhere along the way our paths would cross.In every village that I came to I met people mending their nets, repairing their boats, the anticipation palpable. Relatives were returning from the cities to their villages. Elders told me that they had heard the first of the thunder, the salmon tails hitting the water in the distance, saying, “we’re coming! Prepare yourselves!” I saw fishwheels being repaired, great wooden structures that float, revolving on the river’s current, with buckets to scoop out the passing salmon. Facebook posts from the far end of the river showed kings already hanging in the smokehouses.Before the late 19th century, life had not changed significantly along the Yukon for several thousand years. Each year was cyclical, as nomadic families moved through a series of camps, dictated by the rhythm of the seasons, following the resources that they lived by. Every summer, they would camp at prime spots for the kings and spend several weeks catching and smoking the fish to last them through the winter. With the arrival of the goldrushers, and then the missionaries, the natives were driven in a few short years into a series of encampments.The indigenous people the length of the Yukon are now permanently settled, albeit most of their villages hundreds of miles off the road system, and yet the tradition of heading out to make fish camp has remained. It is a time not just for the stocking of larders, but for the swapping of stories, for getting together as a family, for teaching the children how to fish and how to respect the water.The signs of the gold rush are fading now, the log cabins collapsing back into the forest. Coming across a vast paddlesteamer, abandoned on an island and rotting where she stands, feels like stumbling across some ancient Inca temple. There is a sense of time unspooling, drifting in reverse, as the land reasserts its grip. Yet the changes brought by the gold rush to the people, and to the salmon, have made a longer legacy.As the incomers flooded in, canning factories proliferated. Later, the arrival of monofilament nets and outboard motors, along with a cash economy, meant improvements in fishing techniques. There were no regulations and fishermen targeted the largest specimens. Eighty pounders were plentiful the largest king ever caught was 126lbs (57kg), the upper limit of a featherweight boxer. Today, a good fish is 20lbs. Smaller salmon lay fewer eggs: once, five fish used to return for every spawning adult these days, it is more like one to one. That gives very little leeway and makes them far more vulnerable to the other impacts they are now facing: poor management, warming oceans, overfishing, the spread of disease. “The dollar comes before,” one elder explained to me. “The fish didn’t change. We change.”Since the blanket bans of 2014 and 2015, some limited fishing has been permitted, but many people are still choosing not to set a net in an attempt to try to get the run numbers and the size of the fish back up. Some predict that to redress the king’s altered genetics will take eight to 10 cycles of fish, that is to say, at least 50 years other estimates are as long as a century. Humans are the greatest evolutionary force on Earth however long it took to make the changes they created, it will take longer for nature to redress them. For the time being, teenagers who have never been allowed to fish are being taught to prepare salmon with fish from the freezer. The First Nations are being forced into a choice between the preservation of the salmon and the preservation of their culture.I floated further down the Yukon towards Alaska. The sun spun circles in the sky overhead, the endless light of a northern summer. The international border was delineated by a 10ft gap between the spruce trees, a single crenellation in several hundred miles of unbroken forest. Each night, I camped on the river’s shore and each morning I paddled on.Occasionally, I would see a cabin, tucked away up some little creek. It is not only indigenous people who have come to depend on the kings, but those from the outside who have been drawn in by the same frontier mentality as the goldrushers. Many came dodging the draft for Vietnam, in search of a libertarian, self-sufficient lifestyle that was no longer available in the Lower 48. At one time, they fished as a means of eking out a meagre living. Since commercial fishing has been banned, they still rely on salmon to feed both themselves and their sled dogs, although that is getting harder. Many have been forced into finding income elsewhere: along the river, I will stay with no fewer than four men who make a large chunk of their income from appearing on reality TV shows about life in the bush.One day in mid-July, the kings arrive. With their arrival, the fish camps come alive and I spend time helping with the nets, brining salmon strips, talking to generations of families brought together by the occasion. They show me the best ways to prepare the salmon, the best woods to use for smoking it everyone does it differently. We eat the heads and the hearts. But for every fish camp that is populated, I see far more that are abandoned, falling to pieces, their old tarps so sun-faded they are patchwork now. With all the regulations, the strict controls on who can fish and when, many people are choosing not to bother. The price of petrol makes it prohibitive to head out to camp for a few hours here and there. People have jobs to hold down and they cannot justify taking time off to then come back empty-handed.I spend time with elders who still make the journey every year, despite the fact that their children have moved to the cities and there are few fish any more. Their memories of past salmon runs feel inseparable from their other memories and I come to understand that by speaking to people about the salmon, we are speaking of many things. The place that food holds in a culture. The hopes they have for their children and grandchildren. Why they choose to live where they do. What it means to be both a 21st-century American and a Yup’ik drawing on millennia of heritage. How to survive as a hunter-gatherer in a capitalist world.The river snakes back to the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta. Almost half the population is under 18 here. It is the youngest county in the United States. It is the fourth poorest county in the United States and it has the highest unemployment rate of any county: more than a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line. I feel very far from America. In Emmonak, a Yup’ik village, there are 40 jobs for 800 residents outside fishing season and money is increasingly important as the subsistence foods become harder to obtain. There is a growing dependence on food stamps and on welfare. Alcoholism is rife. Suicide is commonplace. I hear similar stories the length of the river, stories of cultures trying to find their way in a new landscape, with changes being forced upon them as the resources they rely on dry up.Within weeks of seeing the first salmon, I am seeing the first dead ones, spawned out, at the end of their runs. They drift into the creeks, the dead and dying, monstrous fish with ragged grey sores, grotesquely humpbacked, bouncing in a daze off the sides of the canoe. I paddle through them, cutting a wake through their bodies. Flaccid and spongy, they are of little use to people any more, but this annual surge of protein benefits more than just the fishermen.An eagle well fed on salmon will have more chicks and will hatch them earlier, giving them more time to fledge before the cold weather comes again. The abandoned carcasses descend the pecking order, feasted on by rodents, by smaller birds and beetles. The insects that pick at the meat left on the bones bring in the songbirds, swallows and amphibians. Kneeling angelica times its flowering for 10 days after the salmon arrive. This is when the blowflies emerge, to lay their eggs in the salmon carcasses. The blowflies need the angelica’s nectar for the energy for reproduction, the angelica needs the blowflies as its pollinator. Their maggots break down the carcasses into the soil. Spruce and willow grow up to three times faster along the streams by spawning grounds.The life of a fish and a river, I have come to see, is astonishingly complex. And however the king is managed in the future, whatever choices are made in prioritising regulation or the rights of people to go out and fish, the approach must be holistic, the many different voices heard.The king is embedded in every level of the ecosystem, an ecology that is connected not just to the animals and plants, but to the politics and culture and to spiritual beliefs. In the north, with the landscape’s bones laid bare, it may be more apparent that nothing exists in isolation, that to alter one element is to have an impact on the whole. But it is no less true for those of us who live in cities, it is only that the webs are more entangled. We are part of the landscape and the salmon’s story is our story.In early September, I reach the sea. It is already deep into autumn and there will be snow now, any day. It is as though the world has run out of ideas and is now simply petering out, a scatter of islands and mudbanks that blur into the water, some grassy flats and a slop of mud and then nothing but the ocean. If there was a place to topple off the end of the Earth this would be it, where the map falls to tatters. Right now, the young salmon will be tumbling from these river mouths, bound for their feeding grounds, untethering from the land and hurling themselves into another world, one that is saline and entirely without boundary. But here I must stop. I can follow only so far.Adam Weymouth’s Kings of the Yukon: An Alaskan River Journey is published by Particular"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76debd1051656b88d119335804ec752b7bbb76ae/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd539d0a4986e498e85e9b7f0dbd48f0","title":"we created poverty algorithms wont make that go away","story":"In the absence of political will to tackle America’s growing economic crisis, hi-tech tools can only serve to automate and amplify existing inequalitiesWe live in a climate of austerity. In the past few months alone, we have seen a federal budget that proposes rolling back support for low-income housing, an executive order attacking welfare programs, and a plan to create a nationwide electronic registry of poor and working-class people. In the context of shrinking support, which families are able to access their basic human needs – housing, food, and healthcare – and which are not? Increasingly it is algorithms – not humans – making that call.Since 2010, I’ve crossed the country studying and writing about the impact of hi-tech tools on public service programs. In Indiana, I investigated an attempt to automate and privatize the state’s welfare eligibility processes. In Los Angeles county, I explored the coordinated entry system, a digital tool intended to match the most vulnerable unhoused people with the most appropriate available resources. And in Allegheny county, Pennsylvania, I studied a statistical model that is supposed to be able to predict which children might be victims of abuse or neglect in the future.In each place I visited, policymakers, data scientists, and social workers told a remarkably consistent story: there is extraordinary need for public programs and not enough help to go around. The goal of automated decision-making, they told me, is to distribute limited resources more equitably, but also to help make the heartbreaking choices of whom among the most exploited and marginalized people in the United States will get help.The result has been an explosion of digital tools for managing poverty – and for alleviating the uncomfortable feeling that we’re not doing enough to address economic suffering. Automated eligibility systems remove discretion from frontline caseworkers and replace welfare offices with online forms and privatized call centers. What seems like an effort to lower program barriers and remove human bias often has the opposite effect, blocking hundreds of thousands of people from receiving the services they deserve. In Indiana, for example, Omega Young of Evansville lost her Medicaid coverage when she failed to attend a telephone recertification appointment. She missed the call because she was in the hospital suffering from terminal cancer.Algorithms act as moral thermometers, sifting survey data to rank unhoused people based on their perceived vulnerability. In the best-case scenario, this ensures that those most in need receive help more quickly. But because low-income housing is scarce, creating a spectrum of “deservingness” often means prioritizing those whose services are most cost-effective. Predictive models use statistics to predict which parents might maltreat their children. But the data that serves as their foundation is only collected on families that use public programs, leading to hi-tech risk detection systems that confuse parenting while poor with poor parenting. In Pittsburgh, the new Allegheny Family Screening Tool weighs 131 different variables available in the department of human services’ public service data warehouse – including whether a family receives Snap, support for depression, or county medical assistance – to decide which calls to the county’s abuse and neglect hotline should be screened in for child welfare investigation.The housing crisis in Los Angeles was not – and is not – random, temporary or inevitable. In the 1950s, opponents blocked a plan to build 10,000 units of integrated low-income housing by reporting the housing authority to the House un-American activities committee. The attempt to shelter poor and working families was lambasted as an act of communism. In the 1960s, the city’s master plan demolished “blighted” neighborhoods without building replacement housing.Homelessness is the product of austere policy. It is caused by inadequate supply of affordable housing, combined with stagnating incomes and a miserly public service system, which devotes far too many resources to erting those in need from the assistance they are legally entitled to.The good news about our collective responsibility for America’s housing crisis is this: if we created this catastrophe, we can fix it. Two simple, but politically challenging, remedies could go a long way towards stemming the growing tide of housing insecurity.First, those of us who own homes could agree to forgo our mortgage interest tax deduction. Sociologist Matthew Desmond points out that as a nation we spent about $41bn in 2016 on housing supports for the needy. Yet we spent more than four times as much – $171bn – on homeowner tax subsidies that primarily benefit families making more than $100,000 a year. Pledging that money instead to creating and stabilizing low-income housing could solve homelessness in a single year.Second, we could lower barriers to receiving social services and increase the payments for TANF, Snap, EITC and other means-tested benefits. Stagnating public benefits levels leave few options when a family faces a health emergency, housing crisis or work interruption. In Los Angeles, general relief payments have been stuck at $221 a month since 1982. In 2015, the Los Angeles Times reported that 13,000 people on public assistance fall into homelessness in the county every month, simply because their benefit levels are not keeping up with the cost of living.In the absence of political will to tackle America’s growing economic crisis, hi-tech tools can only serve to automate and amplify existing inequalities. Yet we are doubling down on austerity instead of facing the root causes of extreme poverty head-on. Austerity fever requires a dedication to cutting the fat from already starving programs. Its systems engineering approaches replace our full panoply of social values – dignity, self-determination, equity, due process – with the twin imperatives of efficiency and cost savings.The triage narrative absolves us of responsibility for our country’s unnatural disasters: the tragedies of malnutrition, homelessness, preventable death and family dissolution, by reinforcing the myth that extreme poverty is simply a fact of life – something to be managed rather than eradicated.As the politics of austerity expands, automated decision-making systems act as empathy overrides, outsourcing inhuman choices about who survives and thrives, and who doesn’t. We empower machines to make these decisions because they are too difficult for us, because we know better. We know that there is no ethical way to prioritize one life over the next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b79d3b0625e6947ba5272ab4a23b91329f1a83ec/98_1959_2674_1603/master/2674.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1196aca3d4f85f4e2e4e3b59fd7246f9 700w","title":"incentive compensation nuclear waste boreholes communities","story":"Compensation offered to encourage local communities to allow test boreholes is described as ‘completely inadequate’MPs from both major parties have attacked the government’s latest incentive to entice communities into volunteering to host Britain’s first deep underground store for nuclear waste as “completely inadequate”.Ministers have offered up to £1m per community for areas that constructively engage in offering to take part in the scheme, and a further sum of up to £2.5m where deep borehole investigations take place.The aim is to find a permanent underground geological disposal facility (GDF) that could store for thousands of years the waste from Britain’s nuclear energy and bomb-making programmes. The scheme could involve building stores under the seabed to house highly radioactive material. It is predicted that the UK is likely to have produced 4.9m tonnes of nuclear waste by 2125.But critics say the inducements offered by the government – part of the consultations it launched this year – to ensure local cooperation are “simply not good enough”, and point to the example of France, which has a similar amount of nuclear waste. It offers around €30m (£26.5m) a year as local support for districts neighbouring the site at Bure, in north-east France, and has also offered €60m in community projects.“The government’s offer in its consultation is simply not good enough. These communities are being asked to perform an important public service and should be properly recompensed,” said Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary.In 2012 the government’s attempt to encourage local areas to host nuclear waste facilities ended in failure when councils in Cumbria and Kent rejected proposals for underground stores to be built within their boundaries. These were the only communities to show significant interest at the time and remain the main candidates for sites now that the government has relaunched its nuclear store programme.The government is seeking to dispose of the UK’s nuclear waste underground because current storage facilities are both ineffective and expensive to maintain. A GDF would involve sealing the waste in rock for as long as it remains a hazard.The plan was also criticised by the Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who said the UK should stop making nuclear waste and stop building new reactors.“We are still pouring untold billions of taxpayer money into propping up an industry that the free market would have killed off years ago,” he said. “In return, we will be compounding the catastrophe of a nuclear waste build-up, which we are no closer to solving than we were when the industry was born.”Nina Schrank, energy campaigner at Greenpeace UK, added: “The lack of seriousness with which the UK government treats nuclear legacy issues makes it predictable that their quest for a suitable site has been so unsuccessful that they are looking again at the Irish Sea, which Sellafield turned into one of the most radioactively contaminated seas in the world.”A government spokesperson said: “The GDF will be a multibillion-pound project that can provide substantial benefits to host communities. This includes skilled employment for hundreds of people for decades to come, spin-off benefits such as infrastructure investment, as well as positive impacts on local service industries that support the facility and its workforce.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1dae440e56e9a5874e703a371a299d38a9d0467/0_95_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ca99340d2a45cc4f5b777473086d348","title":"fishermans friends film comedy james purefoy tuppence midleton cornwall","story":"Cornish singing stars’ remarkable story to be told in new comedy with James Purefoy and Tuppence MiddletonNine years ago a group of Cornish fishermen were singing sea shanties in their village pub when a holidaying music executive came in for a pint. The result was a million-pound record deal and chart-topping success. But the fishermen did not give up the day jobs. Now they are working the boats, singing and coaching actors for a major British comedy based on their remarkable story.Filming has just begun for Fisherman’s Friends in the Cornish village of Port Isaac – and so far a good time is being had by all.Writer-producer Meg Leonard said: “A film community is embracing this fishing community and making them feel a part of it. We’re off now to the pub to meet the fishermen and the cast, and they’ll all have a sing-song together tonight.”The fishermen are working the boats for the film-makers and guiding the actors on Cornish accents and dialects, as well as coaching their singing.The singers – aged from 36 to 68 – include fishermen Jeremy Brown and Jason Nicholas, and former lifeboatman Jon Cleave. They have inspired fictionalised characters played by a British cast that includes Daniel Mays, James Purefoy, David Hayman and Tuppence Middleton.Brown and his son Tom, a sixth-generation fisherman, have been skippering a family boat for the film-makers. Nicholas has been showing them the ropes – literally – warning of the risks in hauling up lobster pots: “In every corner of a boat there is a danger. The pots are in long lines of 40 or 50, all attached to a rope. The weight is horrendous. You’re not going to stand a chance if you’re tangled up in that rope. You’ve always got the risk of being dragged over the side.”Nicholas is happy that the script conveys the hardship of a fisherman’s life. He is usually on the water by 4am, depending on the time of year and the weather, often working until 9pm.Singing, he says, is an integral part of his and his colleagues’ lives: “A lot of singing goes on in the pubs here. All of a sudden, someone will start. Before you know it, everybody’s joined in.” Asked about the fishermen’s success, manager Ian Brown said: “It’s a combination of things. When you see them, you want to be in their gang.” The film will tap into British comedies such as The Full Monty. Co-writer Nick Moorcroft says it “celebrates the power of community”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c092a2de732812879668a65e6dbebd86d38d2c44/0_80_4074_2446/master/4074.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5781fc220f4d92110eeda913192a2a70","title":"premier league 2017 18 fans verdicts arsenal liverpool","story":"Featuring: Le Gaffer’s send-off, Roy Hodgson’s Palace resurrection, a Wagner statue, and Pedro as Harley Quinn• Part 2: Manchester City to West HamHaving papered over the cracks with cup wins in recent seasons, there was no bridging the chasm between first and sixth this time. Grim away showings illustrated Arsène Wenger’s fading motivational capacity. But at least – after the hopes of a fairytale ending were quashed by Diego Simeone – we had a final bit of Wengerball against Burnley, giving Le Gaffer a fitting send-off at the Grove. All in all, though, 510 is about right.Starsflops There were a few tantalising hints that Aubameyang might deliver. Otherwise the only positives were unexpected goals and assists from Monreal and the fresh blood: Reiss Nelson, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Konstantinos Mavropanos. The rest went through the motions, while Hector Bellerín and Alex Iwobi went backwards.Summer targets We need a manager who’ll focus on building from the back. One who’ll hopefully prioritise a world-class, dominant presence between the posts, a replacement for Laurent Koscielny (if we haven’t already found one in Mavropanos – Sven Mislintat’s first discovery?) and a dedicated defensive midfielder whose only ambition is to protect and serve.Best and worst away fans The invasion of 20,000 Cologne fans certainly made an impression. Credit also to Burnley for their chorus of “Only one Arsène Wenger” (after chiding us with “You’re only here for the T-shirts”).Moment that made you smile For all the emotion of Arsène’s leaving do, there was huge relief at having been put out of his and our misery. For the first time in two decades, we’re going in to a summer feeling eager anticipation, without a scooby of what it might bring.It’s been a struggle – it feels like some of this squad may have had their last season here. But while it hasn’t been a comfortable ride, Eddie Howe did well to pull the team out of the bottom three, and there were great wins against Arsenal and Chelsea. One of the club’s biggest problems now, though, is keeping up with fans’ expectations. Just staying up is no longer seen as making progress. 610Starsflops Nathan Aké and Lewis Cook are the two players that really excelled, but Asmir Begovic and Ryan Fraser have had decent seasons, too. As for flops – Jermain Defoe never found his form. Apart for a brief flash against Crystal Palace, he hasn’t looked like he fits in yet with the team.Summer targets There have been lots of rumours about a £12m move for Bristol City striker Bobby Reid – but Howe also has to find some young defenders, even though our own Jack Simpson is ready to step up. In midfield, Chelsea’s Kenedy and Fulham’s Tom Cairney would be on my list.Best and worst away fans The worst were Stoke – they never have anything good to say about any other team, and they really won’t be missed. The best were Liverpool, who do show respect and are keen to talk football.Moment that made you smile Those interview analogies from Carlos Carvalhal were amusing – an improvement on the standard press conference lines. Shame he’s not sticking around.A fantastic season. The brilliant group of players that got us promoted gelled with some superb new signings and they all worked their socks off under Chris Hughton, who must be manager of the year. Securing our Premier League status by beating Manchester United in our last home game was a dream come true. 910Starsflops So many stars … new boys Pascal Gross, Maty Ryan, Davy Pröpper, José Izquierdo and Ezequiel Schelotto. But then our oldies – Bruno, Gaëtan Bong and Glenn Murray – were outstanding, too, as were Lewis Dunk, Shane Duffy and Dale Stephens. Anthony Knockaert, meanwhile, saved it for the last game – he was on fire against United and should take that outstanding display into next season, when hopefully we will see more of Jürgen Locadia.Summer targets We could strengthen, but given the shrewd way the club is run and the success of our under 23s, we have probably got it all covered. And our 22-year-old goalkeeper Christian Walton, on loan at Wigan, won the League One golden glove.Best and worst away fans Everyone loves coming to the Amex. Manchester City fans were the happiest. Crystal Palace were the worst, again.Moment that made you smile We were 2-0 down at Huddersfield, it was snowing, and everyone sang: “If you hate Palace, take off your shoes,” and waved them in the air.It’s been absolutely brilliant – way beyond anything we could have dared hope for. Back in August I was just looking for us to avoid relegation worries, but it went way past that, and now we find ourselves in Europe. Sean Dyche continues to prove himself a tremendous manager for us. His decision in January to sign a new deal was the best news possible. 1010Starsflops It’s always difficult to pick out stars here because it’s all based on team performance. But it would be wrong not to single out Nick Pope and James Tarkowski, who earned deserved England calls. The only possible flops are last summer’s signings Jon Walters and Nahki Wells – but both, particularly Walters, have been held back by injuries.Summer targets I’m sure we’ll have a central defender on the list, and we’ll probably also need another striker. It’s just about adding layers to build up the squad.Best and worst away fans Many have filled the away end and some added to the atmosphere. Manchester United were probably the noisiest. The worst were Swansea – they just didn’t turn up.Moment that made you smile Half-time on the opening day of the season at Chelsea, staring at the big screen showing the scoreline CHELSEA 0 BURNLEY 3. Even then, we couldn’t have known at the time just how good the season was going to be.A frustrating nine months. Relationships have broken down between manager and board, manager and players and, to a degree, manager and fans. Antonio Conte has gone from charming to brooding, stubborn and scowling: it’s all rather familiar. The FA Cup is still up for grabs but, as we know only too well, José Mourinho has a habit of winning cups. Conte sadly doesn’t. 510Starsflops N’Golo Kanté once again shone, and Olivier Giroud made a difference. Eden Hazard has been inconsistent, though we’d be lost without him, while Álvaro Morata is our outstanding flop. Boy did he flop – dramatically, on to his backside mostly. Sometimes, you just know that the fit isn’t right.Summer targets As good as Giroud has been, we still need a striker – possibly even two. Players who have a firm grip on gravity, ideally. We also need some quality to replace Victor Moses (Davide Zappacosta is not the answer), a younger Cesc Fàbregas and some more steel: as a team we are too lightweight. We need players who are happy to mix it up when necessary – John Terry, Didier Drogba, Diego Costa, Michael Ballack, even Frank Lampard were never bullied.Best and worst away fans Roma were loud and energetic, showing how much grounds in this country have been sterilised. Arsenal were like tourists.Moment that made you smile Giroud’s FA Cup goal against Southampton – like an action scene from Platoon, the Saints players falling in his wake as our new favourite hipster took them out. And David Luiz’s fancy‑dress birthday party also guaranteed a snigger or two. Special mention to Pedro for going as Harley Quinn. Fully admire his “go big or go home” attitude.As everyone knows by now, in mid-October we were on zero wins, seven defeats and zero goals. So to be going into the final day with a chance of a top-half finish is just astonishing. And it’s all happened despite the most crippling injury list ever seen at Palace, our only striker forgetting how to score, and a dire transfer window. What a job Roy Hodgson has done. 810Starsflops Wilfried Zaha has been the shining light: we didn’t win a game without him. Luka Milivojevic led by example, James Tomkins was a stalwart, and academy product Aaron Wan-Bissaka made a great start. As for flops: three goals from Christian Benteke all season is simply not acceptable, and surely means his departure. And if anyone knows why we signed Erdal Rakip from Benfica on loan in January, I’d love to hear it.Summer targets We’ve already lined up a very good keeper in Vicente Guaita, who joins in July. But strikers, more than one, are an absolute priority. Another winger wouldn’t go amiss either – someone like Michail Antonio or Ademola Lookman. The dream signing would be to bring in Ruben Loftus-Cheek on a permanent transfer. It’s been a pleasure to see him develop into a player who looks destined to board the plane to Russia.Best and worst away fans Huddersfield sang their hearts out, loving the 3-0 massacring they inflicted on us. But Man City gave their side no backing when they were under the cosh.Moment that made you smile Milivojevic giving Benteke the ball to take a late penalty in April when we were 4-0 up against Leicester. It almost brought a tear to the eye.Back in August there was real optimism. With Ronald Koeman in charge from the start and plenty of new signings in, I was confident we’d consolidate this season, make it into the top six and do well in the Europa League. It didn’t quite work out that way. Two months later we were at the wrong end of the league, embarrassed in Europe, and looking for a new manager. David Unsworth came in as caretaker for a few games before the board picked Sam Allardyce – who is comfortably worse than both of them. 210Starsflops Jordan Pickford has been outstanding in goal, and should, without doubt, be England’s No 1 this summer. New signing Cenk Tosun has done well too, when he’s had some service. Allardyce has to be our top flop – he’s all “me, me, me” and just doesn’t get Everton. Yannick Bolasie, meanwhile, is a circus act.Summer targets Just one: a new manager. Anyone in place of Allardyce.Best and worst away fans The best were Huddersfield, who never stopped singing. Hajduk Split fans were awful.Moment that made you smile Seeing Séamus Coleman return to the side in January after his horrific broken leg. His last-minute sprint when he outpaced two players to get a cross in was wonderful. A marvellous Evertonian.Shutting out the champions then drawing at Stamford Bridge was quite some way to stay up. It’s the latest in a series of remarkable achievements over the last two years from a club that’s always being written off. David Wagner has given us this brilliant ability to come up with the goods when the chips are down. He’s not only the reason we survived, but he is why we’re here in the first place. Get that man a statue! 1010Starsflops Last year’s play-off hero and demigod Christopher Schindler has been an absolute rock at the back and is one of the most underrated players in the Premier League. It didn’t work out for Scott Malone, though. He tore us apart last season when playing for Fulham, but has looked a long, long way off the level we’re at now.Summer targets If we could get Terence Kongolo on a permanent deal it’d be an absolute coup and solve our left-back problem. We also need serious pace up top and on the wings. Steve Mounié and Laurent Depoitre have been great but both are target men, so our play can get one dimensional.Best and worst away fans Liverpool were very disappointing considering their reputation. West Ham enjoyed thrashing us. “We’re West Ham United, we clap with our hands” in reference to our ‘clappers’ made me chuckle.Moment that made you smile Our FA Cup tie against Manchester United when the VAR system produced wobbly lines for an offside decision … Keep VAR out of our beautiful game.On the surface it looks like a relative success, but our league position belies our quality. I predicted that if we abandoned our style we’d struggle, and Claude Puel’s unpopular revolution has proven that to be true. It’s incredible that, given the dirge we’ve endured this season, we’ve been so comfortable in the table. The bottom half must be truly diabolical … I’ll give it 610 for the season 310 for the manager.Starsflops Jamie Vardy was robbed of the official player of the year award, won by Harry Maguire. Without Vardy’s goals who knows where we’d be now. As for flops: he’ll for ever be our greatest ever captain but Wes Morgan has well and truly entered the twilight of his career. Kasper Schmeichel has also seen a remarkable dip in form.Summer targets Recruitment is crucial for us this year, with Riyad Mahrez surely on his way. The unrelenting push for a new brand of football and an ageing squad means we could do with reinforcing every position on the pitch.Best and worst away fans Newcastle were best, but they played us off the park and Sunderland had just gone down, so they had every reason to be chipper. Southampton were disappointing.Moment that made you smile When the visiting Spurs fans were goading Vardy with crude chants about his wife’s appearance on I’m a Celebrity, only for him to rifle home a beautiful volley. It shut them up mid-sentence.We’ve had worse. We didn’t quite make the top spot and we need a point today to guarantee a top-four finish – though of course if we do it right in Kiev that won’t matter. This really is Jürgen Klopp’s team now, with all the rollercoaster rides that brings. He has made us a united force, and he gave City a masterclass in tactics away in the Champions League. After today, Kiev here we come! 910Starsflops No real flops: we’ve improved massively as a unit. Trent Alexander-Arnold has learned fast, Andy Robertson has been phenomenal, Virgil van Dijk looks like he’s played at the back for us for ever and James Milner is revitalised. Sadio Mané is back to his best at just the right time, and I can’t heap high enough praise on Bobby Firmino. Oh, and then there’s Mo Salah.Summer targets I was keen on Roma keeper Alisson until we put seven past him. It’d be great to have another defender on Van Dijk’s level – Toby Alderweireld? And we need more in midfield. Naby Keita is coming but it’d be great if Nice’s Jean Seri joined him.Best and worst away fans The best were all those who don’t whine about our lack of “famous atmosphere”. As ever, usual suspects for worst, but a special mention to Stoke and their fiver-waving antics.Moment that made you smile Hearing the ref’s whistle after what seemed like the hundred and ninety‑eighth minute away to Roma.• Part 2: Manchester City to West Ham"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39bed51595042251ff65e08bd336dd5ff9299f1a/0_129_3861_2317/master/3861.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42a9674b4e72c3490227cf9bc0074c97","title":"fabric swaps hedonism meditation mindfulness nightclub","story":"Fabric, in London’s Clerkenwell, is famous for its vibrating dance floor and late-night partying. But on Tuesday the nightclub will play host to an altogether different mind-bending experience.More than a thousand people are expected to gather at the venue, where pumping beats will by replaced by deafening silence for what is being billed as the biggest group meditation ever held in Britain.Self-styled meditation guru Will Williams is staging the event to launch his new book, The Effortless Mind. The aim, he says, is to attract a new generation to “the inner joys of meditation”.Fabric epitomises the “old hedonism”, he says – a drink-and-drugs-fuelled dance scene from which people traditionally stagger home at dawn. “I want to bring a new hedonism into its space. It’ll be a dynamic, energised night but we’ll all wake up the next morning feeling fantastic,” he says. So it will be mocktails, not cocktails, on the menu.Williams knows only too well the pain of the morning after the night before. A former booking agent for bands and musicians, he used to “indulge in every bit of debauchery you can think of”. But, a decade ago, his life changed after a friend persuaded him to try meditation. At first, he saw it as a means to conquer insomnia and a “brilliant cure for hangovers”. But he was soon hooked and moved to India to study with “the masters” for three years. Experimenting with different types of mindfulness, he kept coming back to vedic meditation. “It doesn’t involve chanting, religion, or uncomfortable sitting positions,” Williams says. “It’s easy, it’s cool, it works.”But he didn’t stop at his own personal enlightenment. Williams calculated that taking the art of ancient eastern meditation and turning it into a thriving western business was the lucrative way forward.He now runs meditation studios in two venues in central London (a three-day course costs around £300) and plans to expand across the country. Williams has no shortage of converts to what he describes as a path to “deeper fulfilment”. One of his newest is Take That’s Howard Donald. After two decades of dismissing “the whole joss-stick-burning thing” that other members of the group embraced, Donald says he now swears by it.“It’s helping me be more creative, but without the drugs,” Donald, who has just turned 50, said. “The thoughts and colours are amazing, the golds, the reds, the blues – I don’t know what they mean, but the visions you get in your mind, they’re beautiful.“The song ideas are flowing even when I’m in the middle of a meditation – sometimes, I just want to cut it short and get the dictaphone out,” he says.“You get emotional sometimes. But that’s good, it’s about letting stuff out, clearing your body, bit by bit.”While grateful that Donald is positive about his experiences, Williams is keen to distance himself from the meditation and celebrity love-in. He worries that it can inspire some, but make others cynical. “We need to show that wisdom, meaning, joy, purpose – it’s about you, me and everyone. We’re all going through the same emotional challenges, whoever we are,” he says.“Meditation is a vehicle, a drug if you like, and a really powerful one.”• To order Effortless Mind by Will Williams for £12.74, go to bookshop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15b3b0c787c7a3bcbed77fce1b2591d1ffadf00b/121_164_2997_1799/master/2997.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5895ceb904372062e2d21ffbc23f6134","title":"joan didion john dunne malibu writers food","story":"In her kitchen at home in Malibu, the writer liked an ice-cold Coke for breakfast – and making salads to feed 40 guestsThis kitchen is in the Malibu house where Didion lived for eight years with her husband John Dunne and daughter Quintana – it stood equidistant from Hollywood (where the two wrote films together) and the San Andreas Fault.Every morning, Dunne would rise, make a fire, give Quintana breakfast, and take her to school. “Then I would get up, have a Coca-Cola, and start work,” Didion remembers, in a recent documentary by her nephew, Griffin Dunne. The Coca-Colas were kept ice cold, and appear as essential to her writing routine as quiet and light. Those who pledged $50 or more to the crowdfunding of Griffin’s film received a copy of her personal cookbook. A scrapbook of food clippings from magazines, menus of the meals she served at dinner parties (for Patti Smith she made chicken hash with roasted yellow peppers and baguettes) and food-stained recipes, handwritten, with terse crossing-outs, its most revealing page was the recipe for a parsley salad, less as an illustration of her diet, or even for the way its sparse style reflects her prose, but more as an insight into her social reach: the salad feeds up to 40.It’s not just that her recipes reveal her – reading her work you see Didion discovers herself this way too. In the notes she scribbled when covering the Patty Hearst trial in 1976 she unpicks her privilege through memories of fancy meals, mid-flight, “Lunching Aloft on Beltsville Roast Turkey with Dressing and Giblet Sauce,” then, “Stuffed Celery au Roquefort over the Rockies”.Though she dwindled to 75 pounds, cooking seems to be for Didion, now 83, one of the rituals that helped her keep on living when everything (John died at the dinner table as she mixed a salad Quintana died two years later, at 39) had shattered around her. After Dunne’s death there was a period when all she ate was congee in the documentary she cuts the crusts off a cucumber sandwich while she reads from The Year of Magical Thinking, her report from the frontline of grief. Translating it into a play, David Hare took the opportunity to plump her up. He set up a table in the theatre, and a sign: Cafe Didion. Here he’d insist she ate, croissants and jam in the morning, sandwiches at lunch.It seems reductive to tie Didion so tightly to death, but it’s there even in her recipe book. From the parsley salad for 40, the quantities shrink as time passes, to 12, to 8, to the cucumber sandwich, for one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47da3cbab1a907411e9760f9fe308799cadd666c/2066_1633_1888_1133/master/1888.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=668b897a16a8717aabbfd07eb548c2ab","title":"mary holbrook goat cheese somerset tymsboro","story":"Mary Holbrook went from a PhD in archeology to becoming the Somerset small farmer who transformed British cheeseThere is a bit of a list of things that get Mary Holbrook’s goat: the government, Brexit, country fields full of solar panels, homogenous executive housing estates, people asking about pioneering cheesemaking and her hallowed place in British dairy history.Holbrook knows about history. She did a PhD in ancient history and archeology and, before cheese became her life, catalogued early scientific instruments in Hamburg in Germany and worked as a curator at a museum in Bath. Her husband, John, was a professor of biochemistry at Bristol University. She was never your typical cheesemaker, but for my money she is Britain’s best.John came from Somerset farming stock, and Sleight Farm, where she has more than 100 goats and 180 British Lop pigs, belonged to his family, but Holbrook was new to it. “I stopped working in museums because of red tape,” she laughs, “but dairy farming is much worse.” It was the mid-70s, she had two goats and two-and-half gallons of milk a day. “I asked myself, what am I going to do with it? Make some cheese. What am I going to do with that? Sell it.”There wasn’t much of a market for English goat’s cheese then so she sold locally through health-food shops. “My really crappy cheese did OK,” she says. “Then I went to France and came across their cheese moulds.”She wasn’t alone. French farmers were going through an artisan cheese revival and their influence was spreading.“They were all women,” says Neal’s Yard Dairy’s Randolph Hodgson, who was driving around the British Isles at the time looking for good cheese to sell. “There was Mary Holbrook at Sleight Farm, Veronica Steele at Milleens and Giana Ferguson at Gubbeen. They were a new wave and new to it. Mary had lived abroad and knew European cheeses and that is what she brought to it. She didn’t like following or leading a crowd. She is an independent spirit.”Also important was “Mr Taylor”, a former cheese buyer at Harrods. Holbrook had met him when she went into the food halls to check out her continental competition. She was soon supplying him. “I used to phone them in spring,” she says. “I’d speak to Mr Taylor and say, ‘I have cheese again.’ They were very good. He accepted it was seasonal. Now everyone wants it all year round. He was getting fresh cheese, the feta, our Little Rydings and Emlett. He took quite a range.”Emlett was my go-to cheese from when Holbrook also farmed sheep, until she suddenly sold her herd and it stopped, along with Sleight Farm’s Little Ryding. “Sheep need quite a lot of looking after, and they need shearing,” she says. “I couldn’t have been away from the farm if I had them.”Since around the time John died in 2002, Holbrook has spent a few days a week in Bethnal Green, east London. One week she’ll bring up cheese to Neal’s Yard Dairy in Bermondsey (“They get what I give them,” she says), the next she delivers her happily raised pigs and kids to restaurants such as Moro and James Lowe’s Lyle’s. Every Wednesday, she looks after her cheese at Neal’s Yard.Currently Holbrook makes four cheeses: young, fresh Sleightlett, Tymsboro, Cardo and Old Ford, a hard goat’s cheese, made when there’s enough milk and she’s inclined.“She is a one-off,” says Martin Gott who worked at Sleight Farm from 2004 to 2006. “What she has forgotten about cheese is more than most people will ever know. But she told me she was packing it up. She was spending a lot of time in London. She didn’t have anyone to milk her goats. It was all over, she said.”Gott and his partner, Nicola Robinson, moved from Cumbria to Somerset. “We shared the farmhouse and rented a couple of rooms. I thought, this lady isn’t going to be around for ever. I didn’t want to lose her take on cheese.”Gott also started developing his St James cheese at Holbrook’s dairy before taking it back to Cumbria. “We were working on the same farm, living in the same house, eating in the same kitchen, going about our own business.”It was the start of a second wind at Sleight Farm. “We were the first of a wave of people who worked with her,” he says. “Maybe she would have packed up, maybe other cheesemakers wouldn’t have come along after us. When you work with Mary, you see what farming should be. She sets the standard. It is a good academy.“She will work as hard as anyone you have ever met. She throws hay bales around. She is incredible. I call those memories my ‘Mary stories’. Like fairy stories they are unbelievable. She sets the bar really high and expects you to meet them. Don’t expect praise, but you know she is happy when she’s humming. Wandering around her farm, she hums quietly to herself. You can see when she is content. And seeing that is enough.”facebooksleightfarmtimsburyTymsboroHolbrook’s ash-coated pyramid. Firm, fresh, near dry white to soft, tangy, greeny-grey.CardoUses cardoon as a vegetable rennet.

I have dated a bit over the years and I’ve tried online dating, but that has never led to anything meaningful. I do have sex sometimes, or spend some time with a man, often it’s even nice, but I can never be relaxed or be myself with men. I am the eldest of three and my parents used to have serious relationship problems. Over several years my dad regularly and loudly threatened to kill himself if my mum left him, he had extreme mood swings, and during these episodes he often confided in me about their sex life. Through sessions with a psychologist, I have come to the realisation that a part of me is still in that room with my dad, being forced to listen to his crying and extremely intimate stories, too shocked to say anything, and those experiences have left me scared of being fully intimate with men, even now. I am trying to figure out what I can do to move on and take better care of my slightly wounded self.Mariella replies I’m so sorry. As you can imagine, I get all kinds of stories in my mailbox and yet there are some that move me more than others. Yours is definitely in that category. The legacy of your father’s self-indulgent and irresponsible behaviour is clear to see and I wish I could feign surprise that it’s embedded itself so deeply in your psyche. Human beings are capable of enormous selfishness, but there’s always the lingering hope that they’ll rein in their excesses for the sake of their children. In your case that certainly wasn’t the case.A friend told me the other day that the coveted fashion label for urban youth, Supreme, has adopted the first line of Philip Larkin’s famous poem This Be the Verse (“They fuck you up your mum and dad”) for their latest collection. It seems to me a slightly obscene marriage of commercialism and poetry, but then again, the line between what it is and isn’t acceptable to appropriate seems to have faded into a faint smudge. You could argue that since a tacky plastic keyring with a logo on it is “cool” once the word “Supreme” is emblazoned on it, Philip Larkin may benefit by becoming the guru to a generation of skateboarders.But beyond the question of taste, what’s clear is that the connection between adult pain and childhood trauma is so well established that it has become the fodder of mainstream marketing campaigns. At the very least it should confirm for you how deeply affected you have been by your father’s appalling emotional self-indulgence. For an adult to so abdicate his responsibilities and dump the weight of his self-pity and sexual dysfunctions on to the shoulders of his child is totally unforgivable, so it feels better to assume he wasn’t in his right mind. You say in your longer letter that your parents are still together and that must make you feel worse, as though you’ve carried the weight of their unhappiness which they dumped on you at a vulnerable age and carried on.You’ve already taken some major steps by seeing a psychologist and recognising where your problems in forming relationships may stem from. Now it’s time to set your sights on the future, and in the absence of rocket fuel, I’d recommend a blast of cold, hard rage to propel you from victimhood to a more sustainable future. In particular you need to keep talking to your psychologist, but along with those hopefully healing sessions it’s time to start simply challenging yourself to interact differently. You need to keep talking to anyone who’ll listen – the point of a date is to see if there’s a connection, after all. Try not to fear vulnerability in proportion it’s what draws people toward us.I’ve no doubt that to date every iota of your emotional intelligence has been employed in keeping you safe from repeating the past in your encounters. Now it’s time to take a step into the unknown and see what transpires when you approach relationships with improved courage. There’s no doubt that we are shaped in youth and shape-shifting in adulthood is achieved with great difficulty. You need to be strong, resolute and prepared to put yourself in the emotional firing line. There will be men like your father out there, but who better than you to spot them and swerve away from that danger?Whatever happens next is your choice and you absolutely can’t change the status quo unless you’re prepared to do things differently. Telling your father how angry you are with him might be part of the cure. He certainly doesn’t need to be protected from such a confrontation and, if anything, it’s long overdue. But if you keep looking backwards it’s so much harder to find a way forward. Meaningful interaction and the possibility of a committed relationship come at the price of dropping your guard and taking opportunities. You know what you desire, you are more than capable of achieving it and you must try not to let the inappropriate and selfish indulgence of a flawed parent prove more than a bad start. I have an unsubstantiated inkling that your time has come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2698df615dc3943754a3360eb0606856e0416bee/0_158_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4aaf67d51e09524a97a95d55b6acd997","title":"sofia helin the bridge happy melancholic","story":"The Bridge actor on dealing with fear, meditating and why marriage is like two treesIt’s a myth that all Scandinavians are happy, healthy, outdoors people.

It remains superb.Its streets are wide and nobly lined with mansions and offices that would flatter a capital. It has rich museums, universities, theatres and 50 dance halls. It has well-kept parks and a graceful river. This is a great city with a character as strong and pleasing as its national drink.But it is also a city that considers itself in trouble. It believes itself to be in the grip of a crime wave, not so much of robbery as of a degenerate, mindless, pointless violence. This week, for example, a 16-year-old boy, who could not run away because he had an artificial leg, was stabbed three times by young strangers in a park. They ran away, shouting “Shamrock”. A 12-year-old boy, the son of a policeman, waiting at a bus stop, was slashed down his jaw-line with a razor. And again there was no reason for an attack that was as casual as a smile at a pretty girl. A girl looking into a shop window with friends was stabbed in the back, apparently because she had refused to kiss a strange young man.The worst of Glasgow’s recent experiences came over the Easter weekend. Then there were 21 serious assaults and 25 robberies with violence. Nearly 100 people were injured. A boy coming home from church on Good Friday was stabbed by a youthful gang and died on the pavement in his father’s arms. There were 132 brutal attacks in Glasgow in March. There were 56 in the same time a year ago.It is a mysterious business and it is not clear if the situation is worse than in other comparable cities. Violence and its punishment was a major issue in the recent local elections and the Tories first and then the Labour candidates made it one of their chief claims to authority. There are demands for sterner punishments and for more powers of search and arrest for the police, though they would seem to have all that a civilised policeman could require.There were famous fights in the 1920s and 30s when gangs of up to 300 fought each other on the streets. Now Lord Carmont, a judge who handed down punishment like an outraged god, is remembered with longing. He is accorded the honour of having diminished razor slashing. The knife has taken its place and the convenient broken bottle remains.Extract from an article, published in the Observer on 19 May 1968, entitled ‘Where the violence is as casual as the smile of a pretty girl’, by Patrick O’Donovan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e51ba3c5e10564116cc1e4e0af3c4f274352bed4/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47d502fbdcaf8bac4819252f20db0d54","title":"embrace the 90s avoid the alexa the dos and donts of festival fashion","story":"Festivals are one of the most testing scenarios your wardrobe can face.

But her festival look is by numbers – in a good way. Moss knows that when you’re out in the wilds, you should stick to the classics: jean cut-offs, sunglasses, wellies and a biker jacket. It may not be the height of innovation but is the best thing when you’re battling an easterly gale and trying to keep the lager in your cardboard cup unharmed. Goals.Alexa Chung is the patron saint of modern festival dressing. She has done it all: PVC trousers, slip dresses and over-the-knee socks, often with a Barbour, usually with a bit of side eye. These are clothes that suit someone walking through the backstage area pretending they don’t notice photographers. They are not the kind of thing to wear when “having a wash” translates to using a couple of wet wipes in your wonky tent.Wings seem to have faded from fashion, but the vestiges of the child’s dressing-up-box remain. Paris Hilton has a lot to answer for: her Coachella look last year involved a rainbow frock and cat ears. And it goes without saying, no Native American headdresses, bindis or anything that can be perceived as cultural appropriation. Not in a festival, not IRL, not anywhere. Not OK.

If you love J Dilla more than your firstborn, this is the festival for you. As previously mentioned, for the first time since its inception in 2007, Field Day won’t be taking place in its spiritual home of HackneyTower Hamlets.

One of the few fests out there to boast a female headliner – step forward the marvellous Ms Badu – there’s an impressive balance between male and female artists, none of which seems like tokenism, but instead about getting the best talent around.

Now grime rules the roost, with Stormzy’s only UK festival set happening here this summer. Wireless also boasts one of the youngest crowds on the festival circuit, and as such the energy levels will likely put to shame anyone over the age of 25.Does it pass the festival Bechdel test?

Pop genius Dua Lipa is the only female solo act to grace the main stage and even though the likes of Sigrid, Nadia Rose, Kate Nash, Hinds and Dream Wife are featured lower down the bill – and the quarter-female Wolf Alice headline the BBC Radio 1 stage – there is still a blind spot when it comes to women being invited to play bigger slots.See also TRMSMT, Isle of Wight, RIZE festivalWho Vampire Weekend, St Vincent, Feist, Josh T Pearson, Oh Sees, Ezra Furman, Omar Souleyman, Julia Holter, Mulatu Astatke, Lucy DacusWhat Small but perfectly formed, End of the Road has its roots in alt-country, but also welcomes indie big-hitters and experimental folkies.

Namely, that after 11 consecutive Reading and Leeds festivals (plus a dozen or so Glastonburys, a handful of T in the Parks, a sprinkling of Indietracks and the occasional depressing event set up in a massive Portuguese car park and most probably headlined by Muse), your memories are likely to be somewhat squiffy. They’re the kind of memories that have been doused in several litres of Lightning Strike cider, left to marinate in a hedge for four days and woken up with ill-advised tribal facepaint. And, like the bearded man in the healing fields who claims he can levitate through the 17th dimension, they’re probably not to be trusted. So when I check my own festival memories I have to wonder if many of them actually happened. Did I really see a baby in a buggy crowdsurfing through a packed field? Can it be true that I carried one of my friends across a mud-plagued Glastonbury site while he told passing strangers that he was the supreme ruler of the universe, only to then watch him pass out in a toilet block and urinate on himself? Was the night I spent inhaling toxic plastic fumes as tents and toilet blocks were set ablaze around me a figment of my imagination, a fever dream brought on after eating an undercooked chicken pad thai?Whether it’s watching Kevin Rowland confuse an entire crowd by wearing white stockings and suspenders or witnessing Michael Eavis redefine the very definition of the term “singing” while onstage with Stevie Wonder, the thing about festival memories is that they often take on a strange, hallucinatory air. Sure, you buy your ticket to watch Oasis or Beyoncé or Skepta – but then you come back telling friends that actually you went to see six shows by a fully grown man pretending to be a lobster while singing Christmas songs instead.That is the whole glorious point. The best festivals should exist at the point where reality and surreality meet, and your mind is no longer completely sure what’s happening. There should be giant spiders spouting fire, DJ sets that involve you climbing onstage to dance in your wellies, and deep and meaningful conversations about life, the universe and where you put your last piece of chewing gum.You’re left with a muddy mountain of experiences, many of which are hard to verify and almost all of which have no application once back in the real world. It’s unlikely that many potential employers out there are going to be impressed by your ability to fashion semi-waterproof shoes out of two Sainsbury’s bags and a lanyard. Remembering where your tent is located at 5am after several hours in the rave fields might be a game-changer at the time but it doesn’t really translate to anything particularly useful in the office environment. But that’s not important. What’s important at a festival is that you had the best possible time – and that’s especially likely to be the case if you can barely remember any of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f03e374785f6be42520b724d2bf8f5527d446cae/0_490_3942_2365/master/3942.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd18e1fefa7d4836dcf846365a34acc","title":"mnek i snogged my ex but i havent gone as far as ho ing at a festival","story":"The singer-songwriter shares his festival thoughts on Noel Gallagher’s questionable opinions on rap and height-related tent woes If you dropped your phone down a festival toilet, would you attempt to retrieve it?Abso-fucking-lutely.

In a world that has embraced the gig economy, she has enthusiastically turned her hand to pretty much anything, anywhere. There have been bipartisan judging stints on The Voice and The X Factor. She was selected to spearhead the reboot of America’s Next Top Model. And in the Fifty Shades film franchise, she had a recurring role as kink magnate Christian Grey’s sister, Mia. The reward has been enviable visibility and sustained popularity.Even if her unnamed second album seems to be perpetually pushed back (recent reports suggest it will arrive in autumn an appropriate title might be Zeno’s Paradox), Ora’s fast and furious work ethic is undeniable. She recently killed it on the Met Gala red carpet, but you could plausibly imagine a Deliveroo moped parked up in the background. This impressive juggling act of income streams has included a steady drip-drip of monster singles, and the guaranteed success of Ora’s smoochy new hit Girls will see her elbow past Shirley Bassey and Petula Clark to claim the record for the most Top 10 singles by a UK solo female artist. Like Kylie Minogue, she is a pop star who makes hard graft seem effortlessly glam.On the first night of a sold-out UK road trip to relatively intimate venues – her first proper tour in three years – Ora scales things back while still gleefully over-delivering. There was presumably no pressing need to take to the stage in the swaggering, soft-butch silhouette of a Dick Tracy trench coat stitched together from three different tartans, but in Glasgow she does it anyway. “Who’s ready to party and bullshit with me right now?” she yells, introducing How We Do, her pleasingly laid-back hedonistic hymn. The audience, which includes a considerable number of mums and young daughters, clearly adore her, singing along to every word of Poison, one of the greatest yet most agitated love declarations of modern times.Within four songs, Ora has ditched her big mac to reveal a dazzlingly diamante-studded yellow tartan two-piece. For the slow jam Body on Me, she also dismisses her four dancers to create some impressively Tina Turner-esque drama using only a mic stand, a flapping chiffon cloak and a wind machine on full-blast. Her standout new track Soul Survivor is an unvarnished account of being signed by Jay-Z and his label Roc Nation, a fractious relationship that deteriorated into a court battle. A no-holds-barred lyric video with conspicuous footage of a dove flying free emphatically make Ora’s case for emancipation.With her second album seemingly in stasis, Ora delivers a smartly tailored set that barrels forward with infectious vigour. With only a handful of new songs, it feels like a celebratory consolidation rather than a vaunting reimagining. A particular highlight is Girls: she plucks four fans from the crowd to jive with her on stage, which seems like a moment of genuine impromptu connection rather than a stage-managed meet’n’greet. She closes with the lost-soul anthem Anywhere, and while the “over the hills and far away” chorus invokes memories of nursery rhymes, it feels more like a fairytale ending.• At Academy, Newcastle, on 13 May.

However, the environment secretary also expressed scepticism about the merits of an alternative customs proposal, saying the customs partnership model had flaws and needed to be tested.Theresa May has split members of her warring cabinet into two working groups to thrash out the merits of her two customs proposals. Under the prime minister’s favoured customs partnership model, the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU and it would go some way to solving the issue with the Northern Irish border. However, it has been denounced by Brexiters who say it is untested and would force Britain into copying the EU’s product standards and regulations. They prefer the “maximum facilitation” model that relies on technology to minimise border checks, which critics say cannot resolve the Irish border issue and would require lengthy development of sophisticated new technology.“The critical thing is to meet that deadline. My experience in government reinforces my belief that we need to make sure we deliver things at pace,” Gove said.He told Marr he had qualms about the customs partnership model, defending Boris Johnson, who described the plan as crazy in an interview earlier this week. Speaking on the same programme, Ireland’s tánaiste and foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said there had been a clear commitment from May that there would be no border infrastructure. He said any backtracking would mean “a very difficult summer for these negotiations if that happens”.Coveney said: “If we are expecting to get this concluded by the end of October, is it unreasonable for the Irish government to ask for significant progress on a hugely important issue by the end of June, when it is actually factored into the EU negotiating guidelines that there would be a reassessment by the end of June?” He said the Irish government was seeking a political solution that allowed for regulatory alignment in a way that prevented a need for border infrastructure.On Sunday, May attempted to calm tensions with a Facebook article setting out three tests that a new customs arrangement would need to meet. She said no hard border in Northern Ireland, nor a border at the Irish Sea, were acceptable, and that any deal must “protect our precious union and honour the agreements that were reached in the historic Northern Irish peace process”.The prime minister said agreements must create as little friction as possible for trade – an acknowledgment that some new obstacles may be created. The agreement also must not constrain Britain’s ability to negotiate trade agreements with other countries around the world, May said, comparing it to Labour’s policy of forging a new customs union with the European Union.May said she wanted to restate her case “amid all the noisy debate and technical discussions”. Johnson has been excluded from the two working groups examining the merits of both options, as has the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who is most in favour of the customs partnership.Gove will examine the customs partnership alongside Liam Fox and David Lidington, while David Davis will examine the “max fac” model with Karen Bradley and Greg Clark, who have expressed scepticism about that model’s negative effects on business and on its workability at the Northern Irish border.Though the majority of cabinet ministers in the working groups have been tasked with examining their least-preferred options, sources earlier this week suggested most ministers’ positions had become more entrenched.Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, called the rift “a farcical situation”.“Nearly two years after the referendum the cabinet is fighting over two customs options – neither of which frankly are workable, neither of which are acceptable to the EU.”He said Labour proposed a combination of a comprehensive customs union and a close relationship with the EU single market. “Nobody credible suggests you can achieve no hard border without it,” he told Marr.

There are some wonderful plots but the books are kind of clunky. With Hayao Miyazaki, who I discovered as a parent, there’s none of that clunkiness. He makes films that both young kids and decrepit adults like myself can absorb at pretty well the same level. He thinks very deeply, and quite pessimistically, about history, politics and environmental issues. As someone who works on the Anthropocene concept – holding that people are changing the geology of the Earth, with uncomfortable consequences for future generations – I find his work very compelling.Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind is set in a postapocalyptic landscape, with acid oceans and poisonous forests inhabited by huge, threatening-looking insects. Nausicaä belongs to one of the smaller human communities fighting it out over the remains. She strives to protect the giant insects, which in any other film would be the monsters, and is trying to do some ecological restitution on the poisonous forests. She understands the insects as part of the ecosystem rather than an aberration.It seems to me that Miyazaki is one of the few contemporary popular artists whose work is adequate to the reality of the Anthropocene, and to its human consequences. He faces the predicament full on, yet he realises that people have to live through it. Life goes on. You do what you can in the circumstances. We have no option but to live in this damaged world and do our best.Neuroscientist and adjunct professor at Stanford UniversityWestworld(TV series, 2016-)One of the big questions of neuroscience is: can we understand the principles of intelligence so that\u0026nbspwe can replicate them on a different substrate? A related question is: could we build consciousness on a computational substrate? The answer to this is not known but it seems likely that we could, given that mother nature used a hundred billion cells to build\u0026nbspour conscious brains.These questions are at the heart of the TV show Westworld, to which I’ve contributed as a scientific adviser. It takes place in a near future where we can build androids that are indistinguishable from humans in terms of how they look, feel, talk and act. A company launches an entertainment venue recreating the old west where you can shoot these androids, sleep with them in a brothel, go on adventures with them. The plot turns on some of these androids starting to develop self-awareness and remembering things from their previous incarnations, which leads to trouble for the humans.The idea that robots could gain consciousness is an idea that we can’t rule in or out right now, but it certainly seems plausible. There are so many directions that AI might go in. It’s much easier to build software and not have to deal with all the physical stuff. But whether we want, and can create, AI that is like a human is yet to be seen.My colleagues and I have been writing about these issues for decades, but when you wrap an idea in fiction it attracts a much larger audience. I think Westworld is doing a terrific job of bringing these issues into the public consciousness.Professor of physics and astronomy, University College\u0026nbspLondonInterstellar (Christopher Nolan, 2014)What I loved about Interstellar was its representation of exosolar planets – planets outside our solar system that orbit a star. I have a team at UCL which explores the nature of these planets, typically tens\u0026nbspor hundreds of light years from Earth.\u0026nbspWe started out looking for planets similar to ours, but in the journey we’ve discovered such a ersity of planets out there, and\u0026nbspthey are so exotic, that I think my own interests, at least, have shifted a bit.The planets they were travelling to in Interstellar seemed to me very accurate, based on the information we have. The first one that Matthew McConaughey’s character visits after leaving Earth is a water world, where a gigantic tidal wave is heading towards them. We believe that similar sorts of planets must exist – and the same with the icy world, which they visit later in the movie. We know that there are many rocky planets very far from their star, so presumably this is a realistic representation of what they might look like. I also thought the description of the scenario on Earth, if we keep going with climate change, was, unfortunately, very realistic.In a certain sense it helps to see what these planets might look like: when I think of water worlds now, all of a sudden I have this image from the film. And sometimes I use\u0026nbsppictures from Interstellar when I’m doing a public science talk. Rather than describing the density\u0026nbspof the planet or what it might look like, you just show an image and everyone connects with what you want to say. It’s very\u0026nbsppowerful.Astronomer royal and emeritus professor of cosmology and astrophysics, University of Cambridge Last and First Men Star Maker Olaf Stapledon (19301937)I’m not a great reader of science fiction but I am a fan of the books of\u0026nbspOlaf Stapledon.

At the time I saw them as entertainment, but thinking back on them now they seem quite far-sighted.His 1930s books Last and First Men and Star Maker are full of fascinating ideas. Last and First Men is really a history of the future covering 2bn years and following 18 distinct species of human, the first of which is our own. Over time they leave Earth and spread towards the outer planets. One species are giant brains without much of a body. The idea of a disembodied brain that can create new species – they design the type of human that comes after them – is\u0026nbspvery imaginative. We’re talking about similar ideas today.Star Maker is even broader in its scope. The narrator starts on the Earth, goes out into space and gradually merges with the intelligences in other places. Then he meets the star maker who, it turns out, has made lots of universes besides our own, some of which work better than others. One universe is an interesting precursor to the Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics, which says that whenever there’s a quantum uncertainty, both options are taken\u0026nbspand the universe ides. Another universe has no spatial dimensions at all but just time – Stapledon calls it a musical universe.\u0026nbspThese ideas, especially given that these were written in the\u0026nbsp1930s, are manifestations of a\u0026nbspvery original mind.The Martian begins with an astronaut – played by Matt Damon – getting stranded on Mars after a dust storm forces his fellow astronauts to leave. It deals with two main challenges: first, how Damon’s character will survive alone in this very difficult environment – how he’s going to provide food and power for himself – and second, how the space\u0026nbspscientists back on Earth are going to get him home.My own work focuses on genome editing: I’ve been working on technology, known as Crispr, for altering the DNA sequences in cells in a precise fashion. Since 2012, when we first published our work on Crispr, it’s been adopted worldwide for altering the DNA sequences in human cells but also various types of animals and plants.When I look at The Martian – and this actually sparked a lot of conversation in my own lab after the film came out – I think about how genome editing might be useful in human space travel to Mars. For example, the character played by Matt Damon grows potatoes to survive. If gene editing were available, you could potentially\u0026nbspmake some changes to the potatoes so they would require less water, or in different ways be more suited to that environment.We have a lot of issues here on our home planet, and rather than spending our treasures on sending a couple of people to Mars, I’d like to see us addressing challenges that we have on Earth. That being said, ours is a species that likes to explore we’re adventurers, and if we were to make a trip to a planet like Mars, I think a lot of interesting technologies and ideas would come from that, which might actually benefit our own planet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ec6bcbd5df2b1fe435c2dc256e2964228e4c8d1/0_0_3418_2052/master/3418.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ba94a8d79904cef8cebd8024b10cfb5","title":"one in five  turned down for universal credit rules too complex","story":"Fears are emerging over the complexity of the government’s new welfare system after data revealed that one in five applicants is being turned down because they are failing to comply with the application process.Ministers have already been forced to slow down the rollout of universal credit and to ensure that claimants receive their payments sooner after concerns that some were waiting well over a month for funds and were facing mounting rent arrears. Some welfare campaigners now fear that the complexity of the application system has left thousands of applicants falling foul of the rules.According to data released under the Freedom of Information Act, which analysed applications for universal credit over one month, a fifth were turned down because of “non-compliance with the process”. Of those, half failed to book an initial interview. The rules state that if the applicant has not called a helpline to set up an interview within a week of making their application, their claim may be closed.With around 100,000 new claims for universal credit each month, this could mean that tens of thousands of people will not receive a payment.A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said the figures “don’t capture the reasons” for people not completing their application. “It may be they’ve found higher-paying employment and no longer need support,” he said. “Almost 800,000 people have already applied for universal credit successfully, and anyone struggling with the process can call the helpline or visit their local jobcentre, where staff will help them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4e173b786395abd969127e204a2b932f092d2eb/0_433_3642_2185/master/3642.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a73efdd4689c51d461307acdc09157a8","title":"leinster racing 92 hats off beret brigade boot","story":"Racing’s players ran on to the pitch wearing berets, a nod to the host city that is regarded as the capital of the Basque region. They did the same 31 years ago when playing a Top 14 match in Bayonne, a period when some of the club’s players formed the Eden Park leisure clothing brand. When they faced Brive in April 1987, they took to the field in blazers and pink bow ties, and they sported harem pants the following week against Toulouse.They were known then as the showbiz kids but a cup final comes under the factual rather than entertainment category. With heavy rain falling, Dan Carter withdrawing from the bench on Friday with a hamstring strain and the player he was understudying, Pat Lambie, lasting two minutes before he suffered a knee injury, black seemed the appropriate colour for Racing. It was so only at the end, having matched Leinster for every stride.There had been a clue about Carter’s fitness on Wednesday when he pulled out of a conference call with journalists just before it was due to start. Racing were already without their captain and spiritual guide, Maxime Machenaud, who suffered a knee injury in the penultimate round of the Top 14. His replacement at scrum-half and as the side’s leading goal-kicker was Teddy Iribaren, a journeyman No\u0026nbsp9, who, at the age of 27, had spent most of his career in the shadows.He did not need dark glasses to shield his eyes from the limelight. A focus in the week had been the likely influence of the fly-halves, Johnny Sexton for Leinster, the South African international Lambie and Carter for Racing, but with the wet ball making handling hazardous, the scrum-halves became the focal point. The three used handled the ball 207 times, their fly-halves 57. Iribaren, left-footed, put distance on his box kicks while Luke McGrath weighted his more, conscious of the discomfort of two of Racing’s back\u0026nbspthree, Louis Dupichot and Marc Andreu, that prompted them to drop too deep.Wales was once said to have had a fly-half factory but scrum-halves come off they production line in France, virtually cloned. They tend to be small and wiry and lead tactically. So, although Racing had their second choice in the position, partnered for most of the match by the third option at 10, Rémi Talès, a 34-year-old with 24 France caps, the conditions had more impact on their pattern of play than injuries. The best defence in the competition held but discipline did not.Leinster, who equalled Toulouse’s record of four European Cup triumphs, had swept all before them in Europe but Racing were prepared. They used Iribaren to play for position, their big ball-carriers taking out defenders to give the scrum-half the time to kick, and Leinster initially struggled to force\u0026nbspturnovers.Leinster’s journey to Bilbao had seen them recycle ball at will but here they struggled after taking the ball into the breakdown where the Racing hooker, Camille Chat, was the main saboteur.It made for a cagey affair that from the start was a battle of the boot. French teams are known for a tendency to flag in the final quarter. Leinster did not lead in the first 77 minutes but Racing, who have played in two finals in the past three years without scoring a try, were never more than three points ahead.There was a sense Leinster were waiting for the closing moments but Racing were like a rash no salve could sooth. What did for them ultimately was a lack of variation: they kept kicking but Leinster’s back three was secure and as the rain relented they exploited the greater scope for continuity. As Iribaren tired, there was no trusted\u0026nbspreplacement.It looked destined for extra time, unless Sexton could equal his feat at the start of the Six Nations when he dropped a goal with time up to secure victory for Ireland in Paris, but in a match addled with penalties, there was an inevitability about one team having a final\u0026nbspchance.It was Racing who cracked, Talès marginally straying offside under his own posts for Isa Nacewa to put Leinster ahead after Racing had been penalised in attack and had wasted a lineout steal. They had a final fling but Talès is no Sexton and hooked his drop goal. From berets to buried."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d072563e62b66e156f81dbc5318a61cc2e585806/30_20_3060_1836/master/3060.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07b08c151a925f7191a93b938f4abca3","title":"county cricket surrey v yorkshire nottinghamshire v lancashire and more live","story":"It’s been a romp for Somerset in an elongated session. Hildreth and Dom Bess, an imposter at No 10, added 145 together as the pitch ran out of malice and the Hampshire bowlers – with the exception of Fidel Edwards who kept steaming in to no great effect – ran out of puff. At lunch Somerset sit pretty on 472-9, a lead of 241.Hildreth has been the more measured of the two. He knows how to capitalise. This was the 15th time he had passed 150 out of his 43 hundreds. Then in the last over before lunch on 184 he mishit a high full toss from Tom Alsop, a very occasional left-armer, to mid-on. How fortunate for Somerset that they are unlikely to be deprived of Hildreth’s services once the Tests start, how unjust that he has never played a match for England, though he represented the Lions on a regular basis a few years ago. His self-deprecating manner may not have endeared him to the men that matter, I suppose.We know the powers that be like the buzz and business of Bess, who will surely not bat in double figures again for Somerset. He has a first class hundred to his name for the MCC against Essex in Barbados in March. At lunch he was unbeaten on 84 and he may have the chance top register his first one for Somerset after the break.With the sun out the demons seem to have departed so we expect plenty from Bess and Leach with the ball before long.Yorkshire have lost two more quickly, Jack Leaning for 20 lbw to Rikki Clarke and Tim Bresnan caught at second slip off Sam Curran for one, to slip to 158-7, still 107 runs away from the follow-on target. Curran has five wickets, and Jonny Bairstow is still there on 76. Warwickshire are 21-1 chasing 179 against Northamptonshire, while Kent have lost three morning wickets and are 198-7 against Sussex at Canterbury, leading by 232. Glamorgan are turning things around at Grace Road and have taken five this morning, with Leicestershire 158-7 and leading by 171. Michael Hogan has four-for. Here, Jonny ploughs on, although helped by a missed opportunity from Jade Dernbach (one-handed to his right) off his own bowling on 66. He has 74 of 154-5. Yorkshire need to reach 265 to avoid the follow-on.Jonny Bairstow reaches 50 off 46 balls with 10 fours, his second successive fifty after last week’s effort against the new ball in the second innings at Chelmsford. Is he England’s best batsman right now? Anyway, Yorkshire are 131-5. And Lancashire have won by an innings and 67 at Trent Bridge, bowling Notts out for 138 in their second innings. 6-55 for Onions and 4-26 for Anderson. That is Lancashire’s first away win in the Championship since July 2015 against Glamorgan at Colwyn Bay when Ashwell Prince and Alviro Petersen put on 501 for the fourth wicket - also an innings win.Lancashire are on the verge of their first win, with Nottinghamshire having lost three morning wickets to slip to 127-8. They are still 78 runs in arrears, with Graham Onions completing a five-for. He has shared all eight to fall with new ball partner Jimmy Anderson, who has most recently trapped Luke Fletcher lbw for nought.Greetings from Taunton, where Somerset are attacking the second new ball – there haven’t been many of those unwrapped here this season. Jack Leach lost his off stump to the old ball, not playing a shot. Obviously he was trying to play too responsibly. Against the new one the runs have flowed. Hildreth purrs on and Dom Bess is not really a number ten. In fact the names of Somerset’s batsmen from 7-10 (mind you Groenewald at 11 is not so bad) could be put into a hat to sort out the order. Just enjoyed a magnificent slice of coffee and walnut cake produced, if not cooked, by our press box doyen and host, Richard Walsh. What a fine start to the day.I mentioned in the scene-setter that Doug Bracewell had to back up his first-innings 81 to give Northamptonshire a realistic chance of victory over Warwickshire at Edgbaston. Well, he’s gone for seven, caught behind off Olly Stone. Northants are 1798, leading by 170. Here, Yorkshire are five down having lost Harry Brook, caught behind off Sam Curran for 17. They are 865, and Jonny Bairstow has 33 of them in typically pugnacious fashion.Joe Root has gone to the day’s sixth ball from Sam Curran. He’s been trapped lbw playing around his front pad for 14 having faced the second half of the over. Jonny Bairstow joins Harry Brook at the crease, and Yorkshire are 414. Saturday was a day for two centurions who are very much in the category of England hopefuls Keaton Jennings for Lancashire against Nottinghamshire and Joe Clarke for Worcestershire against Essex. On Sunday, the current Test captain will hope to match them as Yorkshire bid to stave off a Surrey charge towards victory here.Joe Root will begin day three unbeaten on 14 with his side at 403 in reply to Surrey’s 414. Jonny Bairstow is still to come as well, and the White Rose will need them both to perform. The general consensus is that this is a new ball pitch, so the first hour or so will be very interesting.Both Jennings and Clarke, Lions team-mates, scored their second successive centuries. Jennings helped put Lancashire in control at Trent Bridge, with Notts 1065 in their second innings and still 99 runs behind. That one could easily be done by lunch. It would not be a great surprise to see the left-hander named in Ed Smith’s first Test squad later this week. Clarke’s inclusion, surely ahead of James Vince if anything, would be a touch more left field. But why not?His Worcester side just about have the edge against Essex, who will resume day three on 1434 in their second innings with a lead of 82. Alastair Cook was out for 66 late on last night.James Hildreth will resume unbeaten on 125 for Somerset (3247) against Hampshire (231) at Taunton. England chance passed him by? Probably, yes, although many will put him in the unlucky bracket.In Division Two, like here at the Oval where rain damaged day two, they will get under way at Lord’s between Middlesex and Gloucestershire. The hosts declared on 4558 before rain arrived at lunch. Leicestershire (191 and 1192) are on top against Glamorgan (178) at Grace Road with a lead of 132, as are Kent (215 and 1254) against Sussex (181) at Canterbury. They lead by 159. The draw looks favourite between Derbyshire (427) and Durham (1152) at the County Ground.And finally, Division Two pacesetters Warwickshire are on course to win again, with Northamptonshire struggling at Edgbaston. They are 1607 in their second innings with a lead of 151. New Zealand all-rounder Doug Bracewell is at the crease. If he can match his first-innings 81, they could be in business.

The world champion has been coy on his future recently, leading to speculation that he will leave the sport to pursue music and fashion interests, but would he really throw in the towel just yet?It’s not warm in Catalonia for today’s race, about 15 degrees at present, and that may favour the Mercedes of Hamilton and Bottas. Toto Wolff joked yesterday that Mercedes were trying to fix the weather to make it “arctic”. Rain is forecast though, so that could throw a ner in the works. Wolff has just spoken trackside to say he thinks most teams will make two pit stops in the race. The head of Formula One’s governing body has responded to criticism from drivers about rule changes by saying they had every opportunity to contribute but often failed to attend meetings. The FIA president, Jean Todt, hit back after Hamilton and Vettel said new aerodynamic regulations for 2019 that would slow the cars by around 1.5 seconds a lap had come as a surprise. “I do respect them and know how busy they can be and all that. But they have access,” said Todt. “Unfortunately very often there is a meeting and they don’t come to the meeting. I have always tried to hear what the drivers were saying. The drivers are invited to participate, to do something.” Todt pointed out also that he had appointed a number of former racers to FIA commissions. Four-times world champions Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel had said on Saturday that new aerodynamic regulations for 2019 that would slow the cars by around 1.5 seconds a lap had come as a surprise.After the madness of Azerbaijan we’re in Spain for the start of the European leg of what is shaping up to be a thrilling F1 season. Lewis Hamilton emerged from the Red Bull chaos in Baku to record his first victory of the season in its fourth race. He holds a four point lead in the drivers’ standings from Sebastian Vettel, who won the first two grands prix of the season before Daniel Ricciardo’s masterclass in China. Hamilton will be on pole at the Circuit de Catalunya, despite saying before this weekend that he had ‘zero comfortability’ with his car. The British world champion won from pole here last year, and will be difficult to beat at a track where overtaking can be tricky, but he was only four-hundredths of a second faster than his Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas in qualifying. The Ferraris of Vettel and Kimi Raikonnen make up the second row, with those dastardly Red Bulls of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen ready to rumble from fifth and sixth on the grid.

In these milder months, there’s no excuse not to be outside as much as possible. Here are nine ideas for inspiration.Ride a waveThe north Cornwall coast, with its big Atlantic seas, is Britain’s premier surf destination, with Fistral beach at Newquay probably the country’s best-known surf beach. But there are great places to learn to surf all around the UK. If you’re after a board experience with a less steep learning curve, stand-up paddleboarding offers the chance to take to the water in an easy-to-learn fashion. As well as the exhilaration of surfing the waves, paddleboarding can be a means of exploring the wonders of Britain’s tranquil inland waterways.Get started: Surfing England (surfingengland.org) has information on surf clubs and learning to surf. The British Stand Up Paddle Association website (bsupa.org.uk) has information on where to learn.See colours in bloomSpring and summer are the best times to explore England’s most glorious gardens. Among the Royal Horticultural Society’s (RHS) stunners is its flagship garden, Wisley in Surrey. Home to one of the world’s largest plant collections, it’s a riot of flowering bulbs and blossoms in spring, with fragrant roses and colourful mixed borders in summer. The RHS also runs summer flower shows around the country, including the world-famous Chelsea flower show. The National Trust is  to more than 200 gardens and landscaped parks, many attached to its historic houses, with Studley Royal water gardens at Fountains Abbey, also a world heritage site, among the best known.Freewheel through forest trailsZip along peaceful country lanes between summer hedgerows, pedal past glowering mountains above Scotland’s Glencoe pass as part of a tour or expedition, race with other cyclists, or even head off-road along forest trails on a mountain bike. Cycling can provide high-adrenaline sport or light, relaxing exercise, but whichever way you ride, getting on a bike gives you an up-close view of the countryside that you’d never get from a car.Get started: Cycling UK (cyclinguk.org) can help you get on the road, with advice on everything from buying a bike to cycling groups and routes.Escape to the countryCity dwellers craving a rural fix should seek out one of the many regional annual outdoor shows, a celebration of farming and rural life, with sheep and cattle competitions, horse and dog shows, sheep-shearing contests and farm machinery displays. These days, though, the events are also packed with family-friendly entertainments, ranging from air displays and carriage-driving races to skateboarding and marching bands. Local producers showcase their food and drink, and makers display arts and crafts.Get started:UK County Shows (ukcountyshows) has countrywide information and links to inidual shows.Swim in scenic surroundingsWhat could be a more perfect summer idyll than plunging into a cool lake or river on a hot, sunny day? Wild swimming – taking a dip in rivers, lakes, streams and waterfalls – has a growing number of fans. Popular spots to swim include Ullswater in the Lake District and lochs throughout Scotland, while rivers in the Brecon Beacons are home to stunning waterfall plunge pools. In the south of England, Pangbourne on the river Thames is one of many popular locations, and there are even urban swims to be had in London’s Serpentine and Highgate ponds.Get started: There’s information on locations throughout the UK and all-important safety tips tips at wildswimming.Soar into the treetopsThere’s a special kind of thrill to hurtling through the treetops suspended on a wire. Locations range from urban parks (such as Heaton Park in Manchester and Battersea Park in London) to mountains and forests. Zip World, with locations in Wales, offers a variety of adventures through forest, over a quarry and even – this one’s for the fitter and more adventurous – underground in caverns. Go Ape has locations throughout England, Scotland and Wales, and a collection of mainly forest-based attractions.Kayak along the waterwaysBritain has thousands of miles of rivers, lakes, reservoirs and canals canoeing (single-ended paddle), or kayaking (double-ended paddle), is a great way to explore them. Assuming you don’t have your own canoe, you’ll need to join a club or go to an activity centre, where staff will generally help new paddlers with an induction session. Sea kayaking is a lot of fun, too, and more experienced paddlers may enjoy canoe polo (just as it sounds) or white-water canoeing. Get started: British Canoeing (britishcanoeing.org.uk) has information on canoe clubs and activity centres around the country, and on canoe hire.Walk this wayWhether it’s a Sunday stroll or a serious hike, there’s no simpler – or cheaper – way to explore Britain’s great outdoors than on foot. The British countryside is laced with public footpaths all you need to get going is a pair of walking boots or sturdy trainers (plus a map and weatherproof gear if you’re going far). Among myriad footpaths, 16 national trails pass through some of the country’s most iconic landscapes. They include the South West Coast Path, with 630 miles of trails snaking around the Dorset, Devon, Cornwall and Somerset coasts, and northern England’s hilly Pennine Way.Get started: National Trails (nationaltrail).

And we’re still waiting for answers to 40 questions that Mike Schroepfer was unable to answer, including if they have any record of any dark ads.“It could be that these adverts are just the tip of the iceberg. It’s just so hard getting any sort of information out of them, and then not knowing if that information is complete.”Preliminary research undertaken by Twitter user Brexitshambles suggests anti-immigrant adverts were targeted at Facebook users in the UK and the US.One – headlined “You’re not the only one to despise immigration”, which cost 4,884 roubles (£58) and received 4,055 views – was placed in January 2016. Another, which accused immigrants of stealing jobs, cost 5,514 roubles and received 14,396 impressions. Organic reach can mean such adverts are seen by a wider audience.Facebook says that it only looked for adverts shown during the officially regulated campaign period. A spokesperson said: “The release of the set of IRA adverts confirms the position we shared with the Electoral Commission and DCMS committee. We did not find evidence of any significant, coordinated activity by the IRA operatives directed towards the Brexit referendum.“This is supported by the release of this data set which shows a significant amount of activity by the IRA with only a handful of their ads listing the UK as a possible audience.”Collins said that the committee was becoming increasingly frustrated by Facebook’s reluctance to answer questions and by founder Mark Zuckerberg’s ongoing refusal to come to the UK to testify.Milner told the committee in February that Cambridge Analytica had no Facebook data and could not have got data from Facebook.The news reinforces MPs’ frustrations with a system that last week many of them were describing as “broken”. On Friday, 15 months after the first Observer article that triggered the Electoral Commission’s investigation into Leave.EU was published, it found the campaign – funded by Arron Banks and endorsed by Nigel Farage – guilty of multiple breaches of electoral law and referred the “responsible person” – its chief executive, Liz Bilney – to the police.Banks described the commission’s report as a “politically motivated attack on Brexit”.Leading academics and MPs called the delay in referring the matter to the police “catastrophic”, with others saying British democracy had failed. Liam Byrne, Labour’s shadow digital minister, described the current situation as “akin to the situation with rotten boroughs” in the 19th century. “It’s at that level. What we’re seeing is a wholesale failure of the entire system. We have 20th-century bodies fighting a 21st-century challenge to our democracy. It’s totally lamentable.”Stephen Kinnock, Labour MP for Aberavon, said it was unacceptable that the Electoral Commission had still not referred the evidence about Vote Leave from Christopher Wylie and Shahmir Sanni – published in the Observer and submitted to the Electoral Commission – to the police. He said: “What they seem to have done, and are continuing to do, is to kick this into the long grass. There seems to be political pressure to kick this down the road until Britain has exited the EU.”He accused the commission of ignoring what he considered key evidence, including about Cambridge Analytica. The commission had found Leave.EU guilty of not declaring work done by its referendum strategist, Goddard Gunster, but said it had found no evidence of work done by Cambridge Analytica.“The whole thing stinks,” Kinnock said. “I wrote to the commission with evidence that the value of work carried out by Cambridge Analytica was around £800,000. The glib way it dismissed the multiple pieces of evidence about the company was extraordinary. I just think it is absolutely not fit for purpose.”Gavin Millar QC, a leading expert in electoral law at Matrix Chambers, said: “Our entire democratic system is vulnerable and wide open to attack. If we allow this kind of money into campaigning on national basis – and the referendum was the paradigm for this – you have to have an organisation with teeth to police it.”Damian Tambini, director of research in the department of media and communications at the London School of Economics, described the whole system as broken and said there was not a single investigatory body that seemed capable of uncovering the truth. “The DCMS has found itself in this extraordinary position of, in effect, leading this investigation because it at least has the power to compel witnesses and evidence – something the Electoral Commission can’t do. It’s the classic British solution of muddling through.“The big picture here is it’s possible for an inidual or group with lots of money and some expertise to change the course of history and buy an election outcome. And with our regulatory system, we’ll never know if it’s happened.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ef41941614c89a23c08234400863d95cf77143/35_497_4299_2579/master/4299.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0421d7b0a1cdaad0cec7ec01a88fbbf0","title":"stage invader storms uks eurovision set","story":"Singer SuRie carries on after invader shouts ‘Nazis of the UK media, we demand freedom’A stage invader has stormed the stage in the middle of UK singer SuRie’s Eurovision performance in Lisbon.The man grabbed the microphone from the 29-year-old singer on Saturday night and screamed “Nazis of the UK media, we demand freedom” before he was wrestled from the stage.The man has since been widely identified as serial stage invader Dr ACactivism who tried to hijack The National Television Awards in January before host Dermot O’Leary pushed him from the stage.And in April 2017 he was identified as the man who tried to disrupt the live final of The Voice.According to his Twitter bio, he is a philosopher, activist and DJ based in London and has written a self-published e-book.SuRie, real name Susanna Marie Cork, clapped in time to the backing track while the camera cut to British fans in the Altice Arena in Lisbon after the Londoner managed to grab her microphone.Once it was back in her hand she sang the lyrics, “Don’t give up,” to huge cheers from the crowdPresenter Graham Norton told viewers: “We are still reeling, there was a stage invasion.”There was an outpouring of support for the singer on social media.JK Rowling wrote: “That was everyone who’s ever been on stage’s worst nightmare and it must have been scary, but what a pro, what a recovery.” Former Eurovision contestant Cheryl Baker tweeted “love your heart” to SuRie and added: “Where was the security? He could have had a weapon!”Eurovision producers offered the singer a chance to perform again at the end of the show, but she declined.The Eurovision song contest tweeted that the man responsible for the stage invasion was taken into police custody after the incident."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/490276454c73f4ee0caa6339e1b6659baf25e8cb/0_195_5138_3082/master/5138.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f64154506343076f3a8a5952e5b13e8","title":"eurovision 2018 five things we learned","story":"Politics is out and props are the new pixels in this glorious age for Europe’s music contestThis year’s Eurovision has been an absolute spectacle, with the final broadcast live from Lisbon’s Altice Arena to an audience of more than 200 million fans worldwide.Whether you love or hate the world’s biggest music show, it’s hard to deny that the modern era of Eurovision offers slick production, quality vocals and a musical smorgasbord that has something for everyone – from Hungarian heavy metal to Estonian popera. The event is the ultimate showcase of inclusivity, musical ersity and fun – fans come from all over the world to support their home country or their European favourites. Here’s what we learned from this year’s contest:1 Politics is out, but statement songs are inPolitical songs are frowned upon in Eurovision – Ukrainian 2016 winner Jamala’s lament on the 1944 Soviet Union deportation of Crimean Tatars raised a few eyebrows, particularly in Russia, at a time of heightened tension between the two countries. But that doesn’t mean you can’t make a statement through song. France’s entry Mercy tells the true story of a baby born last year on a ship rescuing migrants from the Mediterranean, while Netta from Israel reignited Girl Power for the #MeToo generation with her song Toy. The biggest surprise and delight was Ireland, whose entry played out a charming gay love story through dance – something which shouldn’t be a statement, but arguably is while LGBT+ rights are still far from assured in a number of Eurovision nations.2 Don’t mess with the European Broadcasting UnionTalking of Ireland, this year the organisers of Eurovision terminated its contract with Chinese broadcaster Mango TV after the nation opted not to broadcast the Irish performance from the first semi-final – showing a gay relationship contravenes Chinese censorship rules. Mango TV also censored the Albanian performance because their performer Eugent Bushpepa had visible tattoos. The EBU stated that censoring content “is not in line with the EBU’s values of universality and inclusivity and our proud tradition of celebrating ersity through music”. Ireland’s entry Ryan O’Shaughnessy approved: “I think it’s a really important decision by the EBU, they haven’t taken it lightly, and I think it’s a move in the right direction. I’m happy about it.” Well played, EBU. 3 Props are the new pixelsIn recent years the LED backdrop has played a big part in Eurovision staging, with increasingly sophisticated graphics bringing a new dimension to performances. Think Måns Zelmerlow’s stickman graphics from his winning song Heroes in 2015, or Sergey Lazarev’s 3D cityscape from 2016. This year Portugal decided to remove the pixel mesh from the stage, prompting participating countries to rethink how they were going to make a splash. Inevitably this resulted in massive props, including a giant pianocoffin from Ukraine, a vast light-up dress for Estonia and a spinning knife-throwing board for Finland. Best of all was Moldova’s Ikea wardrobes, setting the scene for a physical comedy performance that could never have played out in tiny pixels. More of this please.4 Real music is all musicWhen Salvador Sobral won Eurovision last year, he made a victory speech that railed against “disposable, fast-food music without any content”, calling his win “a victory for people who make music that actually means something”. He added: “Music is not fireworks, music is feeling so let’s try to change this and bring music back, which is really what matters.” This year’s Eurovision is a reminder that what constitutes meaning in music is unique to every listener, whether it’s Swedish pop, Hungarian rock, Irish balladeering or quirky sampling from Israel that’s unlike anything we’ve heard before. Eurovision is a variety box of fabulous fireworks, Salvador – it’s ALL real music, and it’s what makes Eurovision so wonderful. The favourite for this year’s Eurovision has been chopping and changing for weeks, and at the start of the evening it was the most open Grand Final in years – any one of six or seven acts could have taken the winner’s trophy. But in the end it was Israel’s Netta who raised the trophy for her Girl Power anthem Toy, with bonus chicken noises, Bjork-esque styling and lyrics like “I’m taking my Pikachu home”. The voting showed the huge disparity between what the juries loved (Austrian and German ballads, mostly), and what the public wanted to win (Cyprus’s Beyonce-style pop banger and Italy’s duet about the effects of war and terrorism). Netta’s win was loved by both – a triumph for something entirely different, which is exactly what Eurovision is all about.

The crack in pasture land on Kilauea’s east flank was the 16th recorded since the volcano, one of the world’s most active, erupted eight days ago. Thousands of people have fled their homes on Hawaii’s Big Island because of lava and toxic gases, and dozens of homes have been destroyed. The new fissure opened up about a 1.6km east of the existing vent system that has devastated the island’s Leilani Estates neighborhood, with a few homes on the edge of the field where the vent opened. The US Geological Survey has warned that more outbreaks remain likely. Within hours of opening, the fissure had piled reddish-black lava about 12 metres high (40ft) and at least 45 metres (150ft) in length. Chunks of magma were being spewed 30 metres (100ft) in the air. Shortly after the fissure opened, the Geological Survey’s Hawaii volcano observatory said seismic activity remained “elevated” at Kilauea’s 1,200m-high summit. The USGS reported a shallow but small earthquake with a magnitude of 3.5 hit the island on Saturday.Geologists warned on Friday that a steam-driven eruption from the Halemaumau summit could shoot large boulders from the crater and ash plumes 6,100 metres (20,000ft) high. Ash and debris could be spread up to 19km (12 miles). Kilauea’s vents have been oozing relatively cool, sluggish magma left over from a similar event in 1955. Fresher magma could now emerge behind it and the volcano is threatening to start a series of explosive eruptions, scientists have said. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory reported that the new fissure opened a mile north-east of the last fissure and east of the Puna Geothermal Venture plant. No significant lava flow was reported immediately. Plant workers this week removed 50,000 gallons of pentane gas stored at the site.The volcano began spurting lava into a residential neighbourhood last week. On Friday, Donald Trump declared a major disaster on the Big Island. The move will make federal financial assistance available to state and local governments as they repair roads, public parks, schools and water pipes damaged by the eruption.Tourism officials are hoping Kilauea’s eruption will not deter travellers, even though the volcano began spurting lava into a residential neighbourhood last week. George Szigeti, chief executive of the Hawaii Tourism Authority, said Kilauea was being monitored constantly and added that the Big Island is “immense”, with large areas unaffected by the volcano.Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67d49e2d0e72b64983770b0ff62ae35becfe2805/60_656_8036_4821/master/8036.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab8b9d16cb73d932dd283d3abac795fd","title":"unseen photographs of civil rights conflict in birmingham alabama 1963","story":"In spring 1963, African American civil rights activists in Alabama started the Birmingham campaign, a series of sit-ins, boycotts and marches against segregation laws.

The attorney general, Jeremy Wright, told the House of Commons that the prime minister Theresa May had written to Belhaj and Boudchar to apologise for the “appalling” treatment they had received.After the statement, Straw conceded publicly for the first time that he had authorised some of MI6’s actions, despite previously telling MPs that allegations of his involvement in rendition were conspiracy theories. Rifkind, a former chairman of the ISC who served in various cabinet roles under Margaret Thatcher and John Major, told the BBC: “I think it’s absolutely vital and in the public interest that the role of the prime minister and ministers at the time in this affair should become better understood. “Tony Blair was prime minister. He has been uncharacteristically silent, so far as I am aware not a word has he said. Jack Straw said he would love to give evidence to the ISC on those matters relevant to national security where he can’t speak openly.“What is not known is the extent to which the then prime minister and other ministers were party to what MI6 was doing. And we know that Mr Blair took a very strong personal interest in Libya.”Belhaj and Boudchar fought a protracted legal battle over their claim that they were kidnapped and returned to Gaddafi’s regime in a move linked to Blair’s infamous “deal in the desert” with the Libyan leader. “They could quite easily come to the judgment either that ministers, in their view, did not know, or were not involved, or that ministers were ... right up to their necks, as it were. “There will be no reason of national security why either the involvement of the prime minister, or ministers, or their non-involvement, should not be, not only investigated, but the results announced to parliament and to the wider public.” He added that the committee had the right to decide on its own authority whether to carry out such an investigation. During the 2011 Libyan revolution, documents also came to light revealing MI6’s role in the rendition of a second Libyan opposition figure, Sami al-Saadi, who was kidnapped along with his wife and four young children. Straw has said he would be happy to give evidence to the ISC, stating that he sought to act at all times in a manner consistent with his legal duties while foreign secretary. But that would be done behind closed doors, and MPs have called for Straw to give evidence before parliament about his role in the kidnap and mistreatment of the two families. Human rights groups, meanwhile, say there needs to be a broader inquiry, independent of government. "},{"url":null,"title":"what is canada like for a refugee","story":"After the election of the Trudeau Liberals, Canada swiftly rebranded itself as a tolerant, open-armed society. But as alt-right sentiments seep across the border, how welcoming is the country? Omar Mouallem meets the refugees confronting racism, xenophobia – and the very idea of Canadian-nessby Omar Mouallem, for Eighteen BridgesAll Mohammad El Hindawi wanted for his family was a reprieve from the bedbugs afflicting his children. In the summer of 2015, while dealing with the vermin in their new home of Edmonton, he’d learned through a social worker that Canadians apparently loved camping, and so, as a new Canadian, he thought that perhaps this was something he should try. Camping was a new concept to this refugee born and raised in Hama, Syria, site of the Hama massacre of 1982, when the military rounded up 10,000 or 20,000 or 40,000 people for execution (nobody really knows). His father and uncles were spared, but El Hindawi, who was six then, never shed the trauma and bitterness.His whole life has been a struggle, from his early 20s when he lost his firstborn son to measles, right up until 13 November 2014, the day he boarded a plane and flew to Canada – a country he’d never learned about in public school. His life remained a struggle, because he had six kids crying every night, a wife telling him they’d be better off on the streets, and a family panicking over a blood-sucking insect they’d never encountered before. So, yes, camping, whatever camping was, sounded like a great idea.I met El Hindawi on the first sub-zero day of the fall of 2015, at a workshop at Edmonton’s Catholic Social Services, sponsored by the government of Canada, to teach new Canadians about the ancient western art of roughing it in the woods. Along with his wife and kids, he was there to learn, and I was there as a reporter to tell a warm story about immigrants. The 43rd Canadian federal election was a month away and it seemed, at least in the moment, that more than global warming, healthcare, trade, taxes and pipelines, the most important issue to Canadians was Canadian-ness itself, and whether someone like El Hindawi, or his hijab-wearing wife, Nisreene, had andor deserved the right to call themselves Canadian.This debate, however, was all but invisible to the country’s new residents, who could hardly speak their new language, let alone read the news. If there was time between English school, job-hunting, and caring for an infant, three small children and two teens – all while relying upon a confusing public transit system – then that time was spent following the tragic unravelling of their homeland, not the comparatively minor issue of an election they couldn’t vote in.El Hindawi, a middle-class petroleum mechanic in Hama, was involved in anti-government activism for much of their last decade in Syria (against the wishes of Nisreene, who feared for their family). In 2011, when the rebellion began, he gave his vacant rental property to a group of rogue medical professionals who treated injured protesters. He believes a recaptured survivor was the one who ratted on him in March 2012, forcing El Hindawi to flee to Lebanon in a taxi with a friend’s ID. The driver returned two weeks later with the rest of the family, who paid border guards $200 to open the gate.They lived in an apartment with sporadic water supply, surviving off a paltry United Nations allowance and the charity of a friend abroad and some Lebanese, though they found many of their new neighbours to be unwelcoming of refugees. It took 18 months for the UN to resettle them. On a Wednesday morning, he got the call. They were going to Canada – the next day. “Sure, I’ll go to Canada, even though I don’t know what it is or where it is,” Mohammed would later tell me through a translator. “Good – I just want to bring my family to survive, and God knows what’s Canada.”First impressions: Canada is cold, which he assumed when he was given a winter coat on arrival, but didn’t fully comprehend until the frost hit his cheeks outside Edmonton international airport. Canada is also expensive by spring their savings of $9,400 were gone.But Canada is caring, too. An Arab business-owner hired El Hindawi on a construction site, though language difficulties and arthritis meant he was unable to keep the job. Insomnia didn’t help either, but a doctor diagnosed him with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and he’s now receiving treatment for it. They were heartened by the generosity of Edmonton’s Capital Region Housing Corporation, which sheltered the large family at a subsidized rate of just $550 a month. But then came the infestation. Bedbugs. It made it even harder to sleep at night. It made the children miserable. It caused a rift between the parents.Before leaving the camping workshop, El Hindawi showed me pictures of the red pocks on the back of his newborn – the first second generation Canadian for these first generation parents – and asked me to help. It seemed like a worthwhile human interest story for my newspaper, so I took his phone number to pass on to my editor. A week later, another reporter came to his home to write about their living conditions, which turned out to be quite complicated.Numerous health inspectors who’d come to their duplex had deemed it safe. The landlord had sprayed repeatedly for vermin and the El Hindawis had purged the space of any possibly infested object (meaning yet another loss of worldly possessions). Still, the pocks returned. There were few affordable housing options for the family of eight, the most recent inspection found no evidence of bedbugs and the landlord had been taking the complaints seriously. When the facts were laid out in the story and published on the cover of  News, an army of online commentators turned El Hindawi’s family into ammunition for their anti-immigrant campaign.“Ingrates”, “queue-jumpers” and “GO HOME!!!” were typical comments. “How about you go out and get a job Mohammed?” read another. The newspaper deleted and closed the comments section, but not before El Hindawi himself had them read to him. The malice was aggregated and proliferated by alt-right media sites such as The Rebel, owned by Alberta’s infamous and Islamophobic pundit Ezra Levant. The case of the ungrateful and troublesome El Hindawis was used by such sites as clear evidence that Canada needed to keep refugees out.There were sympathetic readers, some of whom called the newspaper to help, but the harsh words still came as a shock to El Hindawi. “I’ve never cried in public, but when I read them I cried,” he said. “I lost my father and my son, but I never cried like that. They hurt me so badly. Their words just touched my soul.” This was not the fair and tolerant Canada the settlement agents told him he was bringing his family to.But it is his Canada, our Canada, a democracy founded on and propagated through various undemocratic practices– cultural genocide, papal bulls, bad-faith treaties – always with the white euro-Christian norm at the centre of the effort to safeguard itself from “the other”, whoever that might be.Ancient Greeks called the others they encountered “barbarians”. Islamic crusaders then (and now, in the form of Isis) called them “infidels”. In the US and Canada, we have many words but generally adhere to the politest one: immigrants. Though the majority of Canadians welcome this “other”, defend this other and identify with this other (because to be a land of one we must be a land of others), they might still distrust this other. And currently, no other in this country is distrusted more than the one who looks like an El Hindawi.An Angus Reid survey of national attitudes toward religions showed more Canadians have negative than neutral views of Muslims, and it is a big gap down to the next religion on the list. Prejudice against Islam is highest in Quebec, where two-thirds admit to it, and where six Muslim men were gunned down in the middle of prayer last January by a white nationalist who cultivated a pro-Trump fanaticism online. The massacre happened the weekend Donald Trump signed an executive order enacting a legal version of his promised “Muslim Ban”, motivated by fears of an Islamic takeover “like Europe”, said the shooter. But such a tragedy was probably inevitable, Trump or no. Though hate crimes in general are declining, they are not declining against Canada’s one million Muslims. In fact, they have more than doubled between 2012 and 2014. These are numbers reported before Trump, before Brexit, before the Burka Ban and Barbaric Cultural Practises hotline. Before Nice and San Bernadino. Before Orlando and Berlin. “Someday something bad will happen in this country,” El Hindawi told me, “and as a Syrian refugee I’ll be in trouble.”Or that Ahmed had an advantage over Aboriginals. “In Canada,” my father would tell me, “if you work hard you will succeed.” The lesson, as I interpreted it, was that labour and location were the critical factors success had nothing to do with race, religion or anything else.In August 2016, I asked my father to translate during an interview with Mohammed El Hindawi. As I drove from my parents’ spacious modern home on Edmonton’s north side to an aged pink row-house deep on the south side, I asked Ahmed, a businessman without a high school degree who’d retired at 49 if he thought Syrian refugees would have the same shot at success that he had. He said that they have it even easier with so much government support that kind of direct support didn’t exist in the early 70s. I recast my question to be generally about Muslim immigrants. “Maybe in the States they’d have problems, because of 911 and so many other things where the Muslim was involved. But right here, no,” he said. “I never worry because I have the best neighbours. We respect each other and always say hi, even the Vietnamese guy. So if you just walk straight, ignore what’s around you, work hard, you don’t have to worry about nothing. Just look at your future in the right way, and you’ll be OK.”His faith in Canada was, and is, unshakable. I parked and we stepped out of the car, but 10 metres from Mohammed El Hindawi’s front door, I began to fear that he had texted me the wrong address. A dreamcatcher was floating in the entryway of the town-home. I turned to my translator, concerned, but then we heard Arabic music wafting out an open window. Before I knocked, El Hindawi greeted us with his middle son, Wael, a short kid with chubby arms who reminded me of myself at 12. El Hindawi, a 39-year-old with stubble on his chin and who dressed youthfully in an untucked pink polo, looked nothing like my dad, a man who’d been wearing dark dress shirts tucked into pleated pants for the 31 years I’d known him.I asked El Hindawi about the dreamcatcher. He said he’d found it at the Value Village. “Do you know what it is?” I said.A concerned look overcame Wael. “Haram?” he asked. Sinful. It was one of the two hundred or so Arabic words I knew.“No haram,” I said. “This is from the original people of Canada. It’s one the most Canadian things you can own. It keeps away the bad dreams.”“Good,” said El Hindawi, whose English had greatly improved in the last 11 months. He told me that he’d just returned from a weeklong trip camping to Sylvan Lake, a couple hours south of Edmonton. They drove there as a family, and it wasn’t even their first camping trip that summer.He and his wife Nisreene, who was upstairs tending to their 18-month-old daughter, had spare time on their hands now that the children were back in school. Mohammed was still unemployed, and frustratingly so since he’d worked so hard to learn English, but otherwise he was noticeably more relaxed than when I’d first met him. The bedbugs were gone. The children safe and integrating. He felt more confident speaking up for himself. The newspaper article about his family’s dilemma didn’t just inflame the internet’s fringe right, but it also sparked rumours in his largely ethnic neighbourhood. He said there was word going around that social services were going to take away his children. “But the last five, six months, better,” he said, smiling.They welcomed us into their living room. His neighbour Sharef Sharf, was sitting on the couch. Like El Hindawi, Sharf had arrived from Syria via Lebanon, but he’d arrived post-election, after Canada had decided, with a resounding “yes”, to accept more refugees. Perhaps it was the relief of having brought his wife and three small children to safety, or maybe it was arriving in a rebranded tolerant Canada on one of the first planeloads of 25,000 promised refugees, but Sharf seemed to almost glow from the inside out. While Wael doted on us with an overflowing pot of sweetened Turkish tea, Sharf used a big smile and a patchwork of English and Arabic to weave the story of his escape from Syria.Sharf lived in a village near Daraa, the spark that lit the Syrian civil war in 2011 when a group of boys aged 10 to 15 inspired by the Arab Spring spray-painted “the people want to topple the regime” on a wall in plain view. The boys were arrested, interrogated, tortured and, they believed, prepared for execution. Massive protests saved their lives. Sharf, who ran a construction company in Daraa, was hesitant to get involved in the uprising, given that the military violently and fatally suppressed opposition. The burgeoning checkpoints worried him, as did the rebel commanders who overtook those checkpoints, but, he said, as long as he could feed his children he had no reason to leave.Then, on the seventh day of Ramadan in 2012, a missile landed directly outside the family’s home as they were about to break fast. His six-year-old daughter was hurled out a two-storey window by the impact. Outside, he scooped her up, a leg dangling backwards over his arm. With his family in tow, he carried her five kilometres to a hospital, where doctors wrapped sticks around her legs and sent them away. The next time he saw their home was in a picture, months later, after they had fled to Lebanon. “It was like gravel,” he told me.Here was a middle-class man whose entire life was uprooted in an instant. I couldn’t fathom abandoning everything you owned, almost everyone you knew, at a moment’s notice. I asked him how difficult that decision must have been, but he didn’t understand the question. I turned to my father to translate my question into Arabic, but he interjected. “It was not a hard decision,” my translator assured me, who until this moment was doing his job without apparent editorialization. “Trust me.”I insisted he ask Sharf the question. He complied.“It wasn’t even a choice,” said Sharf. “It is life or death. I am life after death.”Sharf did not share El Hindawi’s worry about Canadians turning on him and people like him. It seemed implausible given the welcoming he received in Canada in January 2016. “This is my sponsorship family,” he said, handing me his phone to look at a picture of 20 people posing with his wife and children at the Edmonton international airport, most of them Chinese Canadians from a Mandarin church, as well as people of European and Indo-Asian backgrounds. Sharf lurched forward and flicked the screen. There was Justin Trudeau, with his arm around Sharf and his son. When his children grow up, Sharf said, he’ll tell them that they can become doctors because of the prime minister. “Justin Trudeau is our hero. A hero to my little boy.” As for Canada’s last prime minister, all Sharf understood about him was: “He made us wait two years.”After the election of the Trudeau Liberals, Canada swiftly rebranded itself as a tolerant and open-armed society. Within months of the parliamentary exchange of power, the foreign press gushed over the nation’s treatment of refugees in stark contrast to most of the rest of the western world. Canada has accepted a relatively small number of Syria’s 6 million refugees, but the Trudeau government continues to hail its comparatively small effort within hours of Trump’s recent indefinite ban on Syrian refugees and four-month ban on all others, Trudeau tweeted a photo of himself hugging a Syrian boy at an airport, the visual message being that Canada was there to help.They would not, however, raise Canada’s refugee quota – or scrap a policy that blocks US migrants from seeking asylum up north, forcing some asylum seekers to literally lose digits and limbs to frostbite as they sneak across our open borders. Still, for many of the migrants who’ve already arrived, the reputation is warranted. “Something I like very much here in Canada is they call us newcomers, not refugees,” said Daroo Karajoul, a cosmopolitan Kurdish Syrian with a gem ear piercing.I met Karajoul at a central Edmonton Lebanese restaurant for hookah and shish kebab. Two other Syrian men, Basel Abou Hammrah and Morhaf Aldiri, joined us. Speaking demographically, the men I sat with ticked the boxes of the crude caricatures people create to represent the problems immigration brings. They are single men in their mid-20s. Two of them are Muslim. All arrived thanks to the Liberals’ resettlement campaign that their Conservative opponents warned could allow for contamination by extremists. Yet they have found few, if any, indications that they are not welcome here. If anything, Canadians can be overly accommodating, said Karajoul, noting a visiting neighbour who worried she had offended him with her exposed shoulders.“Here, they treat us as human,” said Abou Hammrah, a clean-shaven Arab Christian. “They encourage you to do things with your life.” Abou Hammrah, an accountant who moved to Edmonton with his mother and siblings (his father died of stress-related causes during the war), told me his experiences in Canada are starkly different from those in Lebanon, where they slept five to a tent and were interrogated at checkpoints outside the camp.Aldiri, a student of French literature, echoed the treatment among his fellow Sunni Muslims in Jordan: “The camp was like a zoo in the middle of the desert. You can’t leave and there’s police around you everywhere.” When his family moved into an apartment in the capital Amman, they later learned that they were renting it at 10 times the cost as their neighbours. Any complaints were met with: If you don’t like it here, go back! “Nobody saw us as a human,” he said. “Just as an economic problem. It was very racist.”The treatment of his family and fellow Syrians wasn’t racist in the literal sense. Aldiri and his discriminators were of the same race, and likely the same religion, sharing more or less the same basic customs and speaking the same language. But they were stripped of their humanity and whittled down to undesirable objects. Subjected to everything that we’ve come to understand as racism. But it does beg the question: What, precisely, is racism? And how is it expressed in places typically known for being tolerant? Places like Canada.Canada’s particular brand of prejudice might be called “democratic racism”, which is essentially how the sociologist Frances Henry characterized multiculturalism as a tool to rationalize racial disadvantages and keep “white dominance” intact. Other sociologists have dubbed Canada’s attitudes towards the other as “polite racism”. Whatever we call the prejudice that flows under, and sometimes on, the surface of our society, it might be epitomized by the living conditions of indigenous people living in Canada, who have suffered “more hardship than the African American population in the US”, according to data analyzed by Maclean’s in 2015. Taking into account factors such as life expectancy, high school drop-out rates and median income, the descendants of slaves in racially charged America are living better lives than our First Peoples.Even as racism has been largely written out of Canadian law – ending the “Head Tax” on Chinese immigrants, closing Japanese internment camps and shuttering the last residential school in 1996 (though the Indian Act remains in good standing) – racism is given air in Canada through the right to hold and disseminate racist opinions. Many of Canada’s current hate speech laws were formed in the 1970s to combat a surge of antisemitic incidents, but in 2014, a crucial law, section 13 of the Human Rights Code, a special provision for hate speech online, was repealed. (Curiously, the next year, government passed bill C-52 to crack down on online recruitment and propaganda by Islamic terrorists.) But in the noble pursuit of protecting free speech, lifting the internet clause has created a safe place for outlets such as Rebel Media, which has over half a million YouTube subscribers.It may have also helped take the shackles off sites like Stormfront Canada, a popular white supremacy forum from the internet’s halcyon days, whose users are “disproportionately responsible for some of the most lethal hate crimes and mass killings” since 1995 (over one hundred murders between 2009 and 2014 alone), according to the US-based Southern Poverty Law Centre.Stormfront members and online spreaders of hate speech once hid behind screen names, but now Facebook commentators more often use links that identify them (all part of the ongoing validation of the views they represent). Irfan Chaudhry, a former criminologist and now a University of Alberta PhD candidate who researches racism online, says the unveiled nature of Facebook especially gives him access to real people using real names and real faces. He admits that data gathered from social media is imperfect and anecdotal, but it remains the most open pathway to gaining insight into Canadians’ sentiments on minorities. “The sentiment’s always existed, but it’s just now more visible,” he told me in the days leading up to the US election. “The reality chips away at what some envision as Canada’s greatest strength – multiculturalism and the acceptance of others. When you start digging at the surface, we’re not very accepting.”Karajoul accepts prejudice as a fact of life because, as a minority Kurd, he’s been on the receiving end of it everywhere he’s lived – Syria, Turkey and even Canada, where a man on Tinder rejected him with the message: “White is right.” It was no big deal. He always dreamed of a place where there are “no borders”. And Canada, to him, is the closest thing to it. “It’s like a garden of people. All these different flowers and smells.”But snakes slither in this garden. Certainly, the white nationalist movement could infiltrate the government, as it seems to have in America. There are also Islamic extremists who could reverse popular opinion, as they have in Germany, where the doors were thrown wide open early on but where there has now been a backlash. There have been protests of significant size, namely those staged by the Dresden nationalist group Pegida (“Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West”). The Soldiers of Odin, a white nationalist vigilante group founded in Finland less than two years ago, now has chapters in every major Canadian city, where they’re known to whitewash their intimidation campaigns by volunteering at homeless shelters or shovelling elderly people’s driveways. Polite racism indeed.My request to interview a member of Soldiers of Odin was denied by the Edmonton president, but I was able to speak with Jenny Hill (a pseudonym), the president of Pegida Canada. She immediately recoiled at my use of the word Islamophobia to describe the sentiment of her group. “The term is a non-word,” she told me over the phone. “I guess you could say we fear Islam. I fear Sharia law coming into Canada. In that case, you could say I am Islamophobic.”As an outspoken critic, Hill fears violent backlash. Pegida’s small Toronto rallies have been outnumbered by counter-protesters from the anti-fascist group Antifa, who’ve called them “Nazi scum”. On one occasion, police stopped their protest, concerned it would escalate to violence. Hill doesn’t doubt that her group has attracted some neo-Nazis, and said she goes through great efforts to remove racist comments when they appear. (A cursory scroll shows either that “racist comments” is a relative term or Hill is having trouble keeping up with her workload.) Ironically, she was less fearful of Muslims than extreme leftists. She’s never had a negative encounter with a Muslim person, she admitted. “We are concerned about the ideology. The amount of Muslims that are killed by other Muslims because of a difference in doctrine or how they follow the Qur’an is huge and horrible. We think they’re victims of their ideology.”Throughout my childhood and adolescence, I didn’t so much try to reconcile my dual heritage as deny it. It was humiliating to hear my parents speak Arabic in public, and, to this day, I speak a fraction of the Arabic my siblings can. I avoided most of my parents’ food, rejected their dances, resented their chauvinism. Growing up in a small town in the conservative heartland, it seemed as a family – these funny-sounding Muslim pita-eaters – that we went through great efforts to other ourselves. We held a relatively fine standing in the world, however, something I understood from the earliest jokes I learned on the schoolyard, like, “What do you call three Indians in a ditch?” (A sleepover.) Behind our closed doors, there was distrust of all the others – whites, Natives, smaller Muslims sects, and especially Jews, though I didn’t actually meet one until high school – but outside our household doors my family wished to be accepted as honorary whites. And we were, even to the point of being embraced as such in our community.And this is where a reader could reasonably expect me to write: “And then 911 happened.” But the truth is that 911 happened and not much changed in our immediate world. Yes, there were more people suddenly interested in my background and a few wisecracks (Omar bin Laden) that I laughed off. But we lost neither friends nor customers at our family restaurant, which was busier than ever thanks to an oil boom. The bigger change was within myself. Even if I didn’t feel like I was being treated suspiciously, I internalized the fear of radical Islam, and exercised any faith left inside me by joining a “skeptics” group and antagonizing street-preachers whenever time allowed it.Some of the authors I was reading at the time (Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens) cautioned against all supernatural beliefs, and all religions, but when it came to Islam the message tended to be more heavy-handed. Many writers and thinkers I came across felt the Qur’an espoused misogyny, bloodlust and global domination, that Muslim immigrants are populating Europe so quickly and birthing so many babies, that by the end of the 21st century it will be a Muslim majority continent, or that Islam promotes a culture of conquest and its followers wish to impose Sharia law (the first I’d heard of it). Most worrying of all was that these writers believed Islam was “incompatible” with western values. In a sense, they feared Islam would conquer the west just as Christians did, systematically purging non-believers through genocide and indoctrination. The way Pegida’s Jenny Hill, an ardent Christian, felt about a religious takeover surely echoed what Indigenous peoples felt as they watched their practices and visibility erased from the landscape. Hill, after some consideration, agreed that it wasn’t so different. “I don’t want that oppression to happen again.”Today, there is no propaganda machine more effective than fear-mongering around Islamic extremism. With Isis’s barbarism and attacks on the west ratcheting up the hysteria, Islamophobia has gone mainstream. Would-be Alberta premier and former immigration minister Jason Kenney tweets bogus images of religious enslavement. The National Post covers a dubious self-published study alleging extremist views in average mosques. Conservative MP and leadership candidate Kellie Leitch – whose selling point to the base is a “non-Canadian values test” for new immigrants (a clear dog-whistle about Sharia-hysteria) – defends the Trump administration’s right to register Muslims, ban immigration from Muslims nations and concentrate their counter-extremism efforts exclusively on Islam.When our political and media figures adopt or endorse xenophobia, it gives social licence to the harboured racism of the segment of the general public that once kept such views under wraps. I began to see this clearly in the lead-up to Canada’s 2015 federal election (and it hasn’t subsided). A balloon artist busking in downtown Edmonton, upon learning my name, joked that he’d create a “terrorist” for me (whatever that would look like). On Twitter, I’m blocking users spamming me with anti-Muslim or anti-Arab epithets like Whack-a-Mole. In full view on Facebook, friends touted “Canadian values” and decried settling refugees over helping “our own”.A childhood friend recently posted a graphic video of a young straight couple being stoned to death by Isis, supposedly because of their inter-religious relationship, adding a rant against letting any more of “these people” through our borders. Did it not occur to her that “these people” could have been the murdered lovers, not the stone throwers? That they were just newer versions of the Mouallems and Mourads (my mother’s maiden name), who also left a war-torn country to build a better life. If you want to know what Syrian refugees want from our country, there are now 40,000 of them you can ask. “My dream,” Mohammed El Hindawi told me, “is that my kids will be doctors so one day they can go to Syria and look after the people and tell them about the life they found in Canada.” But even though Canadians elected Trudeau’s refugee-friendly government, repeated polls show we are almost evenly split on whether to take them in. And there is ample evidence to be found, without having to spend much time looking, that our welcoming attitude sits in fragile balance.Because of the rise in women in headscarves who are being assaulted, and harassed, an increasing number of self-defence courses for Muslim women are being offered across Canada. I observed one, last fall, where 50 Muslim women in loose-fitting clothes gathered in an Edmonton school gymnasium. This course was organized by Alberta Muslim Public Affairs Council (Ampac), which also created an “Islamophobia hotline”. Ampac was launched after the Harper government proposed a ban on taking citizenship oaths under a niqab or burka. “That’s when things started changing,” Nakita Valerio, who sits on the council, told me during the self-defence course. “People I know started talking to me about how Islam is not like other religions, repeating things about the hyper-sexualization of our men, a lot of talk about the hijab. I feel like I’m under the microscope more.”She had never expected this moment to come to Canada. Europe, where her family is from, yes, but not here. Six years ago, while in Florence, without any provocation whatsoever, a man grabbed Valerio by her head-scarf and whipped her into traffic while yelling at her to go home. Had he managed to tear off her headscarf, and not just chunks of hair, he would perhaps have seen that the Italian Canadian Muslim convert looked no different from his daughter. It was Valerio’s first week wearing the hijab, and since moving back to her birthplace, Canada, Valerio has committed herself to countering Islamophobia. Last December, when a senior citizen was captured on video taunting hijabis at an Edmonton train station with a noose while singing O, Canada, Valerio and a friend returned to the scene of the crime to distribute flowers to women in headscarves for a day. The day after the Quebec City mosque shooting, she co-organized a vigil with close to 3,000 attendees braving the frigid Edmonton weather. The outpouring of support heartens her, but Valerio has a less-than-optimistic forecast for Muslims. “I worry that people will get lost and burnt out, and as a result lessen their ability to take action. A similar set of circumstances happened before the second world war.” Valerio, who is a student of Jewish Holocaust studies, added: “As a veiled woman, I say, with no disrespect to the Holocaust, that we are today’s Jews.”The comparison is jarring, but clear parallels between 20th-century antisemitism and 21st-century Islamophobia are emerging. The uncapturably sickening treatment of Jews, not just in the last century, but throughout so many historical periods, is a pattern that appears to be finding a new modern expression. Frances Henry, a Jewish refugee of Hitler’s Germany, and co-author of The Colour of Democracy: Racism in Canadian Society, recognizes the rhetoric coming from rightwing populism. “What are we to make of it,” she writes, “other than there is a new scapegoat?”Isis has, of course, simply carried the fear of the other to its logical conclusion, an all-out global war, and is appealing to the disenfranchised abroad using the same online tools as white supremacists. The more intolerant the west becomes, the easier their job. With every Islamophobic event another alienated Muslim is radicalized. With every terrorist attack, another alienated non-Muslim is radicalized.Despite the various xenophobic undercurrents flowing through their new home, Mohammed El Hindawi and Sharef Sharf have nevertheless fully embraced the values of multiculturalism. Not that they are naive about the precariousness of tolerance. Worried that another attack perpetrated by Muslim extremists will compromise his living conditions, El Hindawi told me, “If I find out that one of my neighbours is doing these things, I will take them to the police myself.”By the end of our evening together, my father had all but given up on translating, and it became three men fervently debating in Arabic about Canadian cultural differences and the futility of Middle Eastern politics. It felt like a scene from my childhood, sitting quietly in living rooms, with abundant fruit, tea and sweets spread across a coffee table, being entertained by the impassioned discussions of adults. I overheard, in my limited Arabic, my father ask if they worried that their religion and culture would be seduced away from his children. Sharf said he wasn’t the slightest concerned, and he and my father debated over the importance of retaining their culture. “Don’t you want your kids to stay Muslim, marry a Muslim, and not say, ‘Get away from me’ to the parents?” my dad asked, apparently unconcerned that Exhibit A in this argument, his son, was beside him.“No,” said Sharf, shaking his head. “We will just do what we can do.”I interjected, and asked Sharf what he wanted from his new life. He paused, appearing suddenly emotional and silent, and thought about it with a blissful smile. “Don’t start singing now,” my dad joked, anticipating the man might break out in song.Sharf laughed. “Our goals are just to survive.” He looked at each of us in turn. “These are not big goals.”Looking for more great work from Eighteen Bridges, the magazine of narrative journalism from Alberta, Canada?

Illustration: Michael VineyA friend who lives on a windy hilltop, in a house nestled in trees, called to tell of a strange smell in her woodshed. There was something, perhaps, going on in one corner, behind a pile of tools. She had glimpsed a furry tail.This is the season when furry animals have babies – and a leafy hilltop adjoining conifer forestry made the pine marten, notorious for siting its nursery in attics and sheds, the likely candidate.A listen at the door was rewarded by sounds of mewing from the corner, as of kittens. The scatter of droppings on the floor matched that of Martes martes, or the Irish cat crainn. We retreated, happy that Ireland’s rarest mammal, long in slow revival after centuries of decline, was staking out a new domain above the western shore.What might have clinched the matter was the distinctive smell of the scat, so often described as like that of Parma violets, even by people without great experience either of the flower or of the scented English sweet of the same name.As a connoisseur of the musky, unmistakable aroma of otter spraint – sampled from the greenest, best-fertilised tufts of grass on stream banks – I was quite looking forward to a new olfactory experience. The overwhelming fragrance of the shed, however, was that of Jeyes Fluid, my friend being one of many householders repelled by the alternative odour, redolent of violets or not.I did not have to go far online, indeed, to find a blog complaining of “having to move downstairs” to escape the pong of a pine-marten den in a roof space. So mixed, indeed, are responses to these intrusions that the Vincent Wildlife Trust has put a special leaflet online: The Pine Marten in Ireland: A Guide for Householders. It could be prudent reading for people now returning to their rural holiday houses.The shortage of natural den sites in Ireland (notably in trees old enough to have big holes) has made houses and sheds attractive to female martens seeking seasonal warmth and safety. They are a long-protected species, and will abandon their kits if disturbed.The two or three young themselves will want to play by night – martens are largely nocturnal. So their noisy skittering on bedroom ceilings can be unwelcome. But from March to July, action to evict a family could bring prosecution under the Wildlife Act.The Vincent trust readily admits that martens “do not make good house guests” and urges proofing the house against invasion. But the animals are superlative climbers and can squeeze through gaps as big as their head (5cm for females).A second leaflet, supported by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, addresses more of the martens’ misbehaviours. How to eExclude Pine Martens from Game and Poultry Pens describes in detail electric fencing to protect the gun clubs’ pheasant chicks and ways of making a henhouse martenproof.All this may stir questions about what pine martens are “good for” and reinforce the wilder concerns for newborn lambs and babies left out in their prams. The predatory diet of this much-abused native mammal includes neither (except, at times, bits of dead lamb) and embraces even frogs, snails, beetles and blackberries. More helpfully to humans, it is a control on rodent populations and its hunting of rats and mice, bank vole and white-toothed shrew extends even to grey squirrels.This, as recent Irish research has shown, can help restore numbers of the native red squirrel. The red is lighter and more agile, and can retreat to the far ends of branches, while the bigger grey also spends more time on the ground and is easier to catch.This study, carried out in Co Wicklow woods by Dr Emma Sheehy of the University of Aberdeen, found the fur of grey squirrels, but not of reds, in marten scats. It has had wide attention in Britain, where restoration of the marten in Scotland, Wales and northern England and conservation of red squirrels are priorities.In Ireland, meanwhile, the research has been intensive, including genetic study of DNA from marten hairs left in sticky tubes baited with raw chicken. This helped the large-scale assessment of the marten population published last year by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.Led by Dr Declan O’Mahony of Northern Ireland’s Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, the report identified 134 inidual martens at sites spread across the island, with an average low density of about one animal per square kilometre of forest. Combining this with other data, the total population in Ireland was estimated at 3,043. This confirmed the pine marten as a settled and stable resident, but still one of the rarest mammals in Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"National Lottery says ticket for biggest jackpot of 2018 bought in Loughrea service stationDUP says T\u0026aacutenaiste is \u0026lsquobelligerent, interfering and Brit bashing\u0026rsquo and trying to break-up UKMayor of Boston Marty Walsh tells Galway event solution cannot just be for the IrishGrace Rattigan says CervicalCheck advised doctor not to tell family of incorrect smearDublin City Council recommends declining Harry Crosbie\u0026rsquos offer of loan of sculptureEcologist Matt Hodd (42) who founded local poetry event had last been seen near riverThomas Doherty (27) found dead in Crawford Square area on Saturday morningMother of late singer Dolores O\u0026rsquo Riordan says her daughter completely opposed to abortionAirline says complications following an aircraft change meant four fans left behindSimon Harris says he would like to see Irish laboratories screening smear testsArchbishop of Dublin expresses his sadness at the tragic death\u0026lsquoThis is not a vote of Yes or No . . . it\u0026rsquos whether we want to make healthcare safe and regulated\u0026rsquoIreland is likely to support UK proposal at EU summitNew awards to recognise respect, loyalty, selflessness, courage and integrity of membersInvestigation underway after blaze breaks out in early hours of Saturday morning\u0026lsquoI find a serious sense of healing in it and a connectedness to those who have gone\u0026rsquoCalls returned after check on records, data quality, and linking with health professionals \u0026ndash HSECoffee keeps the Salthill crowds going but there\u0026rsquos no sign of Ed SheeranHSE director-general\u0026rsquos final months in office marred by multiple controveries"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3492264.1526067134!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit may expected to push for a customs partnership","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May. Irish support for her “customs partnership” proposal will be forthcoming only if she faces down the hard Brexiteers in her cabinet. Photograph: Tolga Akmentolga AkmenAFPGetty ImagesThe Government expects British prime minister Theresa May to push ahead with proposals for a new “customs partnership” which it believes could pave the way for a soft Brexit, and which Dublin will support at next month’s European Union summit.The  understands the British government has told Dublin about the proposals, and the Government is likely to back Ms May at the summit.However, Irish support will be forthcoming only if Ms May faces down the hard Brexiteers in her cabinet and her government shows progress on a common understanding of the border “backstop”, the commitment to maintain an open border even without agreement.Downing Street has told Dublin it has problems with the backstop, but that Ms May’s proposals on a customs partnership would lessen the importance of the arrangement.Government sources agree that the potency of the backstop would be decreased and that it would become “less important” for Ms May if she put forward a customs proposal. It would make it “less offensive” to the DUP, which supports Ms May’s government.While further work would be needed on any customs proposal – even if Ms May gets it through her cabinet – it would “point to a direction of travel” from the UK government of where it wants to go, say sources. It would not be “a solution in itself”.The proposal would see British officials collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for any goods coming to the UK that were subsequently destined for an EU member state. The EU has already rejected this model, and a willingness to look afresh – even if it only “provides the basis” for future talks, according to one source – will be seen as a softening of the Irish and EU position. Earlier this week, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said of Ms May’s customs proposal: “The view of the EU is that it isn’t workable in its current form but it is something that perhaps we could make workable.”The backstop – which would ensure no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland without agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border – was agreed in principle in December, although the UK has rejected the EU’s legal interpretation of it.However, in tandem with the customs proposal, the British government must “at a minimum” table its own interpretation of the backstop in the weeks before the June summit.It was further argued that the tabling of a customs proposal would make it easier for the backstop to “go green” – be agreed – and this would “leave space for the legal experts” to iron out the details over the summer.In effect, the mooted move would mean the EU taking Ms May’s proposal seriously in order to help her agree to the backstop. Senior Government figures believe the DUP’s priority is now that the North should be treated no differently to the rest of Britain, even if this means staying in a UK-wide customs partnership which would replicate many of the features of the customs union.DUP leader Arlene Foster has said Northern Ireland must move in “lockstep” with the rest of the UK.Although Ms May has said she could not accept the EU’s interpretation of the backstop, the Government is adamant the fallback option must be included in any Brexit deal. “We still need the backstop,” said a senior Government source."},{"url":null,"title":"peston ireland has undermined britain for over 100 years","story":"  May 6, 2018TV presenter Robert Peston makes the claim during interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg   May 9, 2018TV presenter moves to clarify controversial remarks made on his Sunday programme   May 11, 2018Some of Theresa May\u0026rsquos problems stem from her relationship with the DUP "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3493583.1526214453!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit coveney says may s vision of customs partnership could work","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney (right) with the  EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. On Sunday Mr Coveney said we are talking about a political solution ‘that prevents the need for border infrastructure’.  Photograph: PA  Tánaiste Simon Coveney said the Irish Government is “not flexible” over the possible deployment of any physical infrastructure along the Irish Border following Brexit. The Minister for Foreign Affairs also warned of a “very difficult summer” if a workable solution for the border was not achieved by June.His comments came on Sunday in the wake of isions in the British cabinet over the failure so far to agree a detailed policy on the border post-Brexit. A proposal by British prime minister Theresa May for a customs partnership arrangement perhaps involving the UK collecting import tariffs on behalf of the EU has rubbished by foreign secretary Boris Johnson as “crazy”.Mr Johnson has criticised the idea of a partnership or shared customs territory, insisting it would prevent the UK taking back control of its trading policies.Responding to Mr Coveney’s remarks, Democratic Unionist MP Sammy Wilson, one of Mr Coveney’s most vocal critics, branded him “belligerent, interfering and Brit bashing” and accused him of trying to break up the UK.On Sunday Mr Coveney said: “To be honest we don’t take our lead from Boris Johnson, we take our lead from the prime minister Theresa May. She has signed up for very firm commitments and I believe her by the way. She made those in good faith.”He said Ms May’s vision of a partnership - where the UK collects tariffs on behalf of Brussels - could provide the basis for negotiating a solution to the vexed problem of maintaining a free flowing Irish Border. Mr Coveney said the UK had made a clear commitment in last December’s agreed UKEU text that there would be no physical infrastructure on the border.This backstop would mean regulations between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic would continue to align post-Brexit, even if a broader trading deal between the UK and EU failed to materialise.Responding to the remarks, Democratic Unionist MP Sammy Wilson, one of Mr Coveney’s most vocal critics, branded him “belligerent, interfering and Brit bashing” and accused him of trying to break up the UK.Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme, Mr Coveney said the Irish Government had shown flexibility in agreeing to broader negotiations going on despite reservations about the agreement in December.“I am not flexible when it comes to border infrastructure. I never have been. The British prime minister is signed up to a clear agreement on no border infrastructure of any kind and no related checks and controls.“That means we are not talking about cameras and scanning systems and drones here - it means we are talking about a political solution that allows for regulatory alignment in a way that prevents the need for border infrastructure,” he said.Mr Coveney said without progress by the end of next month”I think we are going to have a very difficult summer for these negotiations if that happens.”On Sunday Mr Wilson,accused Mr Coveney of burying his head in the sand by refusing to consider technological solutions.“The fact is that the border issues can all be dealt with by technology but Coveney and co have stuck their head in the sand refusing even to consider this solution.”A hard border and the break-up of the UK in terms of different regulatory systems had been ruled out, the East Antrim MP said.“That leaves only one solution. That’s the solution of using the technology that is available and of course getting a deal between the UK and EU which gives free trade arrangements, an arrangement which suits both sides.”“Instead he tried to flog his ‘pig in a poke’ solution to the EU negotiators and force it down the throat of the UK government.“It won’t work. The IRA failed to dislodge Northern Ireland from the UK with bombs, Coveney won’t do it with Brexit.“The UK always has the option to walk away from these negotiations with no deal.“That really would set the cat among the pigeons as far as the Irish economy is concerned because most of their exports to the UK would face huge tariffs and of course the import substitution which would result would massively benefit Northern Ireland agriculture and food processing.“Think about that Mr Coveney - it might cool your republican ardour.” Separately, on Sunday Mrs May reiterated her intention to withdraw from the Customs Union without imposing a hard border in Ireland.Writing in the Sunday Times she said “there will have to be compromises” but any deal must honour the NI peace agreements. - Additional reporting PA -the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3490565.1526048208!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit and ireland the border is a sideshow if you re an eel","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAttempts to conserve the Irish branch of the European eel have been complicated by BrexitThe autumn spawning migration of the European eel (s. Anguilla anguilla) to the Sargasso Sea is one of the great animal migrations.It is an arduous 6,500km journey from Europe’s inland waterways for the seriously endangered species which is threatened by historic overfishing and the degradation and loss of its habitats due to land reclamation, the construction of dams and reductions in water quality.And now attempts to conserve the Irish branch of the family have been, at the very least, complicated by, of all things, Brexit, their fate tied to the prospects for maintaining a frictionless border between North and South on the Erne river at Ballyshannon.The decline of eel stocks in Lough Erne, where commercial fishing has been halted, has been attributed in part to the attrition of both elvers entering the river from the Atlantic and of developed silver eels descending from Lough Erne through the turbines of the ESB hydroelectric power station.The EU requires member states to develop eel management plans and to take measures to ensure that at least 40 per cent of adult eels can escape from inland waters to the sea where they spawn. On the Erne that has meant the seasonal deployment of lorries with aerated water tanks to transport trapped live eels around the turbines.The protection of the eel is just one of 142 areas of North-South co-operation that are underpinned by joint obligations to EU regulations and to the Belfast Agreement, and which form a key part of the Irish strand of the Brexit discussions.They are a measure of the complex interdependence of both the cross-Border relationship and the scale and scope of the talks process.For the most part there is no question of the UK wishing to repudiate any of programmes that range from environmental projects to cross-Border hospitals, but EU negotiators and their UK counterparts have to work on legal language to copperfasten their post-Brexit future.The eels – provisions for safeguarding the EU’s management plan and regulating the cross-Border transport of live animals – will have their special place in Annex 2.8 of the Irish protocol to the Brexit orce deal, the Withdrawal Agreement, currently being discussed by the two sides.Discussions about the controversial Border “backstop” – an agreement would fully align Northern Ireland with the rules of the EU to avoid a hard border – have tended to catch the headlines and eclipse what can seem the more humdrum but nevertheless vital issues.As the protocol makes clear, however, the range and detail of the discussions is huge – as well as ensuring free trade in goods, the protocol says it shall also “be implemented and applied so as to maintain the necessary conditions for continued North-South co-operation, including in the areas of environment, health, agriculture, transport, education and tourism, as well as energy, telecommunications, broadcasting, inland fisheries, justice and security, higher education and sport”.Guaranteeing many of these, Irish officials stress, is also dependent on unhindered movement across the Border – the necessity for a Border deal permeates the entire protocol.It also contains provisions to safeguard the Common Travel Area between the Republic of Ireland and the UK, for joint citizenship provisions for Northern Ireland, and to “respect the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent”.It requires the UK to guarantee that there is “no diminution of rights” caused by its departure from the EU, including in the area of protection against forms of discrimination enshrined in EU law.The Irish protocol currently runs to eight pages of the 129-page Withdrawal Agreement, which is now being turned into legal treaty language.The challenge EU leaders have set themselves is to complete broad agreement on the treaty text by June, so that it can be finalised by October and then be put to member states and the European Parliament for ratification ahead of the UK’s departure at the end of March, 2019.The Withdrawal Agreement contains the agreement on transition, or the “implementation period” as the UK calls it, and, like the rest of the text, it stands or falls on agreement on the whole package, including the Irish protocol.The important parallel discussions now under way on the “future relationship” between the EU and UK, essentially the future trading relationship, are also conditional on no “backsliding” on the agreements made in December in the “Joint Report” between the EU and UK which is reflected in the Withdrawal Agreement.Brussels and Dublin are adamant that unless the UK honours its commitment to the “backstop” provision of that December agreement, the future relationship talks will stop and the Withdrawal Agreement and the transition deal will be put in jeopardy.Those talks are set to produce a political outline of a future trading relationship which will be approved with the Withdrawal Agreement, although not having the same legal standing. A trade treaty can be agreed only once the UK is no longer an EU member-state.The Withdrawal Agreement text is colour-coded to reflect different stages of agreement – currently 15 per cent of the protocol is in green, effectively agreed, 37 per cent remains in yellow, on which there is political agreement on objectives but not on drafting, and 47 per cent is white or uncoloured, unagreed. There is much still to do.Most of the protocol white text reflects how the EU sees the operation of the “backstop” arrangement – the Border fallback guarantee should the UK prove unable to come up with and agree with the EU-preferred scenario for preventing a hard border.The Withdrawal Agreement text on safeguarding human rights post-Brexit remains in yellow – the UK is understood to accept in principle that there should be “no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity” in the North. However, the language proposed by the commission remains problematic, and the full enumeration of such rights in the annex to the treaty protocol has yet to be agreed.The range of these rights goes well beyond the issues of discrimination, equality and identity that are traditionally seen as central to the conflict – gender rights legislation, for example, or carers’ rights, or family law arrangements, including custody and maintenance issues, may have their roots in EU legislation.Although most of such regulations will be incorporated automatically into UK law by means of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, campaigners in the North worry over the abandonment by the UK of obligations under the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights.“The EU Charter acts as an important constitutional safeguard underpinning human rights protections in Northern Ireland and its removal weakens the quality and range of human rights protections available here,” the Northern Ireland Human Rights Consortium warns.The EU’s protocol text proposes that “The United Kingdom shall continue to facilitate the related work of the institutions and bodies set up pursuant to the 1998 Agreement, including the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and the Joint Committee of representatives of the Human Rights Commissions of Northern Ireland and Ireland, in upholding human rights and equality standards.”Irish officials are said to be concerned at the lack of specific commitments to ringfence such funding.Other non-Border issues such as UK adherence to EU “state aid” rules – to prevent unfair competition through state subsidies – and the challenge of customs-free “transit” for Irish lorries and goods across the UK to EU markets also remain unagreed.Although not mentioned in the Irish protocol, and in theory an issue for the post-Brexit future relationship talks, because it is an issue of specific concern to Ireland and not other member-states, Irish officials are keen to see the issue taken up in the Irish talks strand.The UK signalled as far back as last August that it is willing to sign up to membership of the Common Transit Convention to facilitate the transit trade in both directions, and there are precedents using seals on lorries. But there are concerns at how the Irish lorries will be able to bypass potentially long customs queues at ports such as Dover. Transit across Northern Ireland will also require maintaining harmonised transport regulations such as recognition of hauliers’ licences.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

The helicopter will have twin, counter-rotating blades which will power through the thin Martian atmosphere at almost 3,000 rpm – about 10 times the rate of a helicopter on Earth.The helicopter has solar cells to charge its lithium-ion batteries, and a heating mechanism to keep it warm through the cold Martian nights.“The altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about 40,000 feet. The atmosphere of Mars is only one per cent that of Earth, so when our helicopter is on the Martian surface, it’s already at the Earth equivalent of 100,000 feet up,” said Mimi Aung, Mars Helicopter project manager.“To make it fly at that low atmospheric density, we had to scrutinize everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be.”Controllers on Earth will command the Mars Helicopter, through a system of commands send from the ground, rather than a real-time joystick.The full 30-day flight test campaign will include up to five flights of incrementally farther flight distances, up to a few hundred meters, and longer durations as long as 90 seconds. On its first flight, the helicopter will make a short vertical climb to 10 feet, where it will hover for about 30 seconds.Please review our commenting policyChina\u0026#39s first home-built aircraft carrier began sea trials as Beijing ramps up its military mightRough sleepers claim thousands in compensation after being detained and deported \u0026#39Family of Isil terrorists\u0026#39 behind Indonesia suicide church attackParis terror attack: Knifeman shot dead by police after killing one and injuring four \u0026#39is Chechen-born\u0026#39Wildlife ranger killed trying to protect kidnapped Britons in DR Congo is namedMeghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover - and breath of fresh air for the British Royal family How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding on TV next weekRoyal wedding schedule and timings for the marriage of Harry and MeghanRoyal wedding 2018: All the details, timings and latest newsITV news anchor Tom Bradby \u0026#39kept away from work for five weeks due to insomnia\u0026#39Rich List: Jim Ratcliffe named as UK\u0026#39s richest man and record number of women among 1,000 wealthiestLate night revelry and phones on lockdown: What really goes on at a royal weddingIsrael celebrates US embassy in Jerusalem as Palestinians brace for bloodshed in GazaThe World War One hero who\u0026#39s laid to rest after a century of being missing in actionPrince Harry most popular Royal worldwide as he is deployed on first tours of married life, poll findsComment: How new EU rules threatenHarry and Meghan to include first female state trumpeter at a Royal Wedding as she stands by her husband\u0026#39s sideDavid Lloyd launches new scheme letting you binge on TV while you runComment: Flat taxes get more money from the richWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"watch prince harry meghan markles royal wedding tv next week","story":"There\u0027s not long to go until Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s royal wedding.

There will be as much tradition and pomp as any drama or history series ever needed. Expect cheering crowds in any weather packing the pavements of Windsor and thousands celebrating in their local communities at street parties across the nation. To make sure you catch every second on TV - including the dizzying spectacle of the FA Cup Final which falls on the same day - read on.  Not long to go... Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on the day they announced their engagementThe Prince and Ms Markle are set to be married on Saturday, 19 May. Clear your diary.The hour-long ceremony will begin at 12:00pm sharp at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, but expect several hours of TV coverage first as the excitement and anticipation builds.The service, conducted by the Dean of Windsor, will end around 1pm when Prince Harry and Ms Markle have taken their vows - officiated by The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby.Yes, you\u0027ll be able to catch all the action from your sofa. The wedding and procession will be televised live on networks around the world. A single pool camera will capture the nuptials so many channels will be able to broadcast it. In the UK, the BBC, Sky News and ITV will cover the day with big-name presenters.The BBC broadcast will be anchored by Huw Edwards, Kirsty Young and Dermot O\u0027Leary from the grounds of Windsor Castle. The cameras will roll from Saturday morning, as Young and O\u0027Leary cover the build-up from the castle\u0027s moat, whilst newsreader Edwards presents from the equally spectacular roof of the Windsor Guard Room.They will be supported by a team of roaming presenters including The One Show\u0027s Alex Jones and former Strictly Come Dancing champion Ore Oduba, who will capture the excitement on the ground. The BBC has announced that a television licence will not be needed to watch the wedding, allowing communities to screen the event at street parties and gatherings.  ITV\u0027s output will be presented by Phillip Schofield and Julie Etchingham, using a purpose-built studio in Windsor, and Sky News will be in Windsor as well, making sure no angle is missed.Live coverage of the ceremony will be broadcast on big screens around the UK, including in Belfast, Salisbury, Leeds, Swansea, Winchester and Portsmouth.It\u0027s highly unlikely that we\u0027ll catch a glimpse of the two wedding receptions. They are private events for guests only. Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, travel to Buckingham Palace, after their wedding ceremony at Westminster Abbey in London, 2011As Harry and Meghan will enter the chapel at 12:00 B.S.T, North American viewers will have an early start if they want to catch the action live.   The first footage will be available from CBS\u0027 This Morning, which airs at 4:00 E.S.T (1:00 PT). NBC takes its entire Today show to Windsor for their coverage beginning at 4:30 E.S.T (1:30 PT), and ABC News and Good Morning America will begin at 5:00 E.S.T (2.00 PT).Meanwhile, BBC America will broadcast a live simulcast of the UK\u0027s BBC One from 4:15 E.S.T (1:15 PT), and HBO begins their live coverage at the more accommodating time of 7:15 E.S.T (4:30 PT). All of these American broadcasters are set to provide online and mobile coverage of the big day,  but ensure you are a paid subscriber to watch BBC America or HBO.Another alternative is to find one of almost 200 cinema screenings across the US for a 10am (local time) screening of ITV\u0027s broadcast, only a few hours after the events unfold in Windsor. Canadian\u0027s can turn to national broadcaster CBC from 4:00 E.S.T (1:00 PT) for live coverage, or opt to follow their live CBC News blog with updates from the goings-on at Windsor. Whist CBC\u0027s World Report radio programme will air from 6:00 E.S.T (3:00 PT) for a special royal wedding breakfast edition.On the opposite side of the globe, New Zealanders can tune-in from 22:30 for TVNZ\u0027s simulcast of BBC One for the ceremony set to begin at 23:00 Wellington-time. The national broadcaster will also show a highlights package the next day, for anyone wanting an early night.     Australian\u0027s have a choice of ABC, Seven, SBS, and Nine for Aussie-led coverage from Windsor, or a BBC One simulcast via Foxtel, all kicking-off between 19:00 and 19:30 AEST.The wedding at Windsor will be streamed straight to online streaming services, news sites, and mobile apps.Head to BBC iPlayer or ITV Hub for a live online broadcast in the UK (with a TV licence), or CBSN Live and ABC News in the US.    Windsor Castle from the airThe FA Cup finalfalls on the same day as the royal wedding. The game between Chelsea and Manchester United will kick-off at 17:15 BST on BBC One, so football-loving royalists can have their cake and eat it. However the BBC\u0027s one-off TV licence dispensation does not apply to the FA Cup final, so find a screen somewhere near to your royal wedding celebrations.    Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, usually attends the final and presents the cup to the winning captain in his role as Football Association president. However, he will miss the event this year to fulfil his role as Prince Harry\u0027s best man.You can expect the wedding to attract a large audience in the UK and abroad. About 27 million Brits and 23 million Americans watched the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011.The BBC\u0027s coverage of William and Kate\u0027s wedding attracted 67.2 per cent of the television audience share that day, attracting 18.7 million viewers to BBC One during the ceremony. More than  a million people used BBC iPlayer to watch the coverage.In 2011, the BBC had faced intense criticism for choosing Huw Edwards to anchor the presenting team rather than more seasoned royal broadcasters such as David Dimbleby.

She inherited her position and stake in the company from her father Freddy Heineken when he died in 2002.She appears on the list alongside her husband, Citigroup banker Michel, 73, with a fortune of £11.1bn, up £1.8bn on last year. Her rise to the title of wealthiest woman in The Sunday Times Rich List has been attributed in part to the successful launch of a new alcohol-free beer.Topping the list this year is British-born industrialist Jim Ratcliffe, whose fortune stands at £21.05bn.Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken, 63, who runs the family Heineken beer businessThe 65-year-old, who is chairman and CEO of Ineos - Britain’s largest privately-owned company - bought a box in the Royal Albert Hall for a record £2.76m last year.Mr Ratcliffe is now worth £21.5bn, up from £15.3bn last year, which The Sunday Times says is mostly due to the newspaper having greater detail about the businessman\u0027s assets, adding £50m for two superyachts, hotel interests in The New Forest and a large property portfolio.Ineos sells more than 60m tons of chemicals annually for use in the packaging, food, construction, textile, white goods, and car manufacturing industries, employing over 18,500 staff.Jim Ratcliffe: the billionaire who wants to arrest Britain\u0026#039s manufacturing declineIneos\u0027s director Andy Currie and finance director John Reece shared in his fortunes, joining Mr Ratcliffe in the top 20, taking joint 16th place with fortunes of £7 billion each.The number of people who inherited their wealth has gone down, with 94 per cent of the rich list being comprised of self-made entrepreneurs.  Financier Ernesto Bertarelli and his wife Kirsty saw the biggest decrease in wealth, losing £1.48 billion due to falls in Ernesto\u0027s pharmaceutical company stakes, the list\u0027s author said.Among others whose fortunes have declined is Jamie Oliver, who no longer appears on the list, having closed a number of restaurants in the past year.Jamie Oliver is no longer on the listArcadia boss Sir Philip Green’s fortune has also dropped in wake of the collapse of BHS and a row over its pension schemes after he sold the business for just a £1 to a man twice declared bankrupt.Falling sales at his flagship brands Topshop and Miss Selfridge as well as his promise to contribute £363 million towards the pension deficit led to Sir Philip\u0027s fortune dropping by £787 million to £2 billion.At second place in the list were the Hinduja brothers, Sri and Gopi, worth £20.64 billion. Their fortune jumped by £4.44 billion on 2017, with their India-based car manufacturer Ashok Leyland and Mumbai-based IndusInd Bank having a particularly successful year.British-American industrialist-turned-media mogul Sir Len Blavatnik came in third place with £15.26 billion to his name.Jim Ratcliffe was at 18 on the list last year, but the compilers said this was down to the success of Ineos and the availibility of further detail on the business. Some of his wealth is in the form of two superyachts, hotel interests in The New Forest and a property portfolio.Mr Ratcliffe made his money in the chemicals industry as the founder of Ineos Group. He remains its chief executive  majority owner. His firm is currently locked in a legal battle with the Scottish government over its moratorium on fracking. The Hinduja brothers were first last yearThe Hinduja brothers have dropped one place after topping the list last year. But their fortune still jumped by £4.44 billion on 2017, with their India-based car manufacturer Ashok Leyland and Mumbai-based IndusInd Bank having a particularly successful year.The Hinduja group has investments in oil and gas, IT, energy, media, banking, property and healthcare.Sir Len Blavatnik, 60, was knighted this year for services to philanthropy. His recent donations include £50 million to fund the Tate Modern\u0027s new wing, and £5 million towards the Victoria and Albert Museum\u0027s new entrance, as well as funding the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University.He was second in the list last year. Sir Len made his money when he sold his stake in Russian oil company TNK-BP and as owner of Warner Music, as well as through investments. Simon (L) and David Reuben are brothersDropping one place form last year, brothers David and Simon Reuben made their money from property, metals and online business. They were born in Mumbai and raised in Britain. Lakshmi Mittal is chairman of ArcelorMittalAlso down one place is the steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal. He is chairman and CEO of the world\u0027s largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal. He was born in India and lives in London.The highest-placed woman on the list, Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken, and her husband Michel owe their fortunte to the Heineken beer dynasty.They have gone up the list, from 10th place last year.Granddaughter of the founder of Tetra Pak, Kirsten Rausing and brother Jorn own packaging company TetraLaval. They were in eighth position on 2017\u0027s rich list.Alisher Usmanov made his money in mining and investment. He has a stake in iron ore and steel giant Metalloinvest. He drops three places from fifth last year.The Irish-Canadian Weston family owe their fortune to the food and retail industry. They run supermarkets in Canada and also own a number of shops including department store Selfridges. The family were seventh in last year\u0027s list. Hugh Grosvenor, 27, is the country\u0027s youngest billionaire. He inherited the title of 7th Duke of Westminster when his father died two years ago. The family have a property empire including 300 acres in Mayfair and Belgravia. The family move down one place from 9th last year. China\u0026#39s first home-built aircraft carrier began sea trials as Beijing ramps up its military mightRough sleepers claim thousands in compensation after being detained and deported \u0026#39Family of Isil terrorists\u0026#39 behind Indonesia suicide church attackParis terror attack: Knifeman shot dead by police after killing one and injuring four \u0026#39is Chechen-born\u0026#39Wildlife ranger killed trying to protect kidnapped Britons in DR Congo is namedMeghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover -

But everyone is in the dark as the powers-that-be have kept it hush-hush.An ITV News spokesperson said: “Tom’s off sick at the moment. Until his return, regular News at Ten presenters Julie Etchingham and Rageh Omaar will anchor the programme.”The news anchor was last seen in public at a charity lunch in London on March 6.He is understood to be recuperating in the £1m Hampshire home he shares with his wife Claudia, a jewellery designer.He is friendly with the Princes from his time as a Royal correspondent.In 2010 William chose Bradby to conduct his engagement interview and invited him to the wedding the following year.

However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm.The core aspects of the wedding, including the church service, associated music, flowers, decorations and reception, will be paid for by the Royal Family, with Ms Markle’s parents both set to attend.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesFormer Suits star Ms Markle told last year how she could not wait to say yes to the prince when Harry got down on one knee as they cooked a roast chicken dinner at his home, Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace.Indicating the depths of his feeling for his bride-to-be, the prince revealed in a television interview: It was this beautiful woman just sort of literally tripped and fell into my life, I fell into her life.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, Windsor. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Royal sources said the guest list will be restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, and was taken both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small, and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.As well a dress code, the Royal guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day. The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.They further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Read more about who they are here.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayOther guests will include members of Ms Markle\u0027s family - her mother Doria Radlan and father Thomas Markle Snr - and of course many members of the royal family.Tennis star Serena Williams and Ms Markle\u0027s former Suits co-stars Sarah Rafferty, Patrick J Adams and Wendell Pierce could also be on the list.The invitations were produced by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood, which has held the Royal Warrant for Printing \u0026amp Bookbinding by Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen since 1985.Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales. They also reveal that the dress code is Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit, or Day Dress with Hat.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsThe Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince George and Princess Charlotte look almost certain to be page boy and flower girl. The siblings already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Kensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016Friends including Jessica Mulroney, Misha Noo Lindsay Roth, Benita Litt, Janina Gavankar and Priyanka Chopra are expected to be seen as part of the congregation.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be making their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999.  The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. They will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.Harry also has to decide whether to wear a wedding ring. William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a “special place” during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will then undertake a two mile tour of Windsor greeting well-wishers. They will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for their reception.Read more about the procession here.Following the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Scant details have emerged about the receptions so far, but we do know that the couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake.Kensington Palace said Ms Ptak, owner of the Violet Bakery in Hackney, will create a cake for the Royal wedding incorporating the bright flavours of spring. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonIt is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.The couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.Peonies are one of Ms Markle\u0027s favourite flowers, so it is likely her floral bouquet will include these fragrant blooms, which are in season in May.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father Thomas Markle choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, is expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle, but may not make a formal speech.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Radlan at the Invictus GamesIn February, one of the five original Spice Girls Mel B hinted that the Spice Girls were expected to reunite for the Royal wedding. The singer, known to fans as Scary Spice, claimed she had received a proper invitation during an appearance on a television chat show.Fellow Spice Girl Victoria Beckham also appeared to let slip she was attending the big day during an appearance on The Late, Late Show with James Corden earlier in April. Asked if she would be among the guests, she said: I, uh, I, I don\u0027t know...However, it has recently been reported that the Spice Girls have no plans to perform at the wedding, and have not been rehearsing for the event.Victoria and her husband David were invited to the 2011 royal wedding. Prince Harry with the Spice Girls in 1997Ms Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday declared.Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers plan to extend licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on the nights of Friday 18 and Saturday 19 May - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.

The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleChina\u0026#39s first home-built aircraft carrier began sea trials as Beijing ramps up its military mightRough sleepers claim thousands in compensation after being detained and deported \u0026#39Family of Isil terrorists\u0026#39 behind Indonesia suicide church attackParis terror attack: Knifeman shot dead by police after killing one and injuring four \u0026#39is Chechen-born\u0026#39Wildlife ranger killed trying to protect kidnapped Britons in DR Congo is namedMeghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover - and breath of fresh air for the British Royal family How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding on TV next weekRoyal wedding schedule and timings for the marriage of Harry and MeghanITV news anchor Tom Bradby \u0026#39kept away from work for five weeks due to insomnia\u0026#39Rich List: Jim Ratcliffe named as UK\u0026#39s richest man and record number of women among 1,000 wealthiestLate night revelry and phones on lockdown: What really goes on at a royal weddingIsrael celebrates US embassy in Jerusalem as Palestinians brace for bloodshed in GazaThe World War One hero who\u0026#39s laid to rest after a century of being missing in actionPrince Harry most popular Royal worldwide as he is deployed on first tours of married life, poll findsComment: How new EU rules threatenHarry and Meghan to include first female state trumpeter at a Royal Wedding as she stands by her husband\u0026#39s sideDavid Lloyd launches new scheme letting you binge on TV while you runComment: Flat taxes get more money from the richComment: Our politicians are going round in circles over future customs arrangements - and time is running outWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding schedule timings marriage harry meghan","story":"The Royal wedding of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry is now just over a week away, which means the final preparations for the big day will no doubt be being tweaked and polished as you read. The ceremony, which takes place on Saturday May 19, will be held in Windsor it will include two wedding receptions and a carriage procession, as well as the service.Prince Harry and Ms Markle have broken tradition by choosing to hold their wedding on a Saturday, as royal weddings usually take place during the week. The wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge was held on a Friday and the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales was held on a Wednesday on both occasions the public were given an extra bank holiday.While Downing Street have said there are no plans to give Britons a day off for this year\u0027s royal nuptials, pubs and bars will be allowed to stay open until 1am on Friday May 18 and the day of the wedding itself.Amber Rudd, the former Home Secretary, opened a consultation on the plans in January. She said: “The Royal wedding will be a time of national celebration, and we want everyone to be able to make the most of such an historic occasion.“I hope that this relaxation of the licensing hours will allow people to extend their festivities and come together to mark what will be a very special moment for the country.”Here is everything you need to know about how the big day will unfold.WATCH:  How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingThe service will take place at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999 plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.Members of the public who have been invited to watch from the grounds of Windsor Castle will  begin to arrive from 9am.Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach. Two driving routes have been suggested, with guests required to meet at the Windsor Farm Shop – founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce.There, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification they will then be ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle\u0027s Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door.Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.At 11:20am, members of the Royal Family will arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car from the Royal Mews, including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers.A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding servicePrince Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:45am. It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeMeghan\u0027s father will meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door, before walking her down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd.

If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George\u0027s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions. This will be hosted by the Queen, will take place during the afternoon and will be attended by all guests who were invited to the service.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests royal sources have said the guest list has been restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at Frogmore HouseFrom 7pm, a select 200 close friends will attend an after party hosted by the Prince of Wales at Frogmore House, Windsor. Half a mile away from Windsor Castle, the 17th century Grade I country house is owned by the Crown Estate and is part of the Frogmore Estate on the ground of the Home Park.Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u0027s engagement photos were taken in the grounds of Frogmore House.

The series follows Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s.It’s perhaps the archetypal image of the cult we’ve come to recognise: the followers of Rajneesh, who died in 1990, dressed in orange their leader was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities) the disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead, lost contact with their families.But cults don’t have to follow the pattern of Rajneeshpuram, as the Oregon ranch was renamed, or the bloodbaths at Jonestown or Waco, where David Koresh’s sect the Branch Davidians was raided by the FBI in 1993. More often than not, they are more mundane than that… but no less damaging.Rajneesh, also known as Osho, with his ‘Orange People’ followers (Netflix)Katy Morgan-Davies last month published a book about her experiences living in Brixton with the cult leader – and her father – Aravindan Balakrishnan, who was jailed on charges of rape and imprisonment in 2015. Morgan-Davies managed to flee the cult in 2013 after 30 years – her entire life.Cults are back in the news again, but for Ian Haworth they never went away. As the head of the UK-based Cult Information Centre, he spends his life collating information on cults, offering advice and help to those who have escaped – or wish to – and campaigns for stricter legislation to control the reach and influence of these malign groups.“I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults,” says Haworth. “That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thing.”Katy Morgan-Davies, 33, formerly known as Rosie Davies, who was kept as a prisoner by her father Aravindan Balakrishnan (PA)That interest comes in peaks and troughs, naturally, with particular focus at the moment thanks to Wild Wild Country and Morgan-Davies’ memoir. Haworth says: “I suppose the biggest peak we’ve had began on 1 January 1999, when there was a huge amount of cult activity related to the millennium, when all kinds of things were promised or predicted. Of course, mathematically, the millennium ended at the end of the year 2000, not the end of 1999, but cult leaders don’t really care about such things. They care about money, and controlling people, and power.”Born in Lancashire, the son of a farmer, Haworth emigrated to Canada in 1972 while in his twenties. By 1978 he was working as a communications consultant for a large company, and had never given a thought to cults. Aged 31, he happened to be stopped by a woman with a clipboard in a Toronto street.After fleeing a cult in 1978, Ian Haworth has dedicated his life to helping others in the same situation (Cult Information Centre)“She was very attractive and I was very single,” remembers Haworth. “When she asked me if I had time to answer a few questions for what I thought was market research, I said yes.”But after only half a dozen questions, the tone of the exchange altered. The woman told Haworth that his answers indicated he’d fit in very well with a group she was involved with, and that it would enable him to give something back to society rather than just taking. A meeting was taking place the following week and Haworth was invited along.“I turned up and there were about a hundred people there,” he says. “A woman was talking about her addiction to alcohol and drugs, and how this group had helped her. I was planning to sneak away at the end, because I’d been brought up to be polite and didn’t want to just walk out. Then they brought out drinks and cakes, and as I’d paid $2 (£1.50) to attend I decided I might as well get my money’s worth before leaving.”The world of Cults: in picturesThe world of Cults: in picturesAravindan Balakrishnan, known as ‘Comrade Bala’ within the women-only collective he founded 40 years ago, carried out a brutal campaign of sexual degradation against the women over several decades.

Aravindan Balakrishnan was jailed for 23 years in 2016. To keep his devotees in check, Balakrishnan invented \u0027Jackie\u0027, which he said could kill or trigger earthquakes if anyone went against his will. He claimed that a challenge to his leadership resulted in the 1986 space shuttle disaster and Jackie, an invisible war machine, was responsible for the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour party leader. PAwords by Hardeep Matharu Jim Jones, founder of the Peoples Temple sect in Jonestown, north Guyana, in 1978. Believers of the Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ followed Reverend Jones to Guyana in the Seventies, hoping to create a utopia in the jungle. Jonestown was envisaged as a “rainbow family” of all ages and races, the preacher had promised them: “Divine principles. Total equality. A society where people own all things in common, where there is no rich or poor, where there are no races.” APwords by Adam LusherReverend Jones wanted to create a glorious sacrifice, a defiant act of “revolutionary suicide” that would echo through history. Some disciples willingly colluded, cheering as he exhorted them to kill themselves and their children. But the bodies found with bent needles in their arms testified to the fact that some refused and were forcibly injected. Rexwords by Adam LusherWhen they finally counted the bodies after what would become known as the Jonestown massacre of 18 November 1978, the total came to 918, of whom 304 were children. They had been persuaded to “drink the Kool-Aid”, Flavor Aid, used to mask the bitter taste of cyanide, mixed with a dash of Valium.APwords by Adam LusherMaude Julien, now 60, was forced to hold onto an electric fence for without showing feeling as a child. The ritual was considered to be a test of her willpower by her father, who wanted to make her “superhuman”.\u0026#13Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which was built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s. Rajneesh, who died in 1990, was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities). His disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead and lost contact with their families.During a break he went into the corridor for a cigarette, and that’s when the cult members pounced. Haworth had seen his doctor not long before and been told if he carried on smoking like he did he’d be lucky to see 40. The group told him that they would absolutely guarantee he would stop smoking if he attended a further course for $220. He’d already looked into smoking-cessation courses that were of comparable cost, so decided he’d give this one a go.“The course took place in September, 1978,” says Haworth. “By the end of the course I’d given notice at my job, promised to dedicate my life to the cult, and handed over all my savings, which amounted to about $1,500.”Jonestown commune mass suicide in 1978 (AP)Even now, Haworth cannot identify the tipping point that turned him from someone who’d turned up for a meeting at the behest of an attractive woman to someone who gave himself, body and soul, to a cult, other than mid-way through the course when he stopped smoking. “I suppose that was the moment I went over to them – they had done what they said they would do.”Cults often thrive on feeding into people’s desires. Sometimes they will promise success, artistic or creative talent, fulfil a desire in their targets to effect social change or, as with Haworth, to “give something back” to the world. They will promise freedom from addictions or improved physical or mental health. They’re what Haworth calls therapy cults, as opposed to the religious cults that offer more spiritual promises.If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had. You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situationOver the next month, Haworth tried to recruit his friends and even neighbours to the group. They were appalled at the change in him, but, he says, “I thought they were wrong, I knew they weren’t part of the elite, like I was.”It was an almost textbook recruitment, and Haworth firmly believes he would have been lost to everyone who knew him but for one error on the part of the cult. “Most cults programme their members against the media very early on. These people didn’t do that,” he says. And that was what saved him.A neighbour gave him a copy of the Toronto Star which had featured a front-page exposé of the group Haworth was involved in, written by the investigative reporter Sidney Katz. Haworth read the piece and contacted Katz immediately to verify his facts. He then, as he describes it, “fell apart at the seams”. Having seen Katz’s research and evidence first hand, at the invitation of the journalist, Haworth angrily confronted the cult’s leaders, and they effectively banished him. He was finally free of them.“That was in October,” he says. “Then, in the November, everything came out about the Jonestown cult. And I knew that could have been me. It took me 11 months to fully recover and get back to myself.”NXIVM (which calls itself a ‘multi-level marketing organisation’) member Allison Mack leaving US District Court after her bail hearing in Brooklyn (Getty)It took that long for the nagging whispers of “Cult Ian”, as Haworth describes the person he was when he was with the group, to be finally silenced, and for “Real Ian” to reassert himself. And good sense would dictate that was the point he turned his back on cults forever and got on with his life.“I come from a farming background in Lancashire,” says Haworth. “People used to say, ‘If there’s summat up, then tha’ does summat about it’. So I did summat about it.”Sidney Katz put Haworth in touch with a TV producer called Peter Scott and together they set up what was first called the Council for Mind Abuse, and which later metamorphosed into the Cult Information Centre in 1987, now run as a charity.I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults. That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thingHaworth and Scott concentrated on the group he had been involved with, even handing out flyers to a party of new recruits flown into Canada, exhorting them to go back to the airport. Faced with Haworth’s evidence, many of them did. Eventually, the resistance proved too much for the group. “Toronto wasn’t big enough for the both of us,” he smiles. “They got out.”Haworth doesn’t know where they are now, or if they still exist. Cults change their names often, to keep one step ahead of the media or inquisitive minds, and to muddy the paper trail they leave behind. Besides, he soon had more than enough on his plate as more and more people began to get in touch, especially after he had relocated back to the UK.One of the Cult Information Centre’s primary roles is working with ex-cult members. He likens the trauma that recovering cult followers go through to PTSD, and says systems to deal with and help them are variable, if present at all.He would also like to see stronger laws to deal with cults there’s no specific legislation surrounding them, and it’s only when cult leaders are discovered to have committed actual crimes, such as Aravindan Balakrishnan in 2015, that the law can act.Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh surrounded by devotees (Netflix)The Aravindan Balakrishnan case, and the revelations of Katy Morgan-Davies in her new book, add an extra dimension to Haworth’s work. It’s one thing to try to help cult members who have managed to break free return to their old, pre-cult lives, but what of those born into cults?“If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had,” says Haworth. “You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situation.”And don’t think it is only stupid people who would fall for a cult. Experts say that cults are most likely to be attractive to intelligent, well-educated people… they have flexible minds can consider and be seduced by the alternative lifestyles offered by cults.Documentary about alleged sex cult NXIVM being producedSmallville actor allegedly tried to recruit Emma Watson to ‘sex cult’Waco: what really happened when David Koresh’s cult faced the FBI?From Jonestown in the Seventies to Rajneeshpuram in the 1980s to Brixton in the 2000s: cults endure, and spring up all across the world. Nothing about modern life and its complexities has inured us against the attractions of a charismatic guru or cult leader.“They start off wanting the usual things,” says Haworth. “Money, sex, power over people. Then, after perhaps about 10 years, they start to believe the things they say, they maybe start to believe they are gods.”And as long as the false gods continue to prey on the innocent, Ian Haworth will continue his 40-years-and-counting battle against the scourge of the cults.For more information on Haworth’s work at the Cult Information Centre go to cultinformation.org.ukor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June.

Scientists want to test how “heavier-than-air vehicles” will operate on the red planet, Nasa said in a release. “The idea of a helicopter flying the skies of another planet is thrilling. The Mars Helicopter holds much promise for our future science, discovery and exploration missions to Mars.” Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said about the drone-like machine. What fake Mars colony Biosphere 2 looks like today “After the Wright brothers proved 117 years ago that powered, sustained and controlled flight was possible here on Earth, another group of American pioneers may prove the same can be done on another world,” Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for Nasa’s Science Mission Directorate, said at the agency headquarters in Washington.The Mars Helicopter will not be manned but operated autonomously similar to how a drone is here on Earth. It has the potential to be much faster – and more complicated to pull off – than travelling the rocky and dirt-covered surface of Mars. However, unlike a drone “we don’t have a pilot and Earth will be several light minutes away, so there is no way to joystick this mission in real time,” MiMi Aung, project manager at the agency’s Jet Propulsion Lab, said. Instead, the helicopter will be able to receive a set of commands for flying a mission and carry them out on its own, Ms Aung explained. Nasa\u0027s canny decision to commission sumptuous vintage-inspired posters by Seattle design firm Invisible Creature has firmly placed space travel back where it belongs: in the imagination of travellersIt is particularly fitting that the Nasa commission went to Don and Ryan Clark, who have been running Invisible Creature since 2006, undertaking projects for the likes of Nike and TargetWe were ecstatic, just because our grandfather was an illustrator at Nasa for 30 years, says ClarkThe artwork harks back to the Jet Age-era posters commissioned by Howard Hughes\u0027 Trans World Airlines and its rival United in the 1950s and 1960s, when the work of David Klein (for TWA) and Stan Galli (for United) glamorised and essentially branded this new age of air travelIt doesn\u0027t matter that Nasa has no plans for a Grand Tour of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and UranusIf global travel is for daydreamers, going beyond the atmosphere is for true space cadetsOne of the main challenges is that helicopters here on Earth have only reached an altitude of 40,000 feet (12,192 metres), but Mars’s atmosphere is 1 per cent that of Earth’s. This means that when the new helicopter is on the surface of the planet, it will already be the equivalent of 100,000 feet up in the Earth’s atmosphere. “To make it fly at that low atmospheric density, we had to scrutinise everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be,” Ms Aung said. Nasa lander to dig into the Mars surface to answer deepest mysteriesNasa and ESA to bring soil from Mars to try and find aliensMission to Mars will launch within a decade, says SpaceX president“Nasa has a proud history of firsts,” Mr Bridenstine said. According to Nasa, “the full 30-day flight test campaign will include up to five flights of incrementally farther flight distances, up to a few hundred metres, and longer durations as long as 90 seconds, over a period. On its first flight, the helicopter will make a short vertical climb to 10 feet (3 metres), where it will hover for about 30 seconds”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That is precisely what we will do.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Zero class despite their toff parents spending ludicrous amounts on their ‘education’.”Another said: “It’s 2018 and not much has changed! Not only did @oratoryschool allow students to do blackface, they have completely ignored the issue.”A third called for the boys to be expelled.the guy made twitter to message me and say that because he finds it “funny” that i should too?? tell me what’s “humorous” about slavery and black face??? i’m intrigued.A spokesperson for the school said in response to complaints: It has been brought to our attention that a photo was recently posted on social media of a small number of pupils from our school while dressed in an offensive manner.The headmaster and senior staff were present for the photo and refused to allow the offensively dressed pupils to participate and the photo was taken without them being included.The photo – the existence of which we were unaware – that was taken and posted on social media was taken unofficially and was in no way with the consent or blessing of the school.The statement said school chiefs were extremely shocked and saddened that it had happened and apologised unreservedly for the offence caused.We are dealing with this matter internally, it added.The Oratory School unequivocally condemns racist imagery of any sort.We will strengthen our tutorial programme to ensure that it is understood by all our pupils that such representations are utterly unacceptable.In 2014, a former housemistress at the school told a tribunal a pupil stoned wild birds, skinned live cats and humiliated younger boys.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Fishing accounts for 41 per cent of the islands’ economy and two-thirds of the corporation tax received by its treasury. UK threatens less EU security cooperation if locked out of GalileoAny negative impact from Brexit on the islands’ economy is likely to be a thorny issue for Brexiteers, for many of whom the Falklands is a touchstone issue.Speaking after recent trips to Brussels and London the chair of the islands’ eight-person legislative assembly told The Independent that potential disruption caused by exit from the single market “would put at risk the current profitability of our fishing industry and would impact both the wider economy and government revenue”.The Falkland Islands government also says “any material change that results in less beneficial importexport access could be potentially catastrophic for the Falkland Islands economy and people”, according to a report drawn up by the UK Overseas Territories Association.The British government says it has “prioritised securing the freest and most frictionless trade possible with the EU”, although in fact it has pledged to leave the single market and customs union.Any material change that results in less beneficial importexport access could be potentially catastrophic for the Falkland Islands economyThe islands mostly export loligo squid to Spain, a seafood that accounts for 89 per cent of their exports to the EU. The Falklands provided over a third of the loligo squid imported by Spain last year once it arrives in the port of Vigo it enters the EU supply chain and is distributed around the world.Representatives of the islands’ fishing industry believe that the “worst case scenario” of having to trade on World Trade Organisation rules as advocated by some Brexiteers would cause a £9m hit to revenues because of tariffs – a large sum for the 3,400-population archipelago that would amount to more than £2,600 per person.The islands’ fishing association says cultivating other markets for squid would be “difficult”, especially in Asia, where “demand is highest but competition is strong, and both political and tariff barriers exist”. In the event of a “no deal” Brexit the islanders say they would be left with no choice but to seek support from the British state to prop up their fishing industry.Theresa May has pledged to leave the single market, stating that remaining in it would be incompatible with properly leaving the EU. The British government hopes to secure tariff- and quota-free access to EU markets for fish and seafood through a free trade agreement – but Seafish, a non-departmental public body that supports the British fishing industry, says Brexit has caused “considerable levels of uncertainty” for the sector.While not technically a member of the single market the Falkland Islands currently enjoys preferential access as a result of its status as a self-governing UK overseas territory and Britain’s membership. It pays no tariffs and is exempt from quotas.Teslyn Barkman, one of the eight elected members of the Falkland Islands’ legislative assembly told The Independent: “We have worked hard over many years to establish and grow our fishing industry – it really is a Falkland Islands success story, and one that has allowed us to stand on our own two feet financially.“As a result of our current tariff- and quota-free access to the EU single market, our fishing companies have been able to develop strong markets across Europe for our premium loligo squid, which is our primary export.  Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Just as we seem set on leaving the EU, we start advising others to join. Government policy would not look out of place in the theatre of the absurd.”Mr Brake said of foreign secretary Boris Johnson: “This just shows how incompetent Boris is. I wouldn’t let him run a bath, let alone the Foreign Office.”Countdown to Brexit: What is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?The government says the London summit will focus on “facilitating political cooperation” in the region, “strengthening regional security cooperation” and “increasing economic stability with a view to improving the business environment”.The London meeting will follow a summit in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia scheduled for Thursday in which EU leaders, including Theresa May, discuss the future of the region. European Council president Donald Tusk said that meeting would “aim to strengthen connections both with and within the region” and “boost cooperation in areas of mutual interest, including security and migration”.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

But I have also said that the virtue, in excess, fills graveyards.“In this case, not continuing in the EEA would mean endangering – sacrificing – thousands of skilled and decently paid jobs and, with them, the life chances of countless families and communities.”May has found another way to stall making a decision on BrexitThis is the truth about the politics behind EurovisionWill Sainsbury’s-Asda sell 73 stores or more than 200? We can’t let the Home Office threaten migrants’ right to strikePolice look at evidence Brexit campaign chief committed crimesEarlier this week Mr Corbyn’s office reiterated arguments previously set out by the leader that remaining in the single market as it stands would hamper his interventionist industrial agenda if he won power.In particular, Mr Corbyn has concerns about what he sees as restrictive state aid rules and regulations that might interfere with his plans to reverse the privatization of public services.But Lord Kinnock rubbished the claims as being “based on falsehood”, adding: “Neither the EEA nor the EU are part of the socialist superstate of neocon delusion, or of the global capitalist adventure playground of infantile leftist illusion.“The EEA is a mixed-economy agreement of 31 democracies ‘to promote continuous and balanced strengthening of trade and economic relations between the contracting parties with equal conditions of competition and the respect of the same rules’.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Many posed to take photos with the “creature”.Though authorities suspect the carcass is simply the decomposed body of a whale, local people expressed their shock at the arrival of such an unusual object.Bizarre deep-sea creatures wash up on Scottish beachResident Tam Maling said: \u0027\u0027An earthquake is heading for Oriental Mindoro. The big globster is a sign of something bad coming. Please pray for us.\u0027\u0027 Vincent Dela Pena Badillo added: \u0027\u0027Many were alarmed including me when we learned the news about it. “It has been told that when creatures from the deepest parts of the ocean start appearing, something bad will happen.\u0027\u0027The \u0027hairy\u0027 appearance of the \u0027creature\u0027 is likely the result of decomposing muscle fibres (ViralPress)Mother-of-two Imelda Mariz took her children to see the carcass, which they thought belonged to a “dead monster”.“I couldn\u0027t believe what it was, I\u0027ve never seen anything like it,” she said.The object is not the first globster – a term used to describe an unidentified organic mass that washed up on a beach – to appear in the Philippines.In February 2017 another mysterious “hairy” blob washed up on the shore of Dinagat Island, prompting speculation about its origins.Thought to belong to either a sea cow or a whale, experts concluded that the “hairs” covering the mystery carcass’s body were in reality the muscle fibres of a body in the very advanced stages of decomposition.Government workers from the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in the Mimapora Region have said they believe the new specimen could also be the carcass of a dead whale. They now intend to dispose of the remains.Fishery Law Enforcement Officer Vox Krusada said: \u0027\u0027Today we just gathered a samples of it for further analysis.\u0027\u0027For now we can say its a whale, but the exact species is still unknown. The tissue samples are now sent to our lab for DNA analysis.Residents flock to see the \u0027globster\u0027 sea creature in Oriental Mindoro province, Philippines, (ViralPress)\u0027\u0027The local government of Gloria will now bury the carcass. And damn it smells awful. It smells like something from another planet. \u0027\u0027I really experienced the full power of its smell because I’m the one who took the tissue samples. I almost puked. I felt better after taking a bath but the stench still lingers in my nose.\u0027\u0027Globsters have been found on beaches all over the world, with the term first used to describe an unidentified carcass that washed up in western Tasmania in 1960.Though it is often difficult for observers to establish the provenance of these marine enigmas, scientific analysis has invariably revealed they belonged to known underwater creatures including sperm whales and basking sharks.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In many parts of the world, glaciers have been in retreat, creating dangerously large lakes that can cause devastating flooding when the banks break. Climate change can also increase rainfall in some areas, while bringing drought to others.Smoke – filled with the carbon that is driving climate change – drifts across a field in Colombia.A river once flowed along the depression in the dry earth of this part of Bangladesh, but it has disappeared amid rising temperatures.

The World Health Organisation has warned such pollution, much of which is from the fossil fuels that cause climate change, is a “public health emergency”.Water levels in reservoirs, like this one in Gers, France, have been getting perilously low in areas across the world affected by drought, forcing authorities to introduce water restrictions.Mr Van Gendt presented new figures about the Tesla battery’s performance, which also revealed it has now taken over 55 per cent of FCAS in the region.South Australia is now reportedly the only state that has experienced a decline in FCAS costs in recent months.Some estimates suggest the cost savings to consumers as a result of this decline have been up to A$35m (£19.5m) in the first four months of the Tesla battery’s operation.Lara Olsen, Tesla Energy’s regional manager of business development, also spoke at the event and explained that while other FCAS systems rely on volatile fuel costs, the wind power the battery relies on is fixed at a cheap and stable price.While local politicians in South Australia largely welcomed the giant battery as a key component in efforts to make the state more self-sufficient and provide affordable energy, there has been push back from the higher levels of government.Australian resources minister Matt Canavan even compared it to Kim Kardashian, stating that “it’s famous for being famous. It really doesn’t do very much.”Tesla’s new mega-battery in Australia responding in ‘record’ timeHowever, the success of the project has been recognised by the Australian Energy Market Operator, which has noted that it is capable of responding to outages much faster than conventional generators.South Australia has been hailed for the lead it has taken on renewable energy, with state Labour politicians lending their support to large scale developments including the world’s largest solar thermal plant. The Tesla battery is seen by experts as another jewel in the state’s green energy crown. To some extent the system’s efficiency has not been a positive thing for Tesla, which has stated that the speed of the battery is not being accounted for properly, resulting in the company missing out on payments.Nevertheless, its success has led to interest in further Tesla projects, with a solar-powered version set to be built in the Australian state of Victoria.While the Hornsdale Power Reserve battery currently holds the title of the world’s largest, Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently hinted at an even larger project set to be announced soon.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She spoke little English, had only met her groom in the days before the wedding, and was only 17 years old.When she walked down the aisle at the Royal Chapel the nerves finally got the better of her - in explosive fashion.Augusta vomited all over her own dress - as well as the dress of her new mother-in-law Caroline of Ansbach, the Queen Consort, who was not best pleased.Nonetheless, the ceremony carried on and the marriage went through, albeit with some of the romance taken out of the situation.The day Lady Diana Spencer became Diana, Princess of Wales was the wedding of the century.

Scott might be 26 years her junior but he always strikes me as the “older” one in the relationship.It’s that sheer zest for life that Barbara has, even at 80, that makes this diagnosis so very sad and hard to bear.Scott decided to speak out because he felt he could no longer protect his beloved wife from people outside their close circle of friends and family hearing the truth.He became worried her illness would make her do or say something out of ­character that could upset her and others.He wants to be able to take his wife on ­ outings, and for her to still meet the public who love her and who will now ­hopefully understand if she’s having a “foggy” day.Scott also needs to make sure he takes care of himself and doesn’t get completely worn out looking after his wife.He hasn’t been able to leave her alone in the house recently, but now the truth is out he can let others take over while he at least has half an hour to himself.Anyone who cares for someone with dementia knows it is utterly exhausting, stressful and worrying, no matter how much you love them.I salute everyone who quietly and patiently deals with these day-to-day ­struggles. Scott is now free of the burden of keeping the secret and I hope he is finding strength from all of the messages of support for Barbara.She’s been part of many of our most-loved shows and we’ve grown up with “Our Babs”.I remember watching her wiggle and giggle her way through the Carry On films, where her sheer talent and perfect comic timing marked her out as a little superstar.Who could forget her enthusiastic arm flinging exercise routine in Carry On Camping that ended with her bra pinging off?And that incredible bikini made up of three shiny red hearts in Carry On Again Doctor made my pal Dr Hilary Jones decide to take up a career in medicine.As she more than proved during her reign in EastEnders, Barbara has always been so much more than a bubbly blonde dolly bird.She is one hell of an actress and was in her element behind the bar of The Queen Vic.It was her and Scott’s decision to kill off Peggy Mitchell when her memory began to fade.Barbara was having difficulty ­learning lines so felt she couldn’t give her very best performance.As it so happens, the scenes leading up to her character’s death were some of the best that ­Barbara, or any soap actress, has ever given on the small screen. Quite simply she is the real deal.I’ve been lucky enough to ­interview her many times over the years and it’s like catching up with an old friend.She’s open and honest and has never tried to cover up her ­mistakes or to sugar-coat the ups and downs of her life.When work was thin on the ground she painted on a smile, climbed into her shiny fairy godmother outfit and worked her backside off in provincial pantos.She was always quick to credit EastEnders for giving her a career comeback.I’ve seen her talking to fans outside the ­studio, always happy to pose for pictures, sign autographs and have a chat.She would leave everyone with a smile on their face and some happy memories.Her own powers of recall and her very bright light may be diminishing, but Scott and all her friends and family, and the public who adore her, will ensure she is wrapped in a soft blanket of love.She’s a class act and a very special woman.TAKE a bow Shayne Ward and all concerned with the deeply moving and hugely important storyline of Aidan’s suicide in Coronation Street.The subject was handled with great sensitivity.We saw Aidan feeling isolated and alone in the crowded Rovers, witnessed his fearful despair and heard his father’s anguished screams of grief through the closed bedroom door.There was no need to see his cold, dead body to understand what had happened. This really was Corrie at its finest.Richard Hawley as devastated dad Johnny and Catherine Tyldesley as poor bereaved Eva were exceptional, but what made me really blub was the authentic speech by Gail (Helen Worth) looking out of her window on to the iconic cobbled street, talking about how we all need to look after each other and that no one should suffer in silence.It was beautifully written and impeccably delivered.That’s what Corrie is all about.IT’S the one time of the year when our inevitable failure to win a massive trophy in Europe is a source of fun and amusement rather than humiliation. Because tonight is Eurovision.Our plucky Brit doomed to failure this time is SuRie, above, who is actually a good performer with a perfectly acceptable song, but even if the UK entry was Robbie Williams belting out Angels, we would still be near the bottom of the table or even doomed to the dreaded “nul points”.Many theories are put forward for our dire results over the past two decades.Some believe there are too many countries taking part (Australia and Israel are bizarrely considered part of Europe) which makes for more tactical voting, combined with an anti- British backlash made worse by Brexit.I reckon it’s simply because we don’t take it seriously enough, for which I’m very grateful, because I truly love Eurovision.We know we won’t win so it’s just an excuse for a party, a chance to wallow in the whole wonderful campfest and to chortle at Graham Norton’s snarky comments.My perfect evening.WHEN Kim Kardashian is the most elegant and tastefully dressed woman in the room, you know that something has gone horribly awry.So it was at the ludicrous Met Gala in New York, which saw a procession of show-offs dressing up like extras from the Monty Python sketch about the Spanish Inquisition.Madonna looked like Dracula’s mad old aunty, Sarah Jessica Parker had a nativity scene on her head, and don’t get me started on Rihanna, who came as some sort of sexy bishop mashed up with a pearly queen.It made Kim’s skin-tight gold sheath Versace dress appear to be the epitome of class.We are told the Pope approved this farrago, which was pompously entitled Heavenly Bodies: Fashion And The Catholic Imagination.His endorsement should make you shudder – until you realise that’s how he always dresses.He’s also a man with a passion for red leather Prada slip-ons, so I suppose he is more connected to the weird world of fashion than your average parish priest.A great deal of money is raised for good causes at this tacky celebration of fame and fortune, and that’s all well and good. But maybe next year they should stay at home and write a cheque.One thing is certain. You can be darned sure they won’t follow up the Catholic theme by making a mockery of Islam or Judaism.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which they are.The Sun is all for more grammar ­places so long as a generous proportion are guaranteed for children from low-income families — as they will be.We back more choice, smaller classes and higher standards. So does the nation.DONALD Trump has been given the usual kicking over Iran — but he may be right.Barack Obama’s dodgy deal freed the mullahs to spend billions spreading war and terrorism throughout Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Gaza.Trump aims to halt that and punish the extremist regime. Who knows . . . maybe Iran’s people will finally revolt.Trump’s aggression and rash tweets have surprising upsides. He has helped propel North Korea towards peace.That’s more than Obama achieved during eight years of sonorous speeches which disguised dithering timidity.WHAT a surprise. A rabidly left-wing UN “racism inspector” sent to “find out” if Britain is more racist since the Brexit vote has decided — wait for it — we ARE!Her bogus “report” is a load of pre-meditated and vacuous bilge designed to bash ­Britain and the Leave vote.It must have irritated Tendayi Achiume to have to leave her home in the Californian sunshine for the charade of a 12-day UK tour amassing “evidence”.Here’s an idea, though.

The shocked OAP, unsure what to do with the pony, contacted World Horse Welfare who got in touch with the RSPCA.The animal charity today released pictures of the pony stranded in the small yard of the house surrounded by wheelie-bins, garden furniture and a rabbit hutch.RSPCA inspector Charlotte Melvin, who attended the property to check over the horse, said: You couldnt make this up.A 13-year-old girl responded to a plea on an online free ads site where a lady said she didnt want the pony anymore and that he would be put to sleep if no one had him.She gave her nans address and the next thing that happened was a man just came along and dumped the pony there, no words of advice or anything like that - and leaving a very shocked nan.We dont know where this poor pony came from but he clearly was not treated well before being abandoned.We have come to a dead end in trying to find out further information so we are appealing for anybody who can help us to get in touch.The pony, who has been named Mr Melvin Andrews, is now in the care of World Horse Welfare.Field officer Rachel Andrews who transported the animal to a private boarding establishment, said she hoped the incident was not the start of a new trend.She added: Were seeing sick or young ponies being dumped and abandoned when their owners no longer want them, and it would be a worry if online free ad sites are used in this way.Many provide advice on the commitment required to take on a horse.Every horse and pony deserves responsible ownership, which includes responsible breeding, selling and rehoming.Were just glad that Melvin the pony has settled in well at our Penny Farm Rescue and Rehoming Centre and has already shown himself to be lovely a little pony and we hope in time we can find him a good home.Anyone who has any information is asked to call the RSPCAs appeals line on 0300 123 8018 or World Horse Welfare at 08000 480 180.Last month, the RSPCA revealed that the number of horses rescued by the charity has reached a four-year high, as the equine crisis continues to have devastating consequences.The charitys annual Cruelty Statistics revealed that nearly 1,000 horses were rescued by the charity from cruelty, suffering and neglect last year (2017), and a staggering 928 horses are currently in the charitys care."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000405509322.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"queen windsor horse show head scarf coat week meghan markle prince harry wedding","story":"Her Majesty was in high spirits in the private grounds of Windsor Castle where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are set to wed next week.On the penultimate day of the equestrian event, The Queen opted to re-wear the David Barry quilted jacket and chic blue tartan skirt she wore yesterday.The Queen has not missed the event since it was first held in 1943 in a bid to help raise money for the war effort.Joining hundreds of public spectators, she was spotted giggling with organisers and holding a green rosette.The 92-year-old monarch was joined by her daughter-in-law Sophie Countess of Wessex and granddaughter Lady Louise Windsor, 14.Her appearance today despite dreary weather conditions, comes after Prince Phillip was spotted speaking to Queen Elizabeth in his Land Rover during the show yesterday.Philip, who was pictured for the first time since leaving hospital after his successful hip operation.There had been some concern over whether he will attend Harry and Meghans wedding next weekend.The palace is yet to officially confirm if he will be at the ceremony next Saturday.In a statement released by the palace last week, more details of the guests were revealed.It was confirmed newborn Prince Louis not among them, but with his siblings Prince George, four, and Princess Charlotte, two, expected to be there.With the countdown to the wedding now in earnest, final preparations are being put in place for Harry and Meghans big day next Saturday.Security barriers are being put in place and an elaborate police deployment plan has been mapped out.About 100,000 spectators are expected to flock to Windsor to join the wedding celebrations and watch the newlyweds carriage procession after they exchange vows at the castles St Georges Chapel.There is speculation Ms Markles mother Doria Ragland, who will play an important role during the day with her father Thomas Markle, may have already flown to the UK.Harry and Meghan have invited 600 guests to their wedding and after the carriage ride through the streets of Windsor will join them for an afternoon reception hosted by the Queen."},{"url":null,"title":"greek orthodox bishop baptism violent dunks baby water","story":"In the footage that has appeared online the man of the cloth repeatedly dunks the naked baby into the baptismal font.The tot is rapidly dunked three times into the water before being handed back to his unperturbed parents.According to reports the footage was taken in Ayia Napa, Cyprus, at a Greek Orthodox church.With the church, baptisms are usually done ‘forcefully’ which is seen as a solution to the declining birth rate.Many online commentators have criticised the bishop’s rather rough approach.One Twitter user posted: Omg that’s the most violent baptism?!

On Saturday at 11.59am precisely — these royal weddings really do run like Rolex watches — Thomas will meet his daughter at the West Door of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, and escort her to where her ginger Prince Charming is waiting.“Poor Pa Markle!” sighed one pundit. “A total nightmare!”I have a different prediction. This shy man with an allergy to publicity will tug on the heartstrings of the world at Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Because no matter how awkward it feels to be under the pitiless gaze of planet Earth, Thomas Markle is above and beyond all else, a proud and loving father.No matter how bashful his instincts may be, no matter how comfortable he was in obscure retirement in Rosarito, Mexico, I would bet my life that there was never a chance that he would miss his daughter’s wedding. Thomas Markle is clearly — and understandably — apprehensive about the big day.He has been seen in one of his local cafes in Mexico, head buried in a book called Images Of Britain. At an internet cafe, he stares with some bewilderment at the engagement photos of Meghan and Harry. But what father of the bride, any bride, would not feel a giddy cocktail of pride, anxiety and a touch of sadness at the prospect of walking his baby girl down the aisle?I doubt if he is enjoying the big build-up — having a wedding suit made to fit his bear-like frame, contemplating meeting the Queen, Prince Philip and the sprawling royal clan, and, horror of horrors, working out what to say when he rises to his feet to make that wedding speech.But Thomas Markle’s nerves about the big day do not make him a misfit or a freak. They make him gloriously human. Meghan Markle is loved because she brings some Hollywood flash to our staid, stoic, rather fusty Royal Family.But Meghan is also loved because she seems strangely familiar to us — a mixed-race child of divorced parents, divorced herself and a working woman who has fought hard for her success.Beyond the showbiz gloss, we have some understanding of the life of Meghan Markle. Because millions of our own lives are not so different.Because no matter how self-conscious this shy man feels taking to the global stage, his overwhelming emotions on his daughter’s wedding day will be love and pride. As any father of the bride will tell you, love and pride trump everything.IT is exciting news that Major League Baseball is coming to the capital for the first time next year, when the Boston Red Sox meet the New York Yankees at the London Stadium.  Mayor Sadiq Khan has worked hard to make this happen.WITH their fiery eyes and flashing thighs, female cadets in Vladimir Putin’s barmy Red Army look as though they are ready to invade somewhere.Possibly Stringfellows.WHAT makes Brexit inevitable is the total lack of respect shown to this country by Brussels since we decided to leave.German EU commissioner Gunther Oettinger sneers that Theresa May is “weak” and mocks Boris Johnson for having the same hair as Donald Trump.“That says everything,” sneers Herr Oettinger, 64, who once called a group of Chinese ministers “slitty-eyed” and has joked that gay marriage will become compulsory.And that says all you need to know about this buffoon. LABOUR’S Emily Thornberry has called for the Little Miss books to be renamed because they are sexist.“I don’t like this thing about being little,” says Emily. “I think that’s my problem with the Mr Men books.” Funny enough, that’s my problem with the Labour Party. The institutionalised sexism. The casual misogyny. The assumption that men should lead and the little ladies should tiptoe meekly behind.The Labour Party is at least as overtly sexist as the Little Miss books, Emily.The Tories are already on their second female Prime Minister while Labour have never even had a woman as their leader. Why not? It’s not as though the long line of miserable male mediocrities who have led Labour were much cop.It’s hard to believe that Barbara Castle or Yvette Cooper wouldn’t have done a better job of leading Labour than Foot, Kinnock, Brown, Miliband or Corbyn – who didn’t win one General Election between them.If Thornberry truly wants to prove that women can do anything that men can do, she should be demanding to know why no woman has ever led Labour in its 118-year-history.When washing down the next bacon butty, better stick to the decaffeinated coffee, Ed.SIR BOBBY ROBSON inspired the current managers of Manchester United and Manchester City, and inspired love in all who played for him from England to Barcelona, including Paul Gascoigne in his mercurial prime. Sir Bobby remains one of only two England managers to take our national team to a World Cup semi-final.The subject of a new feature film called Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, Robson was clearly a wise and com-passionate man.In comparison, Sir Alf Ramse was a cold, distant and aloof figure with a robotic voice and a weird accent fabricated by elocution lessons. He went to school with my father – he should have talked like a Cockney, not the Duchess of Devonshire.But Sir Alf did it. He made the dream – that eternal dream of every England football fan – come true.So I have to beg to differ when Gary Lineker says that Sir Bobby Robson is the “best England manager of all time”. There is only one Sir Alf Ramsey.THE Met Gala is the most fashionable party in New York and this year the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – inspiring a host of celebrities to bowl up in what looked like deeply religious lingerie. Rihanna was possibly a mini-skirted Pope or perhaps a cleavage-flashing cardinal. Katy Perry was an angel.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had a golden halo and a neckline that skimmed her navel. Madonna wore a crown made of multiple crucifixes.It is true that these Big Apple fashionistas – the Met Gala is hosted by the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour – would not have taken the mick out of any non-Christian religion. But perhaps that is a compliment to Christianity. It can be mocked by empty-headed, attention-seeking celebrities and nobody gets a death threat. Perhaps all religions should be this tolerant.“I no longer want to continue life,” said Dr Goodall before he died. “I’m happy to have the chance to end it.”Every one of us should have that choice.

But man and boy, I have collected football programmes. What could be a more evocative memento of a match? An overpriced replica shirt? A polyester team scarf? A football programme is the next best thing to memories.But now, after more than a century of programmes being sold on match days, the English Football League will decide in June if it will continue to make it compulsory for clubs to produce them.In the age of social media, the death of football programmes makes sense, although 600,000 of them are still sold every weekend. But there will be a little less magic in the world if they are allowed to die.I still have my treasured copy of England v West Germany in the World Cup Final of 1966.

If Prince Harry and Meghan’s wedding is anything like our day it will be truly magical.“When we signed the register at The Guildhall we realised that we have become a part of Royal history - in just a few days time Harry and Meghan will sign the same one!“We couldn’t be happier or more grateful to the Sun on Sunday.”Delighted Natalie, a customer services rep, and Rich, who works in asset finance, said ‘I do’ in front of their loved ones on Friday.Their no-expense-spared prize wedding day cost in excess of £25,000 and included a lavish reception, vintage car, flowers, cake, rings, photographer, videographer and all the bridal outfits and suits. Every last detail was meticulously planned to ensure Rich and Natalie felt like a Prince and Princess and were treated to the wedding of their dreams, just eight days before Harry and Meghan marry next Saturday.And their big day meant even more to them, because Rich, 29, is a huge royal fan who met Princess Diana the day he was born.From a young age he would tell how, at less than two hours old, he was chosen for his meeting with Diana when she opened a maternity ward in the hospital where his mum Kath gave birth.He said: “My mum is so proud of meeting Princess Diana and shows that photograph to everyone.There has always been a royal connection for me, so to have been able to wed here in Windsor just a week before Prince Harry is brilliant.“This has been the best day of our lives, without a doubt. I know everyone says that about their wedding day, but this has been incredibly special.“Every detail was perfect and it all went to plan. Natalie looks beautiful and I’m so proud to call her my wife.“We can’t thank the Sun on Sunday enough. You’ve made us feel like royalty on the most important day of our lives.”Natalie, 24, added: “It has been a dream come true. We never would have been able to afford a wedding this beautiful and special. I know Meghan is getting married here next week, but today I feel like the Princess.”Rich and Natalie’s special day began at The Oakley Court Hotel - a stunning Victorian Mansion overlooking the River Thames with stunning grounds - where the bride and her bridesmaids had full hair and make up done.The stunning 1859 hotel, a stone’s throw from the Castle, can boast both King Edward VII and Napoleon IV as guests - and even played host to Harry’s Grandmother, HRH Queen Elizabeth in 2009.Portrait photographer Patrick Balls and videographers from Dom Balls Events were on hand to capture candid shots of the girls as they were pampered.There wasnt a dry eye as Natalies dad Mark, 51, saw her in her stunning wedding dress for the first time and proudly led his daughter to the 1939 Rolls-Royce Wraith called Victoria courtesy of Charismatic Cars that took them to The Guildhall in Royal Windsor town centre.Rich, his two best men and groomsmen - who were all kitted out in blue suits from Cookham Formal Hire and with button holes from Marks and Spencer - took selfies and giggled as they waited for Natalies big arrival.She looked beautiful as she slowly walked towards her happy groom with her attendants - bridesmaid Hannah Cawthray, 24, her nieces and flower girls Martha and India Pickering, aged six and one, and page boy Freddie Adamson, three - who were all dressed in beautiful outfits courtesy of Monsoon and Accessorize and carrying white and green bouquets from Marks and Spencer.The pair giggled before nervously holding hands and saying their vows in the same venue where Prince Charles wed Camilla in April 2005. The pair exchanged platinum wedding bands from Winsor Bishop Jewellers in a room lined with Royal portraits.And as the registrar declared them man and wife, Rich kissed a delighted Natalie and a ripple of applause rang around the room.Outside Royal fans, TV crews - from across the world - and locals applauded the pair and as they headed towards The Long Walk in front of Windsor Castle the couple waved at their new fans before returning to The Oakley Court Hotel as man and wife.The couple had a lavish reception courtesy of the hotel - with a Pimm’s reception and a BBQ feast that included burgers, tuna steaks, pork loin and salads.As the guests ate in the stretch marquee - with more stunning flowers from Marks and Spencer on the tables - singer Kelly Barnes performed.And it was there that the newlyweds met their VIP guests Harry and Meghan - lookalikes Rhys Whittock and Sarah Mhlanga, both 35.Rich laughed: “Now that they’ve been guests on our day we think they’ll return the favour and invite us to their big day!“It was great to meet them. A lot of heads turned to see them there with us. It was the icing on the cake for our day!”In his speech Rich praised his new bride adding: Natalie, you look stunning today, I love you so much and I always will. I know well have an amazing life together.The newlywed husband also took a moment to thank The Sun on Sunday adding: Were eternally grateful for everything thats been done for us.While Prince Harry will remember his mother Princess Diana on his big day this week, Rich also took a moment to remember his brother Barry, who also passed away in a car accident when he was just 23-years-old in 2004. Choking back tears Rich admitted how much he missed his big brother on the most memorable day of his life.He said: Baz was my best friend and I know hed have loved Natalie and looked after her, I know wed all give anything to have him here.The happy couple then cut their amazing cake from Marks and Spencer that included carrot, lemon, fruit and chocolate tiers.With all formalities out of the way, it was time to kick back, relax and let loose – just as Harry and Meghan will at their private reception at Frogmore House.The guests all headed to the hotels Windsor Suite and as the band ‘Get On Up’ started performing Rich and Natalie took to the floor for their first dance.Guests laughed, danced, drank and ate sausage and bacon baps until the early hours before the music wound down.Wedding planner Francesca Cook who organised the day and, together with her team of staff, made sure everything went without a hitch, said: “We were thrilled to plan and host the wedding - it was a truly special day.”Natalie’s mum Bridget, 56, said: “We have been excited ever since Natalie and Rich won the competition. Its been a wonderful day.And Natalie said: “I can’t stop smiling. I don’t want this night to end. I’m worn out but delighted - everything has been perfect.”And it was a perfect day when Rich was born at the Beverley Westwood Hospital, East Yorks, in 1988 and he was chosen to meet Princess Diana who was opening the ward that day.His mum, post lady Kath, now 61 and married to retired businessman Sam, 67, told us: “I instantly said yes! I love the Royals.“So to have my son now marry in a wedding fit for royalty, just before Harry and Meghan, is a dream. It’s been a perfect day.“Meeting Harry’s mother Princess Diana 29 years ago when Richard was less than two hours old is etched in our memories.

It takes an average of four months to deport each one.The Home Office put the rise down to improvements in identifying foreign criminals.It added: “Those who commit crimes in the UK should be in no doubt of our determination to deport them.“We have removed more than 41,000 since 2010.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because it is supported by wooden peers.”The second chamber that acts within constitutional conventions is beneficial and helps prevent the “elected dictatorship” that our system of government can create.Asking the Government and the House of Commons to think again is both reasonable and valuable — it also has a distinguished history.As long ago as 1539, when Henry VIII was at his most powerful, the Lords amended his Act of Proclamation, which would have allowed monarchical despotism.This is the first example I know of the Upper House acting successfully as a revising chamber and preserving the nation’s liberties. The legislation was so ineffective that it was repealed eight years later.It is that act which spawned the expression “Henry VIII powers”, now used to describe the ability of ministerial action to amend the law.In the EU Withdrawal Bill, it is wholly unexceptional for the Lords to seek to reduce the number and extent of the Henry VIII powers available to the Government.These are technical issues when it is a matter of judgement as to where the balance between efficiency and process lies. It is not an attack on the democratic process or a power grab by an unelected chamber.This is not true of some of the other amendments passed against the withdrawal bill. There is a rule that the Lords does not oppose manifesto commitments.It was introduced in the 1940s to stop an inbuilt Tory majority blocking the then Labour government’s programme.It has relevance of a particular kind today when a Labour and LibDem majority could vote down any government proposal it dislikes.As was found in the 1940s, the Lords needs to observe this self-denying ordinance if it is to maintain credibility, otherwise it quickly becomes a matter of Peers against the People.In trying to insist on the UK remaining in a customs union, the Lords has overturned a specific manifesto promise by the Conservatives. Removing the date of departure — March 29, 2019 — similarly overturns an implicit guarantee in the same document.These are two of the most egregious breaches of the convention and raise the question: What is the Lords for?Tomorrow, it may be about to get worse. There is an amendment to the Data Protection Bill to require the Government to carry out Part Two of the Leveson Inquiry.This is in the name of Baroness Hollins, who has every right to feel her family was badly treated by the Press. And although I disagree with her, she deserves considerable sympathy because of what happened.Nonetheless, she is on dangerous constitutional ground.Page 80 of the Tory party manifesto says: “Given the comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and the lengthy investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing, we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the Press.”This could not be clearer, yet the Lords are contemplating legislating to force this second stage upon the nation. It is a clear and outright tearing up of conventions.Unfortunately, it is even more serious than an arrogant desire to overrule a manifesto commitment — it is a proposal for the Lords to do the opposite of what it is there to do.The Lords ought to protect the liberties of the country against attempts by the government to erode them.It used to do this when it opposed extensions to detention without trial or efforts to reduce freedom of speech.Now it is suggested it will do the reverse to make our media less free and to ignore fundamental rights of justice.In just four years, the UK has already fallen ten places — from 30th to 40th — in the global rankings for free speech.Dozens of journalists have been put on trial and mainly acquitted for the reporting of stories involving the police and other public officials.The Leveson Inquiry was used to put journalists in the public pillory and now it is proposed that this should happen all over again.People who have been acquitted of a crime have nothing further to answer for and to demand they go on oath to rehash issues settled by a jury is the type of bullying of the Press normally seen in totalitarian states.If Lady Hollins’s amendment were passed, it would be giving in to the vested interests of the rich and powerful to punish newspapers which had exposed their peccadilloes.It would deter the Press from such fearless reporting in future and would be an attack on one of our most ancient and precious freedoms, a pillar of our constitution.A free Press must not be bullied or harried by those who do not like what it reports or else self-censorship will be the rule of the day.Fundamental questions will arise about the Lords if it ignores the constitutional conventions, sets Peers against the People and, instead of being the bulwark against an over-mighty Government becomes the cheerleader for censorship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In Labour strongholds, you\u0027d be hard pressed to find any.But after the PM lost her Commons majority in last year\u0027s general election, she doesn\u0027t have the votes in the Commons for a widespread expansion of the grammar school system.So she\u0027s now attempting to boost the ones that are there already, with a \u0026#16350m fund to create thousands of extra places, many for pupils from poorer backgrounds.She has found a willing accomplice in Damian Hinds, a grammar school boy from Altrincham in Manchester\u0027s leafier suburbs, who was promoted to Education Secretary in the January reshuffle.His two predecessors in the job, Justine Greening and Nicky Morgan, both of whom were sacked by Mrs May, didn\u0027t care for grammar schools at all.Ms Greening, who last week urged employers to discriminate against applicants from Eton, is a steelworker\u0027s daughter from Rotherham who went to the town\u0027s Oakwood Comprehensive School.As the Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran put it, rather colourfully: \"We now know what we suspected. Justine Greening was moved on to make way for a lap dog for Theresa May\u0027s pet projects.\"So why the PM\u0027s enthusiasm for grammars? She and other supporters claim they\u0027re good for social mobility. Opponents say they do the exact opposite.After all, a grammar school in every town suggests a secondary modern in every town too. But you won\u0027t find many Tory MPs who support grammar schools backing a return of secondary moderns for children who fail the 11-plus.Ah yes, Tory MPs! Looking at the politics of all this, surely a big motive for the PM in the Government\u0027s \u0026#16350m handout to grammar schools is pleasing Conservative backbenchers. or at least those on the Tory Right.That\u0027s because Conservative MPs who love grammar schools are largely the same ones who hate the European Union.They\u0027re also the same MPs who are currently holding the PM to ransom on Brexit and threatening to topple her if she caves in to Remainers. So cynics will regard the latest boost for grammar schools as a sop to the Tory Right, a bone tossed in their direction in the increasingly bitter Brexit dogfight - even if the Prime Minister does indeed appear to have an obsession with grammar schools.According to political journalist Rosa Prince\u0027s biography of Theresa May, The Enigmatic Prime Minister, it was at school that she became interested in politics.By the time she was in the sixth form she was apparently confident enough to announce that she intended to become Britain\u0027s first woman Prime Minister."},{"url":null,"title":"crystal meth found home office","story":"NewsCrystal meth found in Home Office HQ as new chief Sajid Javid boasts about drug sniffer dogsEXCLUSIVE: Police were called to the Home Office 10 days ago after crystal meth was twice found in toilets, but failed to launch an investigation\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNigel NelsonPolitical Editor22:30, 12 MAY 2018Updated22:31, 12 MAY 2018NewsHome Secretary Sajid Javid poses proudly with a sniffer dog – as it emerged drugs were found in his own department (Image: sajidjavid/TWITTER)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPolice were called to the Home Office after a stash of crystal meth was found four days after new Home Secretary Sajid Javid took over.

The embarrassing revelation came on the same day Mr Javid, who took over after Amber Rudd resigned a fortnight ago, tweeted a picture of himself with a Border Force officer and a sniffer dog called Trigger at Heathrow Airport. He posted: “We have impressive four-legged friends helping sniff out drugs, cash and illicit goods. Go Trigger!” Crystal meth, which featured in cult US television drama Breaking Bad, carries severe penalties for its use.  The stash of it was found on May 3 at the Home Office’s Marsham Street HQ in London’s Whitehall, where 5,000 staff are employed. An insider said: “Everyone in the building is talking about this. “We’re the lead department in the war against illegal drugs so it’s hugely embarrassing when they’re found under our noses. “Our job is to break the bad guys. not to feature in an episode of Breaking Bad.” In December last year crystal meth and a pipe were also found in a different Home Office disabled toilet. And last month cocaine was discovered elsewhere in the building. Security is tight at the Home Office, which is also responsible for co-ordinating the battle against terrorism. Visitors must go through a rigorous security system which involves body and bag scans and being sniffed by automatic devices for bombs. But staff have passes which allow them entry through automatic gates and their bags are not searched. The Home Office shares the building with Defra and Housing staff but all the drug finds occurred at its end of the premises. Buying drugs from a dealer could lay any user wide open to blackmail.  Tonight the Home Office was unable to say why the police are not investigating further. A spokeswoman told the Sunday Mirror: “We take incidents of this nature extremely seriously.” But Shadow police minister Louise Haigh said: “The Tories can’t even run their own Whitehall departments, let alone the country. With 21,000 fewer police on the beat thanks to Tory cuts, it’s crystal clear it’s time for change.” The discovery came hot on the heels of Ms Rudd quitting as Home Secretary in the Windrush immigration row. Mr Javid, formerly the Communities Secretary, walked into the Home Office on Monday, April 30 and the drugs were found on the following Thursday.

The Labour veteran, whose death was announced this morning, stunned the Lords into silence during the heartfelt speech in which she spoke about her terminal brain tumour and urged other patients not to give up hope of living decent lives. She also highlighted the shocking underfunding in neurological cancers, which receive only 2% of research monies and have had no new vital drugs for the past 50 years. Baroness Jowell, whose voice cracked several times during her House of Lords speech in January, The Labour peer,, called for more cancer treatments to be made available through the NHS and pleaded for further opportunities for adaptive trials in which patients can undergo different treatments.   Dame Tessa Jowell dead: Former Labour cabinet minister has died after cancer battle aged 70  As she delivered her impassioned plea, Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt – \u0026shyarchitect of savage NHS cuts – watched in silence. And after she spoke, peers – many of whom had been brought to tears – gave the 70-year-old the first ever standing ovation in the upper chamber. Looking frail and her voice cracking with emotion, Dame Tessa said: “Cancer is a tough challenge to all health systems, and particularly our cherished NHS. “We have the worst survival rate in western Europe. Partly because \u0026shydiagnosis is too slow. Brain tumours grow very quickly and are hard to spot.  “In the end, what gives a life meaning is not only how it is lived, but how it draws to a close. “I hope this debate will give hope to other cancer patients like me, so that we can live well with cancer, not just be dying of it. All of us, for longer. Wearing a beanie hat with white wires coming from the back, the former Culture Secretary spoke starkly of her glioblastoma – a rare and aggressive cancer that affects fewer than 3,000 people in England every year. She said: “I was on my way to talk about Sure Start projects. I got into a taxi but couldn’t speak. I had two powerful seizures. I was taken to hospital. “Two days later, I was told that I had a brain tumour, glioblastoma \u0026shymultiforme, or GBM. A week later the tumour was removed by an outstanding surgeon at the National Hospital in Queen Square. I then had radio and chemotherapy.” But Dame Tessa grimly declared the disease has “a very poor prognosis”.   \u0027I\u0027m going to Germany for my treatment\u0027: Former cabinet minister Tessa Jowell on brain cancer battle  She told how she believes the \u0026shyEliminate Cancer Initiative, which allows patients to take experimental risks with their treatment, could mark a \u0026shybreakthrough in the fight against the disease – if ministers support it. Dame Tessa spoke of Irish poet Seamus Heaney , saying: “[His] last words were, ‘Do not be afraid.’ I am not afraid, but I’m fearful this new and important approach may be put into the ‘too difficult’ box. But I also have such great hope. So many cancer patients collaborate and support each other. “They create that community of love and determination. “All we ask is that doctors do the same… learn from each other.  “ECI will focus initially on GBM because it is so tough to beat, so it’s all about sharing knowledge at every level. “If we achieve this we will go a long way to crack GBM and other cancers. For what would every cancer patient want? To know that the best, the latest science was being used. What else do they want? “They need to know they have a \u0026shycommunity around them supporting and caring, being practical and kind.” She said: On May 24 last year, I was on my way to talk about new Sure Start projects in East London. I got into a taxi but couldn\u0027t speak, I had two powerful seizures. I was taken to hospital. Two days later, I was told that I had a brain tumour, glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM.  A week later the tumour was removed by an outstanding surgeon at the National Hospital in Queen Square. The tribute was thought to be the first of its kind in the House of Lords. The Brain Tumour Charity praised her inspirational speech. Chief executive Sarah Lindsell said: “Tessa Jowell’s passion and dedication to public service has touched countless lives over more than four decades. This afternoon, she showed that she has lost none of her \u0026shydetermination to help others even in the most difficult personal circumstances.” Mr Hunt tweeted: “Just been privileged to listen to incredible powerful and moving speech by Tessa Jowell on the need to speed up clinical trials process for brain cancer patients. She is of course right and we look carefully at her sensible suggestions.”  Tessa Jowell\u0027s speech in full I would like to thank all those noble lords, and friends and colleagues who have shown me such support since I learned I had a brain tumour. Today is not about politics but patients: patients and the community of carers who love and support them. What is it that patients and carers feel that they need? It is, of course, about the NHS. But it is not just about money. But also about the power of kindness. It is about support for carers.

Dame Tessa had been diagnosed with a gliobastoma multiforme brain tumour in May last year. But her family revealed this morning that she suffered a haemorrhage on Friday, and had been in a coma until her death at the age of 70 yesterday. Today, she has been described as an inspirational and superb politician with the heart of a lion, the soul of an angel. Prime minister Theresa May shared a picture of the two of them laughing together on Twitter this morning, as she paid homage to the 70-year-old.  She wrote: The dignity and courage with which Dame Tessa Jowell confronted her illness was humbling and it was inspirational. My sympathies to her loving family - Dame Tessa’s campaigning on brain cancer research is a lasting tribute to a lifetime of public service. Mr Blair said Dame Tessa Jowell was the most wise of counsellors, the most loyal and supportive of colleagues, and the best of friends. He added: There was no-one like Tessa and no-one better. I will miss her more than I can say. My thoughts and prayers, and those of Cherie and all the family, are with David and her wonderful family of whom she was justly very proud.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was \u0027devastated\u0027 to hear about Dame Tessa\u0027s death. He said: From Councillor to Cabinet Minister, her achievements were huge, including helping to bring the Olympics to London. Her strength in raising awareness of her illness and fighting for better treatment for others inspired us all. Gordon Brown said Dame Tessa would be remembered for her courage, strength and compassion for others. He said: Tessa Jowell has memorable and lasting achievements to her name - as a popular London MP, a pioneering health minister and as the culture secretary who delivered the London Olympics.  No-one will ever forget the courage, strength and compassion for others that defined her life, shown in her incredible bravery in facing cancer and her desire to ensure that even while she suffered herself, she helped others who faced similar illnesses. My thoughts are with her family. Blair\u0027s former Downing Street press secretary Alastair Campbell paid tribute on Twitter saying: RIP Tessa, wonderful woman, superb politician, the kindest friend. He also share memories of the last time he saw her - just this Wednesday. He wrote: Fiona (Miller, Campbell\u0027s wife) and I last saw her, with Charlie Falconer and his wife Marianna, when we went for dinner with David and Tessa on Wednesday. It was clear that she was declining, with her speech and orientation becoming more and more challenging.    It was truly heartbreaking to see such a life force moving towards what our friend Philip Gould called ‘the death zone.’ But even today, just hours after she died, the overwhelming thoughts and memories about Tessa are all positive and life-affirming. This Friday, we were due to go to a concert in Edinburgh, of the Scottish traditional music band, Skipinnish. This last New Year, we were in the Highlands together and heard the band live. Tessa was not well though, and stayed in bed. But David loved their music, and virtually every day since, they have listened to it together. So if I am allowed just one memory of Tessa, it is of her singing along to Skipinnish. One song in particular will now forever be associated in my mind with Tessa. It is called ALIVE. A popular figure in Parliament, Dame Tessa played a major role in securing the 2012 Olympics for London when she served as culture secretary.    Sky News presenter posted a picture of her and Dame Tessa hugging in a heart warming throwback photo. She wrote: RIP Tessa Jowell The heart of a lion, the soul of an angel. Her dedication to public service should be an inspiration to all who would follow her into parliament. Commons Speaker John Bercow paid tribute to Dame Tessa as an indefatigable campaigner. He said: Through her focus on Early Years provision, Tessa did more than most to improve lives and promote social justice. Passionate, warm and empathetic, she saw the best in everyone and won respect and affection across the political spectrum. Lord Sebastian Coe, former chairman of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, said there would not have been a London 2012 without the contributions of Dame Tessa.  He said: No politician deserves greater credit for the Games. She showed unflinching tenacity in persuading the Prime Minister and the Cabinet that the Government should throw its full weight behind the bid. And long after the Games were over, Tessa continued to fight for their legacy. Without her, the sporting landscape of the UK would have looked very different, and so many other tangible legacies left dormant. I will miss her enormously. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he was \u0027\u0027devastated\u0027\u0027 by the loss of Dame Tessa. He tweeted: \u0027\u0027She was quite simply the bravest and the best \u0026amp brought magic to whatever she touched whether SureStarts, London 2012 or campaigning for those who like her were battling with incurable cancer. RIP\u0027\u0027  Former Labour leader Ed Miliband said: \u0027\u0027So sad to hear of the death of Tessa Jowell. I will remember her warmth, her passion, her goodness her decency. \u0027\u0027And the extraordinary way she coped with her cancer and tried to use it to help others. The world is a sadder place without Tessa. Deepest condolences to her family.\u0027\u0027 Labour MP for Tottenham David Lammy tweeted: \u0027\u0027Sad Tessa has died. Loved working for her as Culture Minister. I remember her determination to win the Olympics, depths of compassion with the victims of 7/7 bombings and enthusiasm that the arts are an entitlement for every child not just the privileged.\u0027\u0027 Former acting leader of the Labour Party Harriet Harman said Dame Tessa was about making politics personal. She said: She nurtured personal relationships to build support for projects she wanted to see happen - like the Olympics.  Her politics was personal - supporting colleagues with a sick child or a dying parent. And because everything she said or did was intertwined with the personal, she was more effective. She didn\u0027t follow the political rules of the day. She followed her personal instinct. But she was no softie. She was clever and tough. MP for Ashton-under-Lyne, Droylsden and Failsworth, Angela Rayner, wrote on Twitter: So sorry to hear the news this morning that former Labour cabinet minister Dame Tessa Jowell has died. A highly respected politician and stalwart of the Labour Party over many years. My deepest condolences to her family and friends at this sad time.   Dame Tessa Jowell, who has died of cancer aged 70, enjoyed a political career spanning almost 50 years that began soon before Labour entered its wilderness years. Born in London in 1947, she was brought up in Aberdeen, where her father worked at the medical school, before returning to the capital to train as a social worker. She reputedly stood as a Camden councillor in 1970 assuming she\u0027d lose - only to win and then chair the social services committee aged 25. The political bug bit her and she stood in marginal Ilford North in 1978 and 1979. But like many Labour hopefuls, she lost to a wave of support for Margaret Thatcher. It was another 13 years before she finally won the Dulwich seat in 1992, holding it for 23 years. She was one of the 101 female MPs - dubbed the \u0027Blair Babes\u0027 in less self-aware times - who coasted into Parliament on Tony Blair\u0027s 1997 landslide. And Dame Tessa was the firmest Blair ally you could ask for. She once said she\u0027d jump under a bus for the ex-PM, and held dinners with other leading female allies including Margaret Hodge and Harriet Harman.   Rewarded for her talent and loyalty, Dame Tessa had a string of frontbench jobs in health, women\u0027s rights before joining the Cabinet as Culture Secretary in 2001. It was that role that would make her. She tirelessly championed London\u0027s bid to host the Olympic games - and won it in 2005 in the face of Civil Service and Cabinet scepticism. The victory was tinged with tragedy. A day later, four men with rucksacks killed 52 people in the 7/7 London terror attacks. And later, the great recession would strike. In 2008, as the Olympics cost billions while thousands lost their jobs, Dame Tessa said: Had we known what we know now, would we have bid for the Olympics? Almost certainly not. Dame Tessa lost her Cabinet post in Gordon Brown\u0027s 2007 reshuffle, but remained Olympic minister and oversaw every stage of the games, from initial bid to competition. Ed Miliband, who was Labour leader during the games, said at the time she had left an enormous legacy and that the country owed her a debt of gratitude. Dame Tessa also served as employment minister and minister for women, and remained on Mr Miliband\u0027s frontbench in opposition before stepping down from the Commons in 2015. She was made Dame Tessa in the 2012 Birthday Honours for political and charitable services, partly for her Olympics work.   And she was a sure bet for a peerage - being made Baroness Jowell of Brixton after her retirement as an MP in 2015. She later stood to be Labour\u0027s candidate for mayor of London in 2016 but, with party feeling swinging away from the politics of Tony Blair, she lost the nomination to Sadiq Khan. Her career was not without controversy. Early on, she was forced to defend the exemption of Formula One at the time from a ban on tobacco ads. Later, as Culture Secretary, she met controversy over plans for flexible drinking hours and for Britain\u0027s first super-casino. But by far the most well-known controversy was her high-profile split from her lawyer husband David Mills in 2006. Dame Tessa admitted being unaware he had paid off part of their mortgage with \u0026pound350,000 at the centre of a bribery case involving former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. Mr Mills was charged along with Mr Berlusconi with corruption in Milan and was convicted in his absence in February 2009, before being acquitted by the Italian Supreme Court under Italy\u0027s statute of limitations a year later.   The couple, who married in 1979 after Dame Tessa split from her first husband Sir Roger Jowell, parted after it was said to be damaging Dame Tessa\u0027s career, but they were later reconciled. Mr Mills accompanied her, along with their children Jess and Matthew, to Buckingham Palace when she was invested with her damehood in January 2013. The speed of her late physical decline was dramatic. On May 24 last year she had two seizures in a taxi as she made her way to a talk in east London. Two days later she was told she was suffering from a rare type of brain tumour, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). She devoted her last months to an emotional campaign for more cancer treatments to be available through the NHS, including meeting PM Theresa May who called her an inspiration. And she was trying treatments herself, wearing a \u0026pound240,000 electronic skull cap. In February her daughter, Jess Mills, said she was seriously optimistic. Dame Tessa\u0027s final legacy will be her emotional January 2018 speech in the Lords in which she called for more wide-ranging and better-funded cancer care. She received a standing ovation as she told peers: In the end, what gives a life meaning is not only how it is lived, but how it draws to a close. I hope this debate will give hope to other cancer patients like me. So that we can live well with cancer, not just be dying of it."},{"url":null,"title":"who dame tessa jowell profile","story":"NewsWho was Dame Tessa Jowell?

But splits in her Cabinet are now so serious the PM has been forced to set up rival teams to sort out her two options to replace the EU customs union. One is looking at the customs partnership Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson branded “crazy.” This would see the UK collecting EU duty on imports and giving refunds on goods destined for Britain.   That’s being thrashed out by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and Environment Secretary Michael Gove in favour of it and Cabinet Office minister David Lidington who is against.

Father-of-six Neil Whitfield, 60, claims heavy mobile phone use in the late 1990s caused a deadly growth.  His job meant using a phone for long spells – and in the days before it was illegal he had the gadget pressed to his ear while driving. Neil developed an acoustic neuroma tumour on a nerve between his inner ear and brain. He was left deaf in one ear after surgery in 2001 to remove a growth the size of a golf ball. He also suffers with balance problems.  Neil said: “I have no doubt my tumour was caused by mobile phones. “I spent almost five years glued to my phone hours at a time until I was diagnosed. I could feel the heat coming off it. “I know this is going to be a real David and Goliath battle. It might take a while before it’s settled but I won’t give up. “This is for the future of my children and kids everywhere.” Neil is the first Brit to sue a mobile phone company on these grounds and the case – six years in the making – could trigger hundreds of similar claims.  His battle for “significant” \u0026shycompensation comes as a controversial report alleges cell phones could be behind a surge in certain tumours. Solicitor Katrina Pope, of London Corporate Legal, in Mayfair, expects to make a “strong claim” by the end of 2018. Katrina, who has been working unpaid on the case since 2012, said: “A win in the High Court could set a legal precedent for other cases which we are aware of and that are watching our progress. “It is ultimately about justice for many people who have, akin to Neil, been victims of what some experts describe as the ‘smoking gun of the 21st century’.  “Neil’s personal injury claim is outside the legal time frame of three years. We argue it’s only now that the technology exists for radiation testing to allow us to bring the case – the first in Britain.” Millions of Brits used Nokia phones in the 1990s. In 1995 just seven per cent of Brits had a cell phone but by 1999 one was sold every four seconds – and Nokia was the biggest manufacturer of mobiles. Figures published last week show cases of a brain tumour called glioblastoma in England rose from 983 to 2,531 between 1995 and 2015. It is found in the forehead and side regions of the brain. And a study in the Journal of Public Health and Environment found higher rates of tumours in the frontal \u0026shytem-poral lobe which “raises the suspicion mobile and cordless phone use may be promoting gliomas”.  Neil, from Wigan, Gtr Manchester, had to give up his job as a construction material salesman because he refused to carry on using mobiles. His claim centres around years of lost income and reduced \u0026shyretirement payments after a \u0026pound20,000-a-year drop in pay to become a college lecturer. Katrina added: “It is quite possible that a claim for life-changing damages such as Neil’s could achieve a compensation award in the region of \u0026pound1million.” The law firm has commissioned experts to carry out radiation tests on Nokia phones used by Neil, including the 5510. Katrina said: “The evidence is being collated.”  The surgeon who removed Neil’s tumour at Manchester’s Royal \u0026shyInfirmary, Professor Shakeel Saeed, said of the case: “At a personal level one cannot rule out the risk based on the current evidence.” The debate over possible hazards has raged for 20 years. Scientific studies have mostly concluded they pose no peril at the level of most people’s use. One expert backing Neil, Dr Erica Mallery-Blythe, specialises in conditions related to radio frequency \u0026shyradiation and other \u0026shyelectromagnetic fields. She cited a study by the American National Toxicology Program, which she said demonstrated “clear evidence” of \u0026shyschwannoma – tumours of nerve sheath – after testing mobile phone radiation on rats. Occupational and environmental consultant Colin Purnell said older phones held a greater risk because there were fewer masts in the 1990s and mobiles had to emit greater radiation levels to pick up signals.  Cancer Research moved to quell panic, saying there is no conclusive evidence that mobiles cause problems. Dr Lion Shahab, senior lecturer in \u0026shyepidemiology and public health at \u0026shyUniversity College London, said: “Many environmental and lifestyle factors have changed. While there has been a rise in this type of tumour, it would be premature to conclude this is due to mobile phones.” While experts are divided on the risks, Neil, meanwhile, told how his life has been greatly affected. He said: “I can’t even wear a hearing aid because all my inner ear organs had to be removed. “If I go swimming and close my eyes I go round in circles. I loved music but I’ve been robbed of that too because the stereo element has been taken away.  “My youngest son Harry, 13, is desperate for a mobile but I worry about giving him one. Companies should at least put \u0026shywarnings on packaging so people can make informed choices.

A spokesman said: “All products comply with \u0026shyinternational exposure guidelines and limits that are set by public health \u0026shyauthorities. “The World Health \u0026shyOrganisation factsheet states that ‘A large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades to assess whether mobile phones pose a potential health risk. To date, no adverse health effects have been \u0026shyestablished for mobile phone use’.”  More radiation as old phones found a signal Experts claim old mobile phones carried a greater health risk than modern units as they produced greater radiation to receive signals. Colin Purnell, an environmental consultant, says early models had to emit more radiofrequency to connect with fewer masts available in the 1990s. He said: “If you are looking at something in the distance and you can’t see it you might want to use a pair of binoculars to improve the power of your eyes. “Well, it’s the same with mobile phones. In the old days there weren’t as many masts as now and if you operated your phone in a bad signal area it chucked out more radiation to find the power base. The risk associated with mobile phone use now is probably less then in the ’90s. “There are more masts and the technology is better to detect signals without a lot of radiation.” He said the way people use their phones today – using texts or Skype – also reduces the risk because it keeps phones away from the face.

Harry and Meghan are due to tie the knot in Windsor next Saturday, and experts predict bright sunshine and high temperatures. Some bookmakers have even suggested it could be the hottest day of the year so far. Around 100,000 well-wishers are expected to line the streets around Windsor Castle, where the ceremony will take place. Forecasters say the temperature could soar to around 22C - around 5C higher than the average temperature for this time of year - as a \u0027French frazzle\u0027 heatwave arrives.  But bookmaker Coral is offering odds of 2-1 on it being the hottest day of the year so far, and 6-4 on it reaching 29.1C. John Hill, from the betting firm, said: The betting suggests Prince Harry and Meghan may have picked the perfect date for their wedding as it could be the hottest day of the year so far. “With temperatures set to soar this week, the odds have been slashed on 29.1C or higher being recorded, while there is confidence behind this summer being the hottest since records began.  Crowds should make sure they bring sun cream, experts said, with warm air from France set to turn the day into a scorcher. The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “The weather gods look like smiling on Harry and Meghan. The bride’s worries about getting her dress wet are receding. “With 21C highs in Windsor, parts of the country could see a royal roast for the celebrations.” MeteoGroup forecaster Mario Cuellar said: “Saturday looks pleasant for the wedding, with a chance of 22C if south-easterly breezes develop from an extensive areas of high pressure.”  Met Office forecaster Alex Burkill said: “It looks like turning warmer from the weekend of the royal wedding onwards.

Callum Crowley\u0027s horrified mum said she was told to expect the worst after the terrifying fall, which happened as he played with friends. The schoolboy, now 13, told mother Kate Sherwin: It\u0027s all my fault, I\u0027m going to die.  Incredibly he survived the ordeal, Wales Online reports, and Callum\u0027s family have hailed his \u0027miracle\u0027 recovery.  The schoolboy, who is now 13, had been playing with friends when he nearly fell to his death. Callum’s mother Kate Sherwin had been cooking dinner at their home in Cwmbran on May 6, 2017, when she received the news.  Kate, 35, said: “Callum’s friend Marcus came in crying and said Callum had had a fall but didn’t go into detail.”  It was only after rushing to Callum on Llewellyn Road in Cwmbran that the scale of the accident became apparent.  Kate said: “With the way Marcus was crying and behaving you could tell there was something more. Callum has ADHD and with that he has no fear at all. “When I got there there was a police officer before I turned the corner.” Kate found her son lying on the floor, still conscious. She said: “I turned the corner and saw someone was on the floor. A woman was floating over him. “He was crying - he said to me ‘it’s all my fault, I’m going to die’. I burst into tears.” Kate, who is now eight and a half months pregnant, said: “My first thought was that he had gone to the first level and fallen and had broken a leg or an arm so for safety they were keeping him still. “There was a woman who had seen him on the scaffolding so I said ‘how high was he?’ and she said ‘from the top ladder’. “I remember looking up and up and up until I got to the roof and on the roof there was a ladder.”   After being painstakingly moved from the pavement to the ambulance, Callum was taken to the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport where a scan revealed the full extent of his injuries.  From there he was taken to Bristol, undergoing eight hours of emergency surgery before months of rehabilitation in Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury. Kate said: “We were put in a family room and they wouldn’t tell us anything, they wouldn’t let us in. I just wanted to be there to hold his hand, stroke his hair and tell him I loved him. “They had to put him in a coma so they could scan him. That was when they found out about the severity of the injuries. He had bleeding on the brain, he had a punctured lung, internal bleeding and a ruptured spleen. His whole body was a mess. “We were told to expect the worst.” In the early hours of Sunday morning Callum’s family found themselves praying for a miracle as he went into surgery. Kate said: “They said there was a good chance he wouldn’t make it as he had to lie on his stomach [for surgery] because of his spine. We were told because of the internal pressure it could cause problems. “I have never prayed so much in my life. He went to the surgery at 3pm and was back out at 11. He had 12 screw bolts in his spine and two rods.” For Callum and his family the operation was followed by weeks of progress but also new worries. A further inflammation of the spine saw Callum go under the knife once again, while new concerns began to surface that he could not feel his legs. “At one point Callum stopped eating,” Kate said. “We tried everything to get him eating again, we would get his favourite food or bring food in. When friends came to talk to him he would have a bite or two just to please everyone.” Kate said: “They said there was a good chance he wouldn’t make it as he had to lie on his stomach [for surgery] because of his spine. We were told because of the internal pressure it could cause problems.

The Queen signed the Instrument of Consent - an elaborate notice of approval, transcribed in calligraphy - in March, paving the way for her “dearly beloved grandson” to marry the former actress. Harry took Meghan to meet the Queen for afternoon tea at Buckingham Palace in October last year to introduce her to the woman he wanted to wed. Although the monarch was unlikely to have withheld her blessing, she would only have said no on the advice of the Prime Minister, whom she will have informed.  The official document states: Now know ye that we have consented and do by these presents signify our consent to the contracting of matrimony between our most dearly beloved grandson Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales KCVO and Rachel Meghan Markle. The wording differs from the instrument signed to give consent to the marriage of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011 when Kate was described as our trusty and well-beloved Catherine. For hundreds of years, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 required descendants of George II to seek the sovereign\u0027s consent before they wed, otherwise their marriages were deemed invalid.  But this law was repealed through the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, which came into effect in 2015 when all the Commonwealth countries, where the Queen is head of state, passed any necessary legislation. The new Act still requires the first six people in the line of succession to obtain the Queen\u0027s permission.  Harry was fifth in line when he got engaged, but is now sixth with the birth of Prince Louis. If Harry failed to get the Queen\u0027s approval, he and his future descendants would be disqualified from succeeding to the Crown. The Act was a radical shake-up of the rules of royal succession, removing male bias. Thanks to the new law, a member of the royal family can now also marry a Roman Catholic and not lose their place in the line of succession.  But a Roman Catholic royal still cannot be king or queen.

Just days away from her wedding to Prince Harry , the American actress has been warned never to rock the boat and beware some of the family.  In what many on the outside have seen as a turbulent preparation to the wedding amid family fallout, Diana’s former private secretary Patrick Jephson has written a book on how to be a successful royal newcomer. He has voiced his opinion on the need to fit in and avoid the sort of reception the American Wallis Simpson received when she married into the royal family.  The extremely controversial time in the United Kingdom’s history caused a constitutional crisis that led to the abdication of British king Edward VIII. But Mr Jephson says by following some simple steps the former Suits star has what it takes to be at the heart of the House of Windsor.  Mr Jephson’s guide for Meghan in his book The Meghan Factor, which has been adapted for the Daily Mail , includes advice like “don’t forget about the chaps”, “be true to yourself” and “steer clear of politics”.  He said: “Her job is to exist, preferably without rocking the constitutional boat. “And if, in the process, by the way she conducts her own life, she gently inspires us to do more and better with our own, then she\u0027ll probably be treated with respect and remembered with affection far into the future.”  Mr Jephson added that Princess Diana was always very aware of her own self worth and always tried to earn the awards she was given and it is important that Meghan does not form a “false sense of her own self worth”. After previously relying on her acting skills, Meghan has been warned to keep up the act, but has been told to remain authentic and give the public an honest reflection of who she really is.

Jim Ratcliffe, 65, chief executive of Ineos, topped the Sunday Times Rich List with a fortune of \u0026pound21.05 billion, leapfrogging his way from 18th place year.  Mr Ratcliffe, whose firm is currently locked in a legal battle with the Scottish government over its moratorium on fracking, emerged in pole position after additional details led to a substantial revaluation of his assets. The Sunday Times has previously described him as publicity shy.  Ineos\u0027s director Andy Currie and finance director John Reece shared in his fortunes, joining Ratcliffe in the top 20, taking joint 16th place with fortunes of \u0026pound7 billion each. At second place were the Hinduja brothers, Sri and Gopi, worth \u0026pound20.64 billion.  Their fortune jumped by \u0026pound4.44 billion on 2017, with their India-based car manufacturer Ashok Leyland and Mumbai-based IndusInd Bank having a particularly successful year. British-American industrialist-turned-media mogul Sir Len Blavatnik came in third place with \u0026pound15.26 billion to his name.  The 60-year-old was knighted this year for services to philanthropy - recent donations include \u0026pound50 million to fund the Tate Modern\u0027s new wing, and \u0026pound5 million towards the Victoria and Albert Museum\u0027s new entrance, as well as funding the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University. This year is the 30th anniversary of the Rich List, with the top 20 now worth a combined \u0026pound218.6 billion - increasing their cumulative wealth by \u0026pound33. 5 billion in the last year. Of the 1,000 people on the list, 145 are billionaires. There are now 141 women on the list, with Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken of the brewing dynasty ranked highest at number six.  She and her financier husband Michel de Carvalho - vice chairman of Citigroup - increased their wealth by almost 20% over the past year to \u0026pound11.1 billion. Elsewhere, Arcadia boss Sir Philip Green\u0027s fortune took a tumble - his reputation was dragged through the mud following the collapse of BHS after he sold it to a man twice declared bankrupt for just \u0026pound1.  It later emerged that the department store\u0027s two pension schemes had a combined shortfall of \u0026pound571 million, risking the future of their 19,000 members and prompting MPs to call Sir Philip to give evidence in front of a parliamentary select committee. Falling sales at his flagship brands Topshop and Miss Selfridge as well as his promise to contribute \u0026pound363 million towards the pension deficit led to Sir Philip\u0027s fortune dropping by \u0026pound787 million to \u0026pound2 billion. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver exited the list completely following a rocky year for his eponymous restaurant empire - it is still undergoing restructuring after racking up debts of more than \u0026pound70 million.  In January the chain announced 12 of its 37 branches were to close. Financier Ernesto Bertarelli and his wife Kirsty saw the biggest decrease in wealth, losing \u0026pound1.48 billion due to falls in Ernesto\u0027s pharmaceutical company stakes, the list\u0027s author said. The couple are now 11th on the list.  Aristocrat Hugh Grosvenor is still the UK\u0027s youngest billionaire at the age of 27 having inherited his fortune and his title - 7th duke of Westminster - following the death of his father two years ago. His property empire includes 300 acres in Mayfair and Belgravia, as well as properties in Oxford, Cheshire, Scotland and Spain. His wealth grew by \u0026pound444 million in the last year to \u0026pound9.96 billion.

Then another lad appeared, who seemed to have been chasing him, with a hammer in his hand. The lad with the hammer then hit the lad who ran into the queue, in the face. By this time, there was a lady unconscious on the floor, after she had been knocked over in the queue. People were trying to help this lady and there was so much going on. It was hard to see how many people were involved in this because the food court was so busy with customers but it seemed to me as if there were two gangs.

And the Most Rev Bishop Curry also blasted a “crisis of moral and political leadership at the highest levels of our government”.  His invitation comes months after the Royal Family confirmed Mr Trump would not be invited to the wedding. Rev Curry, 65, will give a reading at the ceremony in St George’s Chapel, Windsor, on Saturday. After his invitation was announced today he said: “The love that has brought and will bind Prince Harry and Ms Meghan Markle together has its source and origin in God, and is the key to life and happiness.” Rev Curry, from Chicago, has previously backed gay marriage and transgender rights. His latest attack on Mr Trump came in a letter to the president last week, which Mr Curry signed along with 22 other \u0026shyChristian leaders. It said: “We reject the resurgence of white nationalism and racism in our nation on many fronts, including the highest levels of \u0026shypolitical leadership.” Religious commentators also believe the letter accused Trump of repeatedly lying in office, even though it did not name him explicitly.

The pair were among three people seized after an ambush by gunmen, who shot dead a park ranger on Friday. They were kidnapped in the Virunga National Park, which is on the border with Rwanda. Bandits have reportedly demanded \u0026pound150,000 in ransom to return the Brits, who have not been identified, according to local media. Crack soldiers were sent out to the African nation in the aftermath of the attack, a military source has said.   An insider told the Sunday Express : “The SAS lads have been flown out to the DRC and are in place to do whatever is required of them to extract the targets.”  The female park ranger who tried to save two British tourists from being kidnapped before being blasted to death has been named as Rachel Katumwa. The 25-year-old was a so-called ‘ecoguard’ providing security on a convoy travelling through the Virunga National Park, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, on Friday morning. She became the first female ranger in the bloody history of the park to be murdered by bandits.  Congolese soldiers and park rangers launched an operation to find the two tourists - who are yet to be identified. Fellow park rangers confirmed that Rachel was ‘a devoted conservationist who died in the line of duty’. One added: Her only thought would have been the safety and security of visitors to the park who were on the convoy. Unfortunately armed robbers attacked as the convoy approached Rumangabo. Following the ecoguard’s death, two British citizens were taken away, along with their driver. With Virunga National Park being within our zone of action, we have joined the park rangers for search operations for the people taken hostages, Major Guillaume Kaiko Ndjike, the army\u0027s spokesman in North Kivu, said on Saturday. Rebel groups and militias still control large swathes of the territory.  More than 175 rangers have died protecting Virunga National Park, which is located in the rugged mountains and volcanic plains adjacent to neighouring Rwanda and Uganda. It has nevertheless attracted a growing number of visitors keen to visit its endangered mountain gorillas and the active Nyiragongo volcano. The Foreign Office confirmed to  that two Brits have been kidnapped. A spokesperson later said in a statement: ‘We are in close contact with the authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo following an incident involving two British nationals, and our staff are providing support to their families.’  The park was alerted to an incident at 10am and immediately deployed security staff to assess the situation, park spokesman Vianney Harakandi told CNN .         Nine countries are now at risk of Ebola after new outbreak in Congo   Reports on social media also claimed that two \u0027European\u0027 tourists were abducted and that there had been an ambush against tourists. John Ray, ITV News\u0027 African correspondent, said that a British man and woman had been kidnapped. He added that local reports claim bandits are demanding a ransom of $200,000. Park spokesman Joel Wengamulay said: We can confirm the attack, but are waiting for more details. The attack was reported at around 10am, police and soldiers are at the scene.     The incident happened days after it emerged that 17 people have died from an Ebola outbreak in the DRC, which spread through a remote area of the country into the major town Bokoro .    The World Health Organisation (WHO) said today it is planning for the worst case scenario and has alerted nine neighbouring countries. WHO\u0027s Deputy Director-General of Emergency Preparedness and Response Peter Salama says he is now hoping for the green light from the country\u0027s government to deploy a vaccine. The revelation has caused concern just a few years after Ebola swept across West Africa between 2014 and 2016, killing at least 11,000 people. It is the ninth time it has been recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo, whose eastern Ebola river gave the deadly virus its name when it was discovered there in the 1970s. Virunga National Park - spanning 3,011 miles - is located in DRC’s unstable North Kivu province. It faces multiple threats from rebel groups, local bandits and the self-defence MaiMai militia partly due to its hugely lucrative charcoal industry, for which the trees of the park are the principal raw material. It is also home to one of the world’s largest populations of critically endangered mountain gorillas as well as hundreds of other rare species. In April five rangers aged between 22 and 30 were killed in an attack from a group that officials believe belong to Mai Mai militia. However, the DRC as a whole has faced growing violence recently, with authorities advising Brits avoid numerous areas across the country. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice The FCO advise against all travel to the provinces of Kasa\u0026iuml, Kasa\u0026iuml Central, Kasa\u0026iuml Oriental, Haut-Uele, Haut Lomami, Ituri, North Kivu, South Kivu, Maniema and Tanganyika, areas to the west and east of Kananga including Tshikapa and Mwene-Ditu (as shown on the map), and within 50km of the border with the Central African Republic and South Sudan. The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the cities of Goma and Bukavu and to the districts of N’djili and Kimbanseke in Kinshasa. In 2017, there has been an increase in military and police stop-and-search checkpoints in parts of Kinshasa, especially after dark. Since July 2017, there have been increased reports of several towns in the South Kivu province of eastern DRC being attacked by or having come under the control of armed groups.  There are reports of serious clashes between Congolese Armed Forces and militia groups around Uvira in South Kivu Province.  The FCO advise against all travel to this region."},{"url":null,"title":"terrifying footage captures people running","story":"NewsTerrifying footage captures people running for safety after Paris stabbing that left one person deadWARNING DISTRESSING FOOTAGE: Police have confirmed the knifeman has been shot dead after he also reportedly left eight other injured\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRachel BishopAndrew Colley23:16, 12 MAY 2018Updated23:24, 12 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe terrifying aftermath of a street attack in Paris that left one person dead has been caught on camera with scared onlookers running for safety. Footage shot from a hotel near the horror scene in central Paris shows one person apparently laying injured as others flee for safety. Eyewitnesses reported hearing the man yelling out Allahu Akbar as he rampaged through French capital\u0027s Opera district tonight. Police confirmed the knifeman behind the killing has been shot dead - but have not confirmed whether the incident was terror-related. Eight others were also reportedly injured, two seriously, BFM TV said.  In the footage a man dressed entirely in black is seen running along a street just a few metres away from the man in the road. The footage has not been verified by police, but it was taken from a hotel on Rue Marsollier - which is directly connected to Rue Monsigny, where the knifeman reportedly carried out part of his attack. The adjacent road, Rue Saint Augustin was also shut off by police and cordoned off. Journalist Charles Pellegrin was at the scene and tweeted: I came out of a comedy show near Opera in central Paris and was immediately told to go back in because there was a madman with a knife.

There’s a few dodgy ones with the ball bouncing around and maybe a suggestion of a penalty but I felt we were well worth our three points.”County were furious at referee Andrew Dallas’ decision to book Michael Gardyne for diving with five minutes to go.Co-manager Stuart Kettlewell said: “I know there is human error in football but at the end of the day these decisions are massive.“But if you get a penalty at that stage of the game who knows what happens, you have an opportunity to get level and build momentum to win the game.“We would love to know who is accountable because we just get fobbed off all the time.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af564ee74570-e1526045769808-840x564.jpg ","title":"plans for affordable housing near new dundee super school","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe second phase of a new housing development in the north-east of Dundee offering 28 affordable new homes has been unveiled.Housebuilders Merchant Homes and the housing association Home Group Scotland are behind the multi-phase plan to develop brownfield land between Haddington Avenue, Berwick Drive, Lothian Crescent and Dunbar Park in Whitfield.The homes will sit directly behind The Crescent community centre, and will be close to Ballumbie Primary School and the new North East Campus “super-school”.Proposals for the first phase of the development, containing 13 homes that will sit on Haddington Avenue, were unveiled earlier this year.In a planning statement submitted by Merchant Homes and Home Group Scotland (HGS), the firms said the development would suit the Whitfield area due to the ongoing residential regeneration that has unfolded over the last two decades.The land on which the new homes will sit was once the site of the Skarne-style blocks which dominated the Whitfield skyline.The new homes, the planners have pledged, will have affordable rents and be energy-efficient.The companies jointly said: “The proposal is for residential development that will provide a viable and marketable development consisting of private and affordable housing.“This is an awkward and challenging site in terms of shape, topography and existing services.“These factors have largely shaped the approach that has been taken to the development of the layout for the three phases.“Consequently, it is felt that the proposals respond to the client’s brief and the requirements of Dundee City Council’s Local Development Plan to provide a design solution of high quality, which harmonises with the location and provides a development of high quality for the future residents.”In all, the completed development will have 41 homes, all of which will have driveways, and 75% of the homes will have at least three bedrooms.HGS is also involved in other developments in the Whitfield area, such as the new-build homes which have been constructed on Summerfield Avenue.The developers have said the homes will look much the same as those that have been built already.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ross county wide man michael gardyne on dundee and uniteds radar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWIth survival assured on Tuesday night, Dundee boss Neil McCann’s “recruitment drive” for next season is up and running.And one possible arrival could be Ross County playmaker Michael Gardyne – though, the Dark Blues may well have competition from across the city on their hands.The Dundonian is out of contract at the end of this season and, with his roots down here, a move back might be on the cards.His history with Dundee United – where he played 37 times in season 2012/13 – however, makes Tannadice a more likely destination for the 32-year-old.That’s likely to be dependent on whether Csaba Laszlo’s men can win promotion to the top flight via the play-offs.The Dark Blues won’t comment on any possible signings but gaffer Neil has been able to get working on improving his squad for next season after the 1-0 win at Ross County saw them guaranteed a ninth-place finish.He said: “The plans we’ve been looking at over the past five or six months in terms of recruitment we can actually start to push forward with now and start a bit of a recruitment drive.“I don’t think you can ever push on it 100% until you know you’re going to be safe.“Tuesday’s win allows us to start forward thinking but there’s still business to be done.“I’m not going to disrespect Ross County by going into Saturday (against Partick) and taking the foot off the gas and go through the motions, because we have to be professional.”Partick sit two points ahead of the Staggies in 11th spot and still with the possibility of catching Hamilton and jumping to safety. That’ll take a swing of 13 goals, however.With Thistle at risk of automatic relegation if they are beaten by the Dark Blues on Saturday, Neil knows his side will have to be on their game if they are to finish the season off on a high at Dens Park.He added: “We have to look to win it and, if we do our business right, we can hold our heads high.“We want to win at home. We’ve got back-to-back wins in the split and we’re looking for three.“I charged the boys with the task of getting five wins from five games – we’ve had three out of four and we’ll look to go into Partick and make it four out of five.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/09/bowman-390x575.jpg ","title":"tannadice game chance for arabs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBids are now being taken for fans wanting the chance to play at Tannadice in Dundee United legend Dave Bowman’s ninth annual charity match to raise funds for skin cancer and dementia charities.The game between fans making successful bids and a team of past tangerine greats takes place on Friday week with a 6.30pm kick-off.This year the fans’ team will be turning out in a special kit in honour of United’s roots as Dundee Hibernian.“This is now the ninth year of these games taking place and there is no doubt I am getting slower,” said Bowman.“The old fire is still burning so nobody better try to beat me on the park.“Seriously, this is always a great evening and a lot of fun and every year it makes me happy that players from all ability levels take part in the game.“It is all about enjoying the game.
