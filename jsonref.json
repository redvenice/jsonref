In addition they are not telling the investors how many Airbus aircraft will easyJet go ahead and pay Airbus for and how much per aircraft during the next six months using UK taxpayers money.”He said he would write to regulators at the Financial Conduct Authority to try to force easyJet to disclose the details of what had been agreed with Airbus.Lundgren said that “we remain completely focused on improving short-term liquidity and reducing expenditure across the business”.Airbus has cut back its plane production to cope with lower demand, while airlines try to save cash as they go for months without revenue. The aircraft manufacturer usually produces more than 60 of its bestselling Airbus A320 every month at assembly lines in Toulouse and Hamburg, but said it would reduce that to 40."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca6ea2653656c8eebf607df920d980902d71c0c3/102_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f93afa0761ecb5dfc95b16def15ed445","title":"manager at major uk food supplier says staff who stay at home may be sacked","story":"Video at Bakkavor site shows boss threatening staff who are also seated less than 2m apartA boss at one of the largest suppliers of fresh food to UK supermarkets threatened to sack staff who stayed at home during the Covid-19 pandemic, a move that may have pressured vulnerable workers into shifts at a factory where social distancing has not been observed.Workers at a north London plant run by the food group Bakkavor, which supplies the likes of Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Waitrose, were told they would be first in line for future redundancies if they missed work when they were not sick – even though some may have underlying health conditions or family members displaying symptoms.The comments were made during a presentation given last week to staff by Sean Madden, Bakkavor’s head of operations at its Elveden site, which was secretly filmed and then shared with the  and ITV News.Madden told workers that the pandemic meant the company was struggling because of falling orders and labour shortages, and suggested that the majority of people taking time off work were not suffering from the virus.The video, which clearly shows workers seated less than the two metres apart recommended by the government, depicts Madden telling staff: “If we need to get rid of 200 people’s jobs next month, I’m going to look at who turned up to work and I’m going to look at who didn’t bother turning up to work. The people who didn’t bother turning up to work, you know, they will be the first people that we have to get rid of, unfortunately.”The same messages were then repeated in Hindi for the benefit of workers who did not speak English. Bakkavor has since apologised and said that Madden is now on “leave”.Some workers have told the  and ITV News that they have felt under pressure to attend work at the Elveden site.A Bakkavor spokesman said: “We take this very seriously and are investigating the matter. We apologise to our Elveden staff for any miscommunication or worry caused. The manager in question has been given leave and prior to his return to work, he will undertake further training around his role and responsibilities and the high standards we expect of a Bakkavor manager.“Our advice to all our staff is to stay at home if they are feeling unwell or believe they have symptoms or if they are self-isolating due to members of their household displaying symptoms – points that were communicated at the staff briefing you have footage from.“We are saddened and concerned to hear today that a few colleagues feel under pressure to come to work and we’re putting protocols in place to speak to all staff at their next shift to make it absolutely clear that no colleague should come to work if they feel unwell, are self-isolating or if a family member is unwell.” Andre Marques, a London organiser at the GMB union, which has members on the Elveden site, said: “This behaviour is absolutely shocking. It is beyond unacceptable to threaten workers with the sack just for trying to keep themselves and their families safe.Bakkavor said that multi-tubes were just one measure in a range of “further controls” to make its sites safer, including the introduction of visors. It said it previously had in place “wide-ranging safety measures” and had not made, or had plans to make, any redundancies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27e4e319c760147399c22752190e20e8ab92e70f/0_265_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3abe0507e0fed6116bbcb76ba68c3707","title":"opec russia reduce oil production prop up prices","story":"Opec countries and allies led by Russia have agreed in principle to cut their oil output by more than a fifth and said they expected the United States and other producers to join in their effort to prop up prices hammered in the coronavirus crisis.But there was some confusion after Mexico apparently refused to sign up to its share of cuts under the deal, which would have been 400,000 barrels per day. The Mexican energy minister Rocio Nahle Garcia tweeted that her country had suggested a cut of 100,000 barrels.An unprecedented 15m bpd cut still would not remove enough crude to stop the world’s storage facilities quickly filling up. And far from signalling any readiness to offer support, the US president, Donald Trump, has threatened Opec with sanctions if it does not fix the oil market’s problem of oversupply.Trump, who has said US output was already falling due to low prices, warned Riyadh it could face tariffs on its oil if it did not cut enough to help the US oil industry, whose higher costs have left it struggling with low prices.A White House aide said Trump had held a call with Russian president Vladimir Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia after a US official said the move by Opec+ sent an “important signal” to the market.Both Opec and Russian officials have said the scale of the crisis required involvement of all producers.“We are expecting other producers outside the Opec+ club to join the measures, which might happen tomorrow, during G20,” Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia’s wealth fund and one of Moscow’s top oil negotiators, told Reuters.Thursday’s Opec+ talks will be followed by a call on Friday between energy ministers from the G20 major economies, hosted by Saudi Arabia. Brent oil prices, which hit an 18-year low last month, were around $32 a barrel on Thursday, half their level at the end of 2019. Sources said the cuts would be gradual, as the group seeks to overcome resistance from the United States, whose involvement they see as vital to a deal. US officials have already said output would fall naturally over two years.The United States, whose output has surged to surpass Saudi and Russian production since it began large-scale fracking, was invited to Thursday’s Opec+ talks, but it was not clear whether it had joined the video conference. Brazil, Norway and Canada were also invited.In a sign that Opec+ was struggling to win broader support, Canada’s main oil province, Alberta, said output had already dropped and that it had not been asked by Opec for more cuts. The province said it backed the US idea for tariffs on imported crude.

The beauty of blaming “China” lies in its ambiguity. Are critics merely condemning the way the Communist party concealed information during those crucial January weeks? Both liberals and conservatives in the US, including Donald Trump, have used this defence.Or, is the clear subtext that the real culprits are the “Chinese people” and their exotic culture and habits? Leave it to Nigel Farage to clumsily play both sides, claiming both that he held “no ill-will against the Chinese people” but that the problem lay with “appalling hygiene conditions in Chinese wildlife markets” and the customary diet of bats and pangolins. Whatever the intentions, we now see how criticisms of “China” have translated into an upsurge of racist violence aimed at the Chinese and Asian diaspora living in the US, western Europe and Oceania.I applaud the liberal condemnation of these attacks as xenophobic, but also worry that vague cries of tolerance for “Chinese people” and “culture” play into the racist framing of the right, in which we wind up debating identity and difference at the expense of dynamic historical processes. Any serious attempt to grapple with China’s role in this pandemic must also consider the specific political-economic conditions of China’s ascent within the global market in recent years, which facilitated the virus’s spread as well as planting the seeds for an Euro-American backlash.Let’s take the claim that the novel coronavirus was caused by a culturally peculiar fondness for eating pangolins. Though it is true that pangolin scales and meat are advertised as a sort of folk medicine in mainland China, statistics suggest the real key variable are the effects of globalisation, which have enriched the country’s business classes. Prices for the animal have climbed from $14 a kilo in 1994 to more than $600 today, while illegal shipments confiscated at the border regularly exceed 10 tonnes. Customers ordering wildlife often do so in order to flaunt their wealth or to celebrate a good day on the stock market, although they remain a minority: most Chinese citizens support strict limits, if not a ban, on wildlife consumption. Resurgent pangolin consumption is thus a result of economic liberalisation in China – which the US championed – not simply of traditional culture.It was these same economic forces that also hastened the spread of the virus overseas. Wuhan, where the virus originated, originally served as a hub between coastal metropolises, such as Guangzhou and Shanghai, and inland China. Although considered a “second-tier” city, even Wuhan has been caught up in the latest phase of globalisation, as capital pursues cheaper land and labour markets inland. During February and March cases of the novel coronavirus illuminated economic linkages long hidden from view, such as Chinese investments into infrastructure in Qom, Iran or the ties between Wuhan’s car parts industry and factories in Serbia, South Korea and Germany. The coronavirus may have first appeared in China, but the ensuing spread and crisis also belong to the global assemblages of commerce, tourism, and supply chains erected by powerful interests in the 21st century.The great irony of blaming some vague notion of Chinese culture is that the best responses to the pandemic have come from the ethnic Chinese majority governments of Taiwan (five deaths, 380 cases), Singapore (six1,910), and Hong Kong (four974). Yes, their responsible policies were due largely to the trauma of the 2003 Sars epidemic but also have to do with the history of robust welfare states in East Asia, which, unlike Europe and the US, have increasingly invested in healthcare infrastructure to deal with precisely such crises.To push back on the anti-China line is not to apologise or defend the state’s actions. It is clear that local officials were wrong to silence Dr Li Wenliang, who alerted friends about the virus as early as possible, and that the government has consistently downplayed the virus’s contagiousness and the severity of deaths.But is the contrast between authoritarian and democratic regimes so stark, as western ideologues allege? Most observers agree that China covered up the crisis in Wuhan for three weeks in January, and this lost time probably decided the difference between a local versus a global epidemic. Nevertheless, it is still sobering to read reports that even from mid-January other governments took even longer to respond: the UK dragged its feet for an interminable eight weeks and the US ignored clear warning signs for 70 days.This inactivity was partly the product of a western exceptionalism that believed viruses and epidemics only happen “over there”, in poor and non-white countries. This is a crucial point for challenging anti-Asian racism. Rather than debate the blame game, as Justice is Global director Tobita Chow has written, we should point out how short-sighted nationalist perspectives have produced fatally ineffective responses. During Italy’s worst weeks, officials admitted they initially viewed the Wuhan crisis as a “science-fiction movie that had nothing to do with us”. In the US, a Kansas politician stated that his town was safe because it had only a few Chinese residents. In Philadelphia, in a more tragic offshoot of racial thinking, rumours circulated that the virus could not infect black Americans because it was a Chinese disease, misinformation that officials now fear exacerbated inequalities.Ultimately, both the pandemic and the accompanying anti-Asian backlash are dynamics that go beyond questions of culture and xenophobia, carrying serious life-and-death consequences. Both are the indirect byproducts of China’s emergence as a major force in global capitalism, not only forging the supply chains and travel networks that conveyed the virus but also threatening Euro-America’s centuries-long economic and political prestige.In the US, such fears were already manifest in populist claims that China alone – and not the domestic political and business class – was to blame for the loss of manufacturing jobs. In the wake of a referendum result seen as a vote against globalisation, anxieties in the UK have recently been manifest in panic over Huawei providing the country’s 5G network. Fears over China were not created by coronavirus, but find in it a most apt metaphor, as a global and invisible force of destruction.It follows that these dangerous sentiments will not automatically disappear when a vaccine is created, unless we demand more than liberal appeals for tolerance. We need to also recognise and confront the political-economic forces behind the west’s anti-China backlash – and the inadequacy of nationalism in responding to the social and public health crises facing us today, which are global in scale.• Andrew Liu is an assistant professor of history at Villanova University and the author of Tea War: A History of Capitalism in China and India"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/493ec66c56e5172c1b6feae37878c9ab4517f496/0_28_3059_1836/master/3059.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1987c3c4b2b259239e2db0fde3d106da","title":"modelling pandemic politicians decisions science","story":"It’s convenient for leaders to say they are following the science, but technical evidence can only take us so farOn the Andrew Marr Show last Sunday, speaking about Covid-19, Prof Neil Ferguson was described as being “more influential right now than any politician”. Ferguson leads a team of modellers at Imperial College London whose mission has been to predict the pattern and health impact of coronavirus transmission in the UK under different scenarios, and thereby help government make the right decisions about how best to protect the population.The UK has some of the best infectious disease modellers in the world, and the government has been wise to draw upon their expertise. But all models have their limitations, and none can avoid the fact that decision-making must also be informed by people with relevant expertise and experience, and by the facts on the ground. In the case of Covid-19, where so much about the disease and its transmission dynamics is still unknown or unclear, models are useful – but experience and sound judgment are crucial.This is becoming apparent across the world. Countries that lived through the experience of Sars and Mers appear to have been better prepared to deal with Covid-19 than those that didn’t. And in Canada, the success of British Columbia in controlling Covid-19 compared with other provinces has been partly attributable to the combined ingredients of political experience and good judgment.There is also a non-scientific element to decision-making which involves choosing between competing demands and needs in society, determining what is ethical and moral, and balancing challenges that are current and immediate with those that will only emerge in the future. For example, a model that incorporates value judgments is needed to balance the direct, visible and dramatic harms of Covid-19 with the more indirect, chronic and hidden social and economic harms of lockdown.Furthermore, while it is often said that Covid-19 “does not discriminate”, this statement is only partially true. The virus disproportionately affects older people and men and we can be sure that the effects of both the virus and the collateral damage of control measures will disproportionately affect the poorer and more marginalised segments of society. How we manage this differentiated vulnerability is all about ethics and politics. It may be informed by a scientific model, but it shouldn’t be disguised as a technocratic problem that can be resolved by mathematical equations.It is easy to be entranced by the cleverness of models that map, measure and predict the complex interactions of multiple natural and social variables. There is something impressive about the ability to produce answers in the form of precisely calculated numbers, and professionally crafted charts and graphs. And for politicians, nothing is more convenient than being able to say that they are merely following “the science” and evidence.While Marr’s comment about Ferguson being the most influential person in the country was rhetorical, it hints at the perception that epidemiological modelling has played a disproportionately influential role in shaping the UK’s strategy and plans. Others have pointed out that some of the earlier modelling work had gaps that have adversely affected policy decisions. These include not accounting for the potential role of testing and contact tracing in mitigating the epidemic not modelling the impact of sick patients on intensive care beds and other parts of the health system and not modelling the epidemic across different regions of the UK.It is not clear what caused these omissions. Perhaps they were the result of blindspots that persisted due to the lack of external scrutiny and challenge. In the case of the sidelining of testing and contact tracing, perhaps it was because the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) had concluded that these measures were not worth while – a view that is understandable if Sage also saw the building up of herd immunity through natural infection as part of its strategy.There has been lots of speculation as to why the UK delayed lockdown compared with other countries why it was slow to increase viral testing capacity and why the NHS was left so poorly prepared. Now is not the time to look backwards. Neither would I want to place any criticism on modellers. Rigorous modelling is done by clever modellers but the design and testing of models, including the assumptions built into models and the questions that modellers have been asked to help answer, is a collective responsibility.Modelling is vital and could assist greatly in going forward. In particular, two things should be urgently modelled. The first is to model the impact of different strategies that will help us avoid the harms of draconian, population-wide lockdown. This should include modelling the costs and benefits of weekly viral testing of the whole population (not 100,000 tests a day, but 10 million tests a day), or a more modest but greatly expanded testing regime, combined with aggressive case detection and contact tracing, coupled with continued physical distancing and improved hygiene. The former idea may sound radical and extreme, but is a serious proposal that could be implemented if there was sufficient political will.Second, we must model (and then keep monitoring) the health and socioeconomic impacts of both the virus and the control measures, with short-, medium- and long-term timeframes, and with a social lens to look at how the virus has impacted differentially across society. For some reason, there was no modelling of the socioeconomic impact of lockdown. This was an omission – and as we enter the beginning of what could be a global economic recession, we could see thousands of lives cut short from this collateral damage.Finally, from a policymaking perspective, there are two things needed. First, we need greater transparency and participation to allow effective scrutiny and challenge from scientists and public health specialists who are more independent of government. This will avoid the danger of groupthink and blindspots. Second, we must better acknowledge the limitations of evidence-based policy and recognise the importance of expertise, experience and sound judgment.• David McCoy is a professor of Global Public Health and director of the Centre for Public Health at Queen Mary University of London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38fda813e25e25d19b49fbfe2503307f3e96ce96/0_145_4352_2614/master/4352.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cf36a82e999d698ac44c4652ca1b18c","title":"sunbathing park deep moral questions philosophers coronavirus individual","story":"Coronavirus gives fresh urgency to philosophers’ struggle with the conflict between inidual choice and the common goodSunbathing in the park, normally the most innocent of pleasures, is causing outrage. The police are involved the parks may be shut.Lockdown is never easy, but when the weather is good, the urge to be outside, to feel the sun on your face, to lie on the grass, under a tree, is almost irresistible. To close your eyes and pretend just for a little while that life is normal. How can this be wrong?Extreme libertarians think it is not. They say that freedom is so important that losing it is worse than death (other people’s deaths, at any rate). Most of us don’t agree. We accept the need for social distancing. But even so, the lockdown rules don’t require us to stay in all the time. There are exceptions. Why not just one more, just for me, my family, our suntan cream and picnic basket? If my local park is empty, my family and I can enjoy our picnic  in the open air. We refresh ourselves and don’t harm anyone else – they chose to stay at home anyway. What could possibly be wrong with that?Moral and political philosophers have long struggled with the conflict between inidual choice and the common good, between general rules and exceptions, and have come to very different conclusions about the right answer.It is plainly rational, game theorists say, to make some people better off (me and my family) and no one worse off (everyone else). Some moral philosophers have thought it morally right too. According to utilitarians, rules are made to be broken, when you make people happier by breaking them. Our fundamental moral duty, John Stuart Mill said, is to produce the greatest happiness of the greatest number. In the time of coronavirus, that means staying away from other people.But if you can do that while making yourself happier – by sunbathing or picnicking, because everyone else has obeyed the lockdown – it is not just permitted but actually morally right to go for it. Of course, seeing my family reclining outdoors may send onlookers into a righteous fury, reducing the total happiness (though righteous fury can be pretty enjoyable too). Also we may inspire others to break the rules themselves, and if everyone thinks this way, the park will be full. That is dangerous for us all and it would be better to stay at home. But all this means is that I ought to be discreet. If I am, no harm, no wrong.Can that really be true? Immanuel Kant thought the fundamental moral question was a different one: what if everyone did that? Kant thought it was right to act only in ways that could be a universal law. We know that if everyone picnicked in the park, no one could do so safely. When I do it anyway, I am acting in a way that could not be for everyone. I am relying on everyone else abiding by the rules, exploiting their conformity to benefit myself. I am treating myself as an exception, a special case. This is not a way of treating other people with respect. This is not fair.If we accept that morality is not only a matter of harm and benefit, but also respect and fairness, we can see what is wrong with picnicking in the park at the present time. But once we start to think in these terms, we need to look at a much broader picture. As political philosophers such as Karl Marx emphasise, our inidual decisions are made against a social background that we have not chosen. Lockdown is a very different experience for different people, depending on their personality, their family circumstances and their living conditions. It is easier to stay at home in a large, roomy house with a pleasant garden than in a cramped high-rise flat with no outdoor space.Lockdown reinforces existing social inequalities. It is even less excusable for the more fortunate to break the rules. Though we should all keep to the guidelines, it doesn’t follow that we should heap blame on those who don’t, not knowing what staying at home is like for them, not knowing their reasons for being out. Of course they should comply, but be kind most people are doing their best.It is a mark of the crisis we are in that simply sunbathing in the park raises the deepest questions about what truly matters in our lives: the happiness of all, even if I rely on others obeying the rules, as utilitarians would say. Or respect and fairness, as Kant would reply. The role of inidual responsibility within a social context, as Marx would insist.Finally, we can draw on another value very important to Marx (and Rousseau and Hegel too): the value of solidarity. There are huge disparities between the burdens a few are being asked to bear for the sake of the many. Doctors, nurses and other key workers constantly risk their lives to look after the sick and to keep essential services running. For the rest of us, there is very little that we can do to make a difference in this global crisis. It is easy to feel helpless and overwhelmed. But in fact, sitting at home, we can stand in solidarity with those who are doing more. We are doing our part, and treating fairly everyone else who is doing the same. It is the most, and the least, we can do.• Alison Hills is a fellow and tutor in philosophy at St John’s College, University of Oxford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/675f5c3327a7913bec6a6290261af78e7a5e9902/0_0_3058_1860/master/3058.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64f7e3c68446ed29748de202504d3e51 940w","title":"recruitment is on hold the students graduating into the covid 19 recession","story":"Businesses are scaling back graduate recruitment, leading to fears of a ‘lost generation’ with limited optionsJustine Tanomjit, a commercial law student at Aberystwyth University, was headhunted for a job as an insurance broker that would have begun in June. Two weeks ago she got a call saying the interview was cancelled. “I feel so sad and frustrated. I’d been nervous about leaving uni and getting an interview was really exciting,” she says.Many are in similar positions. Alice Cole (not her real name) is in her final year at the University of Brighton and wanted to go into the NGO sector as a researcher. She was feeling confident about her prospects after graduation and there were jobs available, but the outlook has changed rapidly. “Because of coronavirus, funding for NGOs is getting smaller and there are fewer jobs at entry-level positions,” she says. “It won’t be possible anymore.”Students are starting to realise they will be graduating into a global recession. According to the Institute of Student Employers (ISE), many firms have scaled down their recruitment of entry-level staff and more than a quarter of businesses are reducing the number of graduates they hire this year.While some firms are moving assessments and interviews online, the majority have cancelled them. “Thousands of young people are supposed to be entering the labour market from July and they could be left without work and nothing to do while coronavirus is sorted out,” says Stephen Isherwood, chief executive of the ISE. “We need to make sure that a whole generation isn’t lost.”One graduate recruiter says they have already retracted offers. “Firms are being realistic and most are putting recruitment on hold. No one wants to offer an opportunity which might not be there in three months’ time.”James Turner, CEO of the Sutton Trust, says although we don’t know the full extent of the virus on the graduate job market yet, shrinking opportunities tend to be bad for social mobility, with students unable to access internships and other work experience placements. He says: “Internships are increasingly necessary for many graduate jobs, and there is a risk that young people with professional connections may be able to find work experience while other, openly-advertised, opportunities cease to exist.”Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says although most companies will feel the impact, there will be some big winners and some losers depending on the sector. “Even in this crisis, some employers are booming. Technology companies, the food sector and logistics firms are busier than ever,” he says. “You might not end up with the job you hoped for but you can get a job.”Students can also rely on their university careers’ services, and Kim Connor Streich, marketing director of the Debut Careers app, thinks it is vital that applicants practice video interviews and presenting on camera.Others, however, think we will see more students deciding to take master’s degrees or further courses of study. In other times of recession, staying on at university has been a good alternative to struggling to get a job, with the hope that iniduals will emerge not only with improved skills but into a recovering jobs market. Cole thinks this is her only option. “I live in a rural area of Wales so there are very few job opportunities around here. I’m currently looking into doing a master’s,” she says. “The easiest thing to do right now is to delay entering the job market by a year so things have a chance to get back to normal.”James Catchpole, director of the legal practice course at the City Law School, thinks the end result may be a more highly skilled workforce. “We need to make sure we prepare them even better than we have done and turn them into even better candidates,” he says.Hillman agrees. “You can get government-backed loans for postgraduate study, and unis will be falling over themselves to recruit home students as international numbers will be down significantly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/669d023f8a762c57e7bdb18b674a40a4db94d857/0_164_2496_1498/master/2496..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49e9222928423a568112fe77e2fed41d","title":"bamboo rats left in limbo as breeders push back against china wildlife ban","story":"Farms forced to shut down operations as search continues for source of Covid-19 amid uncertainty over new industry rules Just a few months ago Cheng Yongcai ran a thriving farm that produced 20,000 bamboo rats a year in Qingyuan in northern Guangdong province.It was an operation that his local government actively encouraged with loans and other support, he says.But the Covid-19 outbreak, widely suspected of originating in China’s huge wildlife industry supply chain, has led to a complete halt in Yongcai’s operation, now shut indefinitely while he awaits final rules on what will be allowed once the crisis is over.China put in place a temporary ban on all wildlife trading and consumption in late February. But a final determination as to what will be legal or illegal after years of lacklustre regulation has been postponed until authorities in Beijing can get a handle on the human side of the outbreak.“We hope to transition to other types of business but until it’s clear what to do with the rats, it’s easier said than done,” he said. “We would need funding and the right facility for that.”Like Yongcai, many other wildlife farmers are increasingly irked by the bans on the trade, in place since late January. They argue that they are being unfairly blamed when no evidence has been provided by the Chinese government pinpointing the exact source of the outbreak.Certain types of bats and pangolins have been identified by epidemiological studies as natural carriers of the Sars-Cov-2 viruses that spawned Covid-19. But it is still unclear how likely either of these are to have been the source. Meanwhile, other animals such as civet cats, bamboo rats and several kinds of rodents have been shown to be carriers of coronaviruses.The problem is that the regulation and oversight of the sector has been confusing. The last updated catalogue of terrestrial wildlife approved for breeding by Chinese authorities that the  could find, which appears to be dated 2008, includes civet cats. But it does not include pangolins, bats, or bamboo rats.“Somehow these were still allowed by the forestry authorities,” Yin said.Recently, the industry association that lobbies for farming bamboo rats has called for the government to continue allowing the animals to be bred, arguing that they have been encouraged for years and have not been found to be the source of the Covid-19 outbreak.The group declined to comment about its appeal to lift the ban when contacted by the  on 3 April.“Of course, it’s a bit unfair, because for people in the rural areas, this is a very profitable business,” Yongcai said. “You don’t need to invest a lot, you don’t cause much pollution and you only have to feed them bamboo and grass.”Gao Guanxing, a farmer in a village near Heyuan, Guangdong, was one of thousands who went into wildlife breeding in recent years as part of China’s efforts to alleviate poverty by the end of 2020. In 2016 he started to rear bamboo rats, and he was among farmers feted by officials from nearby Shenzhen and the local government.But now those same local officials are attempting to persuade 230 families who went into breeding bamboo rats, wild boar, snakes, civet cats, frogs and Sika deer to turn to other forms of commerce: brewing, raising chickens, digging fish ponds, with compensation available of up to £23,000 per operation.Guanxing has been encouraged to go into mushroom farming. “After the two old bamboo rat houses are cleaned and disinfected, they will become a three-dimensional mushroom farm,” he told state-run financial newspaper Yicai, adding that once his mushrooms are planted and growing he’ll be able to produce 50kg per day. Attempts to reach Guanxing directly were not successful.Yongcai is in a more difficult position as his farm wasn’t officially part of a poverty alleviation programme, so it is uncertain whether he’ll qualify for compensation or additional assistance to switch to another form of production.“We’ve heard how the Heyuan government is helping breeders there to take up other business such as growing mushrooms and raising chickens, but that’s just for the impoverished household breeders,” Yongcai said. “For regular breeders, we’re still on our own and awaiting a decision.”What is unknown is what will happen once the government finally decides how to regulate the wildlife industry. Officials have discussed moving certain forms of wildlife that are not endangered or protected, nor known potential sources of zoonotic disease, to a list that would allow them to be bred under rules usually meant for poultry and livestock. No comprehensive list for those changes has been released.Theoretically, these rules from the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs would provide for safer operations, with those continuing in the business required to have larger-scale operations and biosecurity measures to prevent disease transfer.Yet, as has been seen in the outbreaks of African swine fever among China’s pig farms in recent years, which led to the deaths of millions of swine through the disease and culling, even those measures continue to fail to contain the spread of disease.“I don’t think bamboo rats pose that big a threat,” he said. “Plus, there’s no conclusion yet on where the new coronavirus is from.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7f53031009cc0ea635fc37a53985ba90f7e53d4/0_231_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8e5250b48074554448be7820275f9d9e","title":"coronavirus may prove boost for uks bees and rare wildflowers","story":"Populations could recover as verges are left uncut, setting what conservationists hope will be a long-term trendRare wildflowers and declining bee populations could start to recover during the coronavirus lockdown because many councils are leaving roadside verges uncut, according to Europe’s biggest conservation charity for wild plants.The respite for these mini-meadows is likely to lead to an explosion of colour in the countryside this summer and bring benefits to other pollinators, including butterflies, birds and bats, botanists at Plantlife said.Their potential role as conservation areas, however, is normally undermined each spring by local councils when they mow the roadsides. This cuts down many plants before they can flower and seed, leading to a steady decline of oxeye daisy, yellow rattle, wild carrot, meadow crane’s-bill, greater knapweed, white campion, burnet-saxifrage, betony, harebell and field scabious.Plantlife says this may be the best summer for years for these plants because several councils are redistributing resources to other activities as a result of the pandemic.Flintshire, Lincolnshire, Newcastle, Norfolk and Somerset are among the growing number of councils that are scaling back or delaying their verge mowing operations. Some local authorities, such as Devon, had already begun to accept that this should be done later and less frequently.Trevor Dines, Plantlife’s botanical specialist, said this could be a silver lining to the coronavirus crisis. “It’s a real opportunity for verges to flower again, some for the first time,” he said. “If the lockdown ends in late May, drivers will see great swaths of oxeye daisies and ladies bedstraw.”Grass near junctions and sight lines needs to be trimmed more regularly for safety reasons, but he said most stretches of road can be left until much later in the year so that motorists can see the benefits outweigh the risks. “Our message to councils is that if you haven’t cut verges until now then leave them until August and gauge the response from the public,” he said.Kate Petty, the group’s road verge campaign manager, said the extraordinary short-term circumstances of the pandemic could help to shift opinion and policies with long-term benefits for threatened species such as wood-calamint.“The fix is startlingly straightforward. Simply cutting verges less and later will save plants, money and reduce emissions. We need to rewild ourselves and accept nature’s wonderful ‘messiness’,” she said.Dines, who is also a beekeeper, said later and less frequent verge-mowing would help other species that depend on wildflowers.“This will certainly be good for pollinators. Last year, we already saw improvement in the areas where councils were cutting less. I had my best ever year for honey,” he said. “It’s also good for mental health. People are desperate for wildlife and colour right now. Let’s see what the public response is. For lots of commuters, myself included, verges are the only chance to see wild plants.”This year will almost certainly see much lower levels of wildlife roadkill. Past estimates suggest cars and trucks in the UK killed about 100,000 hedgehogs, 100,000 foxes, 50,000 badgers, 30,000 deer a year as well as barn owls and many other species of bird and insect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af44f49e5d3d666b954b2598071afbe801f34779/0_0_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4e7a5e698e5f816181631a5f0ecc65a","title":"the secret call of the wild how animals teach each other to survive aoe","story":"Cultural knowledge, passed from animal to animal, is key to how species adapt to change in the world around themSam Williams’ Macaw Recovery Network in Costa Rica rewilds captivity-hatched fledgling scarlet and great green macaws. But introducing young birds into a complex forest world – bereft of the cultural education normally provided by parents – is slow and risky.For 30 years or so scientists have referred to the ersity of life on Earth as “biological ersity”, or just “bioersity”. They usually define bioersity as operating at three levels: the ersity of genes within any particular species the ersity of species in a given place and the ersity of habitat types such as forests, coral reefs, and so on. But does that cover it? Not really. A fourth level has been almost entirely overlooked: cultural ersity.Culture is knowledge and skills that flow socially from inidual to inidual and generation to generation. It’s not in genes. Socially learned skills, traditions and dialects that answer the question of “how we live here” are crucial to helping many populations survive – or recover. Crucially, culturally learned skills vary from place to place. In the human family many cultures, underappreciated, have been lost. Culture in the other-than-human world has been almost entirely missed.We are just recognising that in many species, survival skills must be learned from elders who learned from their elders. Until now, culture has remained a largely hidden, unrecognised layer of wild lives. Yet for many species culture is both crucial and fragile. Long before a population declines to numbers low enough to seem threatened with extinction, their special cultural knowledge, earned and passed down over long generations, begins disappearing. Recovery of lost populations then becomes much more difficult than bringing in a few iniduals and turning them loose.Many young birds learn much by observing their parents, and parrots probably need to learn more than most. Survival of released iniduals is severely undermined if there are no free-living elder role models. Trying to restore parrot populations by captive breeding is not as easy as training young or orphaned creatures to recognise what is food while they’re in the safety of a cage – then simply opening the door. “In a cage,” Williams says, “you can’t train them to know where, when and how to find that food, or about trees with good nest sites.” Parents would normally have done exactly that.A generational break in cultural traditions hampered attempts to reintroduce thick-billed parrots to parts of south-west America, where they’d been wiped out. Conservation workers could not teach the captive-raised parrots to search for and find their traditional wild foods, skills they would have learned from parents.Landscapes, always complex, are under accelerated change. Culture enables adaptation far faster than genes alone can navigate hairpin turns in time. In some places, pigeons and sparrows have learned to use motion-sensors to get inside enclosed shopping malls and forage for crumbs. Crows have in some locales learned to drop nuts on the road for cars to crack. In at least one area they do this at intersections, so they can safely walk out and collect their cracked prizes when the light turns red and the cars stop. They’ve developed answers to the new question: “How can we survive here, in this never-before world?”Because the answers are local, and learned from elders, wild cultures can be lost faster than genetic ersity. When populations plummet, traditions that helped animals survive and adapt to a place begin to vanish.In a scientific article on the vocabulary of larks living in north Africa and Spain titled, “Erosion of animal cultures in fragmented landscapes”, researchers reported that as human development shrinks habitats into patches, “isolation is associated with impoverishment”. They write: “Song repertoires pass through a cultural bottleneck and significantly decline in variety.”Unfortunately, isolated larks are not an isolated case. Researchers studying South America’s orange-billed sparrow found that sparrow “song complexity” – the number of syllables per song and song length – deteriorated as humans continued whittling their forests into fragments. When a scientist replayed 24-year-old recordings of singing male white-crowned sparrows at the same location she’d recorded them, they elicited half the responses they had when first recorded. The birds’ responses show that changes in the dialect lead to changes in listener preference, a bit analogous to pop music. And as with humans, preferences can affect whether a particular bird will be accepted as a mate. White-crowned sparrows singing a local dialect become fathers of more offspring than do singers of unfamiliar dialects, indicating females prefer a familiar tune.I’m not just talking about a few songs. Survival of numerous species depends on cultural adaptation. How many? We’re just beginning to ask such questions. But the preliminary answers indicate surprising and widespread ways that animals survive by cultural learning. Regionally different vocalisations are sometimes called “song traditions” but the more commonly used word is “dialects”. More than a hundred studies have been published on dialects in birds. And it’s not just birds but a wide array of animals Including some fish.“Cod particularly,” said Steve Simpson of the University of Exeter, “have very elaborate calls compared with many fish.” You can easily hear differences in recorded calls of American and European Atlantic cod. “This species is highly vocal with traditional breeding grounds established over hundreds or even thousands of years.” Many fish follow elders to feeding, resting and breeding areas. In experiments, introduced outsiders who learned such preferred locales by following elders continued to use these traditional routes after all the original fish from whom they learned were gone.Cultural survival skills erode as habitats shrink. Maintaining genetic ersity is not enough. We’ve become accustomed to a perilous satisfaction with precariously minimal populations that not only risk genetic viability of populations but almost guarantee losing local cultural knowledge by which populations have lived and survived.In all free-living parrots that have been studied, nestlings develop inidually unique calls, learned from their parents. Researchers have described this as “an intriguing parallel with human parents naming infants”. Indeed, these vocal identities help iniduals distinguish neighbours, mates, sexes and iniduals the same functions that human names serve.Williams tells me that when he studied Amazon parrots, he could hear differences between them saying, essentially, “Let’s go”, “I’m here, where are you?” and “Darling, I just brought breakfast”. Researchers who develop really good ears for parrot vocalisation and use technology to study recordings show that parrot noise is more organised and meaningful than it sounds to beginners like me. In a study of budgerigars, for instance, birds who were unfamiliar with each other were placed together. Groups of unfamiliar females took a few weeks for their calls to converge and sound similar. Males copied the calls of females. Black-capped chickadees flock members’ calls converge, so they can distinguish members of their own flock from those of other flocks. The fact that this happens, and that it takes weeks, suggests that free-living groups must normally be stable, that groups have their own identity, and that the members identify with their group.Group identity, we see repeatedly, is not exclusively human. Sperm whales learn and announce their group identity. Young fruit bats learn the dialects of the crowds they’re in. Ravens know who’s in, who’s out. Too many animals to list know what group, troop, family or pack they belong with. In Brazil, some dolphins drive fish toward fishermen’s nets for a share of the catch. Other dolphins don’t. The ones who do, sound different from the ones who don’t. Various dolphin groups who specialise in a food-getting technique won’t socialise with other groups who use different techniques. And orca whales, the most socially complex non-humans, have layered societies of pods, clans and communities, with community members all knowing the members of all their constituent pods, but each community scrupulously avoiding contact with members of another community. All this social organisation is learned from elders.Elders appear important for social learning of migratory routes. Various storks, vultures, eagles and hawks all depend on following the cues of elders to locate strategic migration flyways or important stopover sites. These could be called their migration cultures. Famously, conservationists have raised young cranes, geese and swans to follow microlight aircraft as a surrogate parent on first migrations. Without such enculturation, they would not have known where to go. The young birds absorbed knowledge of routes, then used them in later seasons on their own self-guided migrations. Four thousand species of birds migrate, so Andrew Whiten of the University of St Andrews in Scotland speculates that following experienced birds may be an underappreciated but “very significant realm of cultural transmission”.When you look at free-living animals, you don’t usually see culture. Culture makes itself visible when it gets disrupted. Then we see that the road back to reestablishing cultures – the answers to the questions of “how we live in this place” – is difficult, often fatal.Young mammals too – moose, bison, deer, antelope, wild sheep, ibex and many others – learn crucial migration routes and destinations from elder keepers of traditional knowledge. Conservationists have recently reintroduced large mammals in a few areas where they’ve been wiped out, but because animals released into unfamiliar landscapes don’t know where food is, where dangers lurk, or where to go in changing seasons, many translocations have failed.Williams describes his procedure with the macaws as “very much a slow release”. First his team trains the birds to use a feeder. With that safety net, they can explore the forest, gain local knowledge, begin dispersing and using wild foods.Some rescue programmes declare success if a released animal survives one year. “A year is meaningless for a bird like a macaw that doesn’t mature until it’s eight years old,” says Williams.I ask what they’re doing for those eight long years.“Social learning,” Williams replies immediately. “Working out who’s who, how to interact, like kids in school.”To gain access to the future, to mate and to raise young, the birds Williams is releasing must enter into the culture of their kind. But from whom will they learn, if no one is out there? At the very least they must be socially oriented to one another. Ex-pets are the worst candidates for release they don’t interact appropriately with other macaws, and they want to hang around near humans. To assess the social abilities of 13 scarlet macaws who were scheduled for release, Williams and his crew documented how much time they spent close to another bird, how often they initiated aggression, things like that. When the bird scoring lowest for social skills was released, he flew out the door and was never seen again. The next-to-lowest didn’t adapt to the free-living life and had to be retrieved. The third-lowest social scorer remained at liberty but stayed alone a lot. The rest did well.All of the above adds up to this: a species isn’t just one big jar of jellybeans of the same colour. It’s different smaller jars with differing hues in different places. From region to region, genetics can vary. And cultural traditions can differ. Different populations might use different tools, different migration routes, different ways of calling, courting and being understood. All populations have their answers to the question of how to live where they live.“Sometimes a group will be foraging in a tree,” Williams says. “A pair will fly overhead on a straight path. Someone will make a contact call, and the flying birds will loop around and land with the callers. They seem to have their friends.” Bottom line, said Williams, there is much going on in the social and cultural lives of his macaws and other species, much that they understand – but we don’t. We have a lot of questions. The answers must lurk, somewhere, in their minds.As land, weather and climate change, some aspects of cultural knowledge will be the tickets necessary for boarding the future. Others will die out. Across the range of chimpanzees, cultures vary greatly, as do habitats. All populations but one use stick tools. Some use simple probes, others fashion multi-stick toolsets. Only one population makes pointed daggers for hunting small nocturnal primates called bush-babies hiding in tree holes. Only the westernmost chimpanzees crack nuts with stones.As researchers have noted, distinctive tool-using traditions at particular sites are defining features of unique chimpanzee cultures. Whiten wrote: “Chimpanzee communities resemble human cultures in possessing suites of local traditions that uniquely identify them … A complex social inheritance system that complements the genetic picture.”Some chimpanzee populations have learned to track the progress of dozens of specific trees ripening in their dense forests. Others live in open semi-savannah. Some are more aggressively male-dominated, some populations more egalitarian. Some almost never see people some live in sight of human settlements and have learned to crop-raid at night. For a long, long time chimpanzees have been works in progress. “We’ve learned,” writes Craig Stanford, “not to speak of ‘The Chimpanzee’.” Chimpanzees vary and chimpanzee culture is variable at every level.“It’s not just the loss of populations of chimps that worries me,” Cat Hobaiter emphasised when I spent several weeks with her studying chimpanzees in Uganda. “I find terrifying the possibility of losing each population’s unique culture. That’s permanent.”Diversity in cultural pools – perhaps more crucially than in gene pools – will make species survival more likely. If pressures cause regional populations to blink out, a species’ odds of persisting dim.Williams’ goal is to re-establish macaws where they range no longer, in hopes that they, and their forests, will recover. (Most of the central American forests that macaws need have been felled and burned, largely so fast-food burger chains can sell cheap beef.) It often takes a couple of generations for human immigrant families to learn how to function effectively in their new culture it may take two or three generations before an introduced population of macaws succeeds. In other words, macaws are born to be wild. But becoming wild requires an education.So what’s at stake is not just numbers. What’s at stake is: ways of knowing how to be in the world. Culture isn’t just a boutique concern. Cultural knowledge is what allows many populations to survive. Keeping the knowledge of how to live in a habitat can be almost as important to the persistence of a species as keeping the habitat both are needed. Cultural ersity itself is a source of resilience and adaptability to change. And change is accelerating.This is an edited extract from Becoming Wild: How Animals Learn to be Animals by Carl Safina, which published in the UK by Oneworld on 9 April and in the US by Henry Holt and Co on 14 April"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/889a0e9cd96f3b3398a12f3c9f99ce983b0f6a13/0_397_5819_3491/master/5819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b6b3d9db909b68b6d211cbbb7494797","title":"scottish fishermen turn to food banks as covid 19 devastates industry","story":"Crisis destroys foreign sales of shellfish and supermarkets close fish counters causing slump during traditional Easter boom periodScottish fishermen are turning to food banks and welfare organisations, as the coronavirus crisis has led to plummeting demand for seafood, leaving many unable to work to feed their families.Worst-hit are lobster and crab fishermen in Scotland’s south-east and west coasts, according to the Fishermen’s Mission, a Christian welfare charity. Staff at the charity have also identified “pockets of need” in Shetland and as far south as Newlyn in Cornwall. This comes just before the Easter holiday, traditionally a period of increased demand.Claire McIntosh, the Mission’s area official for south-east Scotland, has been working 12-hour days fielding calls from crews whose skippers have had to tie up their boats.“I’ve been liaising with food banks since January,” said McIntosh, whose patch covers the 80 miles of coastline from Seahouses in Northumberland to Port Seton in East Lothian. “This is on the back of poor weather and poor catches during winter. They are very self-sufficient folk, very resilient, resourceful and hard-working. Their last resort is to come to us. But I’ve handed out £17,500 in the last few weeks, compared to £12,000 for the whole of the last year.”“Langoustine, shrimp and prawn are almost impossible to get rid of and the demand for crab and lobster in China has just vaporised,” said David Dickens, the Mission’s chief executive. “When there’s a pandemic, people aren’t interested in high quality seafood.”The charity’s 71 staff across the UK are expecting things to get worse.“All the indications are we’re at the beginning of a curve of need,” said Dickens. “This is the calm before the storm. From Kirkcudbright in the south up as far as Mallaig, there’s a lot of very worried people. We’re planning for the worst, but hoping for the best. Our focus is keeping the lights on and keeping food on the table.”On 25 March, the Scottish government announced a £5m assistance package aimed at 650 seafood companies impacted by the collapse in the market for shellfish, and for owners of full-time registered vessels under 12 metres.Dickens welcomes the scheme, which is underway, but said he and his staff are supporting crew or skippers who are ineligible, including those working part time.A further £10m package for fish processing businesses was announced by the Scottish government on 3 April. A spokesperson said: “Work on the grant to processors is ongoing and we hope to open applications soon.”They added that further support is being made available, including a £2.2bn grant to help Scottish businesses pay staff and treat them fairly.Donna Fordyce, the interim head of trade marketing body Seafood Scotland, which is working on exploring other alternatives to get Scotland’s seafood to consumers, said: “It’s a pretty grim picture across the board. The seafood sector has been one of the hardest hit of all the sectors in Scotland, because of the level of exports. The market has more or less collapsed in Europe.”It was already a bad year for fishermen, she said, with the “worst weather we’ve seen for 15 years for fleets”, before the Covid-19 crisis hit.“The prawn and the scallop fleet are more or less all tied up,” said Fordyce. “The whitefish fleet, some are still going out.“It is going to be a UK market for the next few months.”Scotland has 2,089 registered vessels and 4,860 crew. Among those waiting to find out if they are eligible for the £10m fund for processors is Jamie McMillan, the managing director of Loch Fyne Langoustines and Loch Fyne Seafarms. McMillan, who employs 22 staff directly and a further 48 on vessels, was forced to close temporarily three weeks ago because of the pandemic.“We are waiting with bated breath,” said McMillan, who processes and exports scallops, lobsters and crabs. “If we can’t get that or we are not eligible, we’re finished.”“We are having to pay staff weekly. It’s a huge strain on the business as we haven’t any cash.”Based in Tarbert, Argyll and Bute, which has a population of 1,500, McMillan is one of the village’s largest employers.“Twenty-two jobs is a lot of families,” McMillan said.Selling direct to the public, a tactic used by some shellfish fishermen in Devon and Cornwall, is more challenging in remote communities in Scotland, he said.“Everyone is trying to sell to the general public but for us it’s very precarious. Businesses like ours depend on volume. I see people in Cornwall doing that. But when you live remotely as we do, there is just not the demand.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5251c00c2b713adbde4e29832bcdbd4dcb6707b5/0_205_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47c6ab23f2d54a0e3bf0c145ed4f98d6","title":"the bigamist ida lupino film","story":"The latest in a seres of writers highlighting underrated films available to stream sees a recommendation for Ida Lupino’s taut 1953 drama about a love triangleIda Lupino is the great director of noirs, thrillers and message pictures from the 1950s – an inspired film-maker to compare with Nicholas Ray and Robert Siodmak. She combined it with being a producer, a distributor and, most importantly of all, a star, directing herself in this fierce, extraordinarily potent drama, which candidly delivers its subject matter right up front in the title. It tells us a lot about the sexual politics of the age.Is The Bigamist really a noir? Maybe it doesn’t have the cynicism, the open sexuality or the violence to count: a love triangle of three basically decent people whose decency is never for a moment seriously impugned or undermined. The most flagrantly noir thing about The Bigamist could be the moment in the Chinese restaurant when one of the customers is briefly revealed to have a sizable scar down his face: he is glimpsed only for a moment. Yet The Bigamist is certainly about a serious criminal offence, and it is certainly about sexual infidelity – that driving force of the noir.Edmond O’Brien and Joan Fontaine play Harry and Eve, a childless married couple in their 30s, who jointly run a business selling deep freezers (a tellingly chilly unromantic commodity). Harry is out on the road a lot as a travelling salesman, spending a good deal of time in Los Angeles, where the units are manufactured and warehoused, and Eve is back at home in San Francisco handling the admin, a job she is really good at, and the couple has agreed she should abandon the traditional stay-at-home wife role for this businesslike career-woman identity, at least partly because she can’t have a baby – a symbolic coincidence.Lupino contrives a droll flashback sequence in which, with Harry narrating his tale of woe, she ends the accompanying montage on the image of a store-window mannequin, the picture of Eve’s supposed sleek emptiness. And in truth, it is not a particularly sympathetic role for Joan Fontaine, whose character seems pretty obtuse about all the festering unhappiness and dishonesty in their marriage – although there is a real sensuality in their embraces. Fontaine has a seductively intimate mannerism of allowing her gaze to dart up and down O’Brien’s face.But they have decided to apply to adopt a baby, and the state official, Mr Arnold (played by Edmund Gwenn) senses a shifty evasiveness in Harry when he tells them he will have to investigate their home life. Arnold is the nearest thing this film has to a cop, with a Columbo-like persistent politeness. And when he tracks down Harry to his “alternative” home address in Los Angeles, Harry opens the door to him with an air of infinite wretchedness and guilt, and Arnold is astonished to hear a baby crying behind him.Miserably, Harry confesses that in his loneliness, he had struck up a friendship with a woman on an LA tour bus showing the movie stars’ homes – archly, one starry home mentioned by the tour-bus driver is that of the real-life Edmund Gwenn, famous for playing Kris Kringle, the “Santa” in Miracle on 34th Street, and the movie makes it clear that he is to be no Santa for Harry.The woman is Phyllis, wonderfully played by Lupino they meet when he lights her cigarette – that time-honoured quasi-sexual moment of contact. She is low on cash and waits tables at a Chinese restaurant, but is humorous, unsentimental, utterly without self-pity, warm and yet vulnerable in a way that Eve isn’t. Their affair blossoms, and like Celia Johnson with Trevor Howard in the early stages of Brief Encounter, poor Harry tries making light of it in conversation with his spouse, jauntily declaring that he is having an adventure with her, as if trying to convince himself that there is naturally nothing in this chance meeting, adding that she is “not really beautiful, but nice – a funny little mouse”. It’s not a bad description of Lupino, but doesn’t begin to convey her allure. Actually, he’s the mouse.So things continue from there. Aghast, Arnold asks Harry the key question: “Did you think you could live this lie for a lifetime?” Weak and stricken Harry has no real answer, but the movie very plausibly shows how, step-by-step, encumbered by his own respectability and terrified of hurting the feelings of either woman, he’d got into this jam.A classic noir might show a married man falling in love with another woman and then conspiring with her to murder his wife. This is a kind of tragic or tragicomic variation on that – in some ways a more relatable one – in which the poor sap isn’t sufficiently wicked for anything of the sort, and just tries to have the best of both worlds, while sinking into a state of denial. This is the bourgeois-surrealist version of noir, the timid noir, in which the man lives in dual fantasy households, rather than carry out the act of daring involved in choosing just one. His lawyer will later point out that society would probably hypocritically wink at the idea of him taking Phyllis as his mistress, but is scandalised at him making her his second wife.The mysterious figure in all this is probably the film’s producer and screenwriter Collier Young, who was married to Joan Fontaine when the film was made, and before that was married to Ida Lupino. So he was engaging in a kind of creative or imaginative bigamy of his own both women have to be sympathetic for the drama to work, though he interestingly makes Phyllis far more attractive than Eve. (In fact, Young went on to direct Ida Lupino’s TV sitcom Mr Adams and Eve in which she starred with Howard Duff, with whom Lupino had been unfaithful – and got pregnant – while married to Young.) The Bigamist is a taut, muscular, controlled picture, and Lupino shapes all three performances with pure mastery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4afe84595b902d27f1b1074eec58e862aa6a7c/0_1626_5650_3391/master/5650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df25b3b6690cd3ae1e090149962fe2bb","title":"liam charles recipe simnel frangipane tart easter cake sweet spot","story":"The traditional Easter cake meets marzipan for a bake that’s the best of both worldsSimnel cake is an Easter classic and, in my opinion, frangipane is an always classic.

Manchester City are understood to be in talks with their squad over wage deferrals.Southampton became the first Premier League club to reach an agreement over reduced pay with their players, who came to the consensus that wage deferrals were the fairest solution after holding talks with the board about the financial disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The club said their manager, Ralph Hasenhüttl, senior coaching staff and board of directors would also defer some of their pay for the next three months.It is understood Southampton’s chief executive, Martin Semmens, played a leading role in the talks, coordinating a plan between the players and the club’s owners, the Gao family and Katharina Liebherr.The economic consequences of the suspension of English football were laid bare to the players and the agreement, believed to have the backing of the Professional Footballers’ Association, enables Southampton to commit to not furloughing staff until the end of June.It represents a significant breakthrough in the pay dispute between top-flight players and owners since the postponement of the season. Although Premier League clubs could lose £1.137bn if the season is cancelled, they have found it difficult to convince players to lower their pay.However, players are keen to contribute to society – it was announced on Wednesday that Premier League captains had launched a charitable fund, #PlayersTogether, to help people involved in tackling the pandemic – and they have also wanted clubs to make clear why wage drops are necessary.West Ham have explained their financial situation to the players, who are discussing whether to defer pay. The captain, Mark Noble, will play a big role in representing the squad.Brighton’s chief executive, Paul Barber, said the club’s financial situation had been set out to the players and he is hopeful they will assist by accepting a salary drop. “What we have said is if we can take a cut on wages to reduce the loss of matchday income, that would be a significant help to us,” he said. “If, on the other hand, at some stage in the future we recover that matchday income by playing those matches in front of a crowd, then we would simply return that money.”Barber, the manager, Graham Potter, and the technical director, Dan Ashworth, have taken pay cuts. Barber said heating and lighting had been turned off at the training ground and stadium as a cost-cutting measure.There are issues to resolve elsewhere. Bournemouth, Newcastle, Norwich and Tottenham have placed non-playing staff on furlough, and Crystal Palace are struggling to come to an agreement with their players about wage deferrals.Wolves players and coaching staff have teamed up to make a six-figure donation to the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust. The players have donated separately to #PlayersTogether. Wolves and their owner, Fosun, have already donated 6,300 pieces of protective equipment to the city’s NHS and council."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/283e74b223bf00c2b3167e4a11de7ff81687c29e/0_1345_4866_2921/master/4866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55482417c6a9bcd1006f099238b0125d","title":"sir denis follows the man who ended the ban on women playing football","story":"With the former secretary of the FA set to be inducted posthumously into the University of Nottingham’s Sport Hall of Fame we speak to his daughter about his remarkable lifeMuch has been made of the Football Association’s 50-year ban from 1921 on female players using its affiliated pitches, which scythed down the women’s game just as its growth had accelerated, with matches attracting attendances in excess of 50,000. Little, though, has been said of the eventual lifting of the ban in 1971, or of the man who authored the letter rescinding it. Now, the University of Nottingham is set to induct posthumously Sir Denis Follows – the then secretary of the FA and an alumnus – into its Sport Hall of Fame.The uncovering of the small but critical role of Follows, who died in 1983 aged 75, in the development of women’s football - which later led to him being named honorary life vice-president of the Women’s Football Association – happened by chance. Follows’s daughter, Maggie Ferris – another Nottingham alumnus – mentioned her father in a routine fundraising phone call with the university.The student that jotted down a few notes from their call took them away and soon afterwards the university and Ferris began to explore the history of a man had a firm belief in equality and a person’s right to play sport and felt the lifting of the ban was natural.“He was always campaigning about things,” explains Ferris. “That was just part of what he was. And he was quite self-effacing, he never made a big deal of any achievement. Well, he was pretty pleased about winning the World Cup,” she adds with a chuckle.Follows was FA secretary in 1966. He introduced the idea of the first mascot for a finals – World Cup Willie – and separated the tournament’s organising committee, for which his daughter worked in the holidays, from the everyday running of the FA. He also presided over the loss of the Jules Rimet trophy – when it was stolen from a stamp exhibition on 20 March – and subsequent recovery.“The Jules Rimet cup was fabulous, it was absolutely beautiful. I’ve got a photo of my mum in our back garden holding it with our dog. Anyway, he decided that the best way to get it to Mexico was in his briefcase, so he just carried his briefcase all the time. In that way he was quite practical. It worked. First it was under the bed, then in his briefcase.”When Nobby Stiles’ contact lenses went missing, it was Ferris’s sister who would go to an all-night Boots to get some more and Follows, who had connections with pilots as general secretary of the British Airline Pilots’ Association (Balpa), who would arrange for them to be flown out to Stiles.Follows’s journey either side of 1966 is equally remarkable. Born in 1908, he started in student politics, becoming chairman of the University Athletics Union, representing the body on the FA council and being given the job of unpaid FA treasurer, before becoming president of the National Union of Students.In those various posts, he travelled in the 1930s to Latvia before it was invaded by the Soviet Union and to Madrid as Spain powered toward the start of the civil war in 1936, attending student conferences. “In a lot of domestic ways he was not capable at all,” says Ferris. “He could just about do tea and toast or boil an egg but in some ways he was a real innovator. He was in his treatment of women. I found an old photograph of a 1930s committee that he was on at the university and a third of the people in the photograph are women. He had always worked with women in an equivalent role, he never expected women to be the underdogs.”Follows was partially blind in one eye and was therefore ruled out of national service during the second world war but still joined the RAF as a lecturer. Postwar that enabled him to take on the general secretary role with Balpa, which he held until 1974. Meanwhile he succeeded Sir Stanley Rous as secretary of the FA in 1962.The duel career paths gave him a unique role in the Munich air disaster in 1958. “When there was the the crash with the Busby Babes in it Dad was the general secretary of Balpa, but he was also treasurer of the FA,” explains Ferris. Follows became the union representative of the pilot, Captain James Thain, who was initially blamed for the crash, and spent more than a decade working on the extremely emotive case to clear his name. “Initially he was a scapegoat, guilty, that he had failed to clear the ice on the wings despite witnesses saying there was no ice, but Dad got him cleared in 1968,” says Ferris.It would be one of his final big acts in charge at the FA, leaving under two years later and taking up his post as chairman of the British Olympics Association in 1977. There Follows saw off intense pressure from Margaret Thatcher’s government to boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics in protest at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and defended the right of British athletes to compete at the Games.“Of course it was Seb Coe’s gold medal that year,” she adds. “And he has said himself, I believe, that if it hadn’t been for my father he probably would have never won a gold medal.” Instead, with government funding cut, Follows travelled the length and breadth of the country “trying to raise money for the Olympics, because he was just so desperate for them to be able to do what they wanted to do, without government money at all. And he did it.”His induction into the hall of fame is on hold, coronavirus pending, but Nottingham’s head of sport, Dan Tilley, is looking forward to recognising “the affinity he had for student sport, the connection to the university, the fact that he has achieved a huge amount in his career”.Tilley says: “It feels only right that we celebrate him. We push a strong equality and ersity agenda here and it’s quite nice for our women footballers to reflect on the fact that someone who came through our university was someone who lifted the ridiculous ban on women’s football that had been in place since the 1920s.“Sometimes sports administrators behind things get overlooked and actually some of the things they do are quite significant.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59cacd2c07fb4442e4a694d9bf02756158befb1a/0_0_4058_2435/master/4058.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=115a2356dcd4235b6373c4bd8e767010","title":"tanzania to ease education ban on pregnant girls but not in classrooms","story":"Official announcement greeted with cautious optimism but World Bank comes under fire over $500m education loan Tanzania has pledged to improve access to education for pregnant girls after receiving a controversial $500m (£402m) World Bank loan, but has stopped short of readmitting them to mainstream classrooms.The World Bank has been accused of undermining human rights and has faced criticism from local and international civil society groups over the Tanzania secondary education quality improvement programme loan. Campaigners say approval should not have been given without first securing a commitment from the government to reverse its discrimination towards pregnant girls and end compulsory pregnancy tests.“The government is committed to ensure that they continue with their education as prescribed in the project.”Of the 60,000 students who drop out of secondary school every year in Tanzania, 5,500 leave due to pregnancy according to World Bank data.Tanzania’s ban on pregnant schoolgirls dates back to the 60s. Amid renewed criticism, it was reaffirmed in a 2017 speech by Tanzania’s president, John Magufuli, who stated that “as long as I am president … no pregnant student will be allowed to return to school. We cannot allow this immoral behaviour to permeate our primary and secondary schools.”Human rights lawyer Judy Gitau, regional coordinator at Equality Now, welcomed Ndalichako’s declaration and said she was “cautiously optimistic” about “the first time the government of Tanzania has publicly announced in an official state document that it will include pregnant girls in secondary school education”But Elín Martinez, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the Tanzanian government’s positionremained unchanged. She referred to a recent tweet in Swahili from Tanzania’s chief government spokesperson that indicated the government has set up parallel systems for pregnant girls.“Tanzania will continue to arbitrarily deny pregnant girls the right to study in formal public primary and secondary schools – and they will only have an option of studying in a parallel system, which will now be built using the World Bank’s loan,” said Martínez, adding that the “alternative education pathways” only offer a condensed version of the curriculum, and at a cost.The World Bank has “undermined its own commitment to non-discrimination and to improving the lives of ‘marginalised groups,’” she said.Gitau condemmed the parallel system and called for the “reintegration of all pregnant girls to mainstream education”.It also stated that the government has “agreed to assess the prevalence of pregnancy testing and develop an approach to address this practice” and that the World Bank will “advocate a halt to all involuntary pregnancy testing in schools in Tanzania”.The World Bank and the Tanzanian ministry of education were unavailable for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/689dd88723bd801e8cc9aaf72efb3d7fb742637d/280_491_4558_2734/master/4558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a833b790baa5cb7a488d1603797aa0b","title":"have you and your uk neighbours become friendlier since the coronavirus lockdown","story":"We would like to hear about your neighbourly tales during the coronavirus lockdownHave you become more neighbourly?Do you have a new back (or front) garden community – all kept at a respectable social distance, of course?

Inspired by the recent social media trend, Jane, her husband Chris, their son Nick and daughter Amy – who are all in lockdown together – set themselves an Easter challenge to recreate a classic artwork using things they already had at home.To achieve the image, they took four separate shots in their back garden – changing costumes and poses between each – and then stitched the photos together digitally. “My husband kept saying: ‘We’ve got to be quick because the light keeps changing.’ He was putting us under loads of pressure. We were all wearing different bits of sheet and he was saying ‘Come on, get changed!’ and we’d say ‘Where’s my arm supposed to be? Where am I looking?’ … You’d probably only do it in a lockdown.” As people across the UK must continue to stay at home because of the coronavirus, we asked  readers how they are planning to celebrate Easter in lockdown.Dozens of churchgoers told us that they have discovered new ways to worship together, and will be tuning into online services and prayer meetings.A group called Student Cross has adapted its annual pilgrimage to the Anglican and Roman Catholic shrines in Little Walsingham, Norfolk. “We normally walk in 11 different groups, carrying a cross and stopping to share refreshment and reflections with those we meet,” says Laura Mitcham.But with the pilgrimage cancelled this year, participants can instead go online to log their steps from walking around their home or local area as part of their daily exercise, as well as taking part in daily Zoom liturgy services. “It’s not the same as the physical pilgrimage, says Mitcham, “but it’s something special that will be remembered due to its unique nature and the way the community has pulled together.”Many people across the country are baking hot cross buns and Simnel cakes, decorating houses with homemade ornaments, and organising indoor Easter egg hunts.“My daughter absolutely loves rabbits so Easter is her favourite time of year,” says Rachel Acres from Bradford-on-Avon. On Thursday, she and Bethany, seven, dug out leftover cardboard from their garage to make into giant rabbits and decorate their front garden “to wish all passers-by a happy Easter”.In Cornwall, Sarah Parmenter is staging a mini-festival for her four-year-old son who has loved doing Easter egg hunts with his cousins and friends in previous years. “The bunting will be out, magical Easter egg plants will have grown in the garden and of course the bunny will have visited – apparently he has a special sleigh which allows him to comply with social distancing requirements,” says Parmenter. “We already have an Easter tree decorated with a special sign, reminding the bunny to stop here.”For Millie Jones and her housemates, this weekend marks not only Easter but also the end of their two-week self-quarantine after one started showing symptoms. To celebrate, they’ll have “a very tame blowout” and recreate a typical Christmas day: Bucks Fizz and croissants in the morning, films and chocolate in the afternoon, then a huge roast dinner.“We want to make it as fun as possible,” says Jones. “It feels like we’re all living in the week between Christmas and New Year anyway, so we want to create a festive day, celebrating each other, in this time of lockdown.”Rik Sterken and his family had planned to spend a few nights on the Welsh coast this weekend. Instead, they’re taking a mini-camping trip into their back garden. “We reckon the tent just about fits,” says Sterken. “We’re trying to keep a sense of normality but also a sense of adventure as well.”On Friday night, Sterken, his wife and two children will eat pizzas from their home-built, wood-fired pizza oven for the first time this year, and enjoy barbecued bacon butties on Saturday morning. “The kids are really excited, although we haven’t told them yet they’ll be sleeping on camping mats,” he says.And unable to go to France on holiday, Crista Hazell and her husband Jon will be donning rabbit ears and painting on whiskers to be the Easter bunny for their older neighbours.“We know they can’t see their families so thought we’d help them find a smile on Sunday by placing a few Easter eggs (with clean hands) on doorsteps before the sun rises,” says Crista, an author and education consultant from Bristol. “It’s something a bit daft, but hopefully we can give them a little love and enjoyment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de02ae9cfafd6d35f6efbdf2fe431ee5097b7ee9/114_96_1723_1034/master/1723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=002c98f1f817c7b3e7c96417033c3931","title":"coronavirus stars bbc sports commentator andrew cotters dogs olive and mabel go viral","story":"Bereft of actual sports to preside over, Cotter turns to his two competitive petsIt is a common refrain among pet owners right now that dogs are the only ones whose lives have been improved by coronavirus. But the animals are making our isolation more enjoyable too.Exhibit A: the BBC sports commentator Andrew Cotter who, bereft of actual sports to commentate, has turned his attention to his two labradors: the older Olive and the younger Mabel.“So into the final minute and Olive in possession – but this is where Mabel is strong, chasing the game, using that intensity,” Cotter begins, deadpan and calm, with that recognisable Scottish voice heard at Wimbledon, the Commonwealth Games and the Olympics.The dogs he films are engaged in a quiet power battle over an orange rubber bone that appears to have been in contention for some time.Olive holds strong for a while but then gets cocky, loosening her grip and positioning the toy up lengthways to give it a little lick. This turns out to be the moment of her downfall. With a steady intensity of focus – “built on patience and sheer belief” – Mabel snatches it away, winning the title of “very good dog”.Shared on Thursday night, the short clip was viewed more than 3m times in less than five hours – testament perhaps to a widespread craving for joy around the world.But the contest between these “great rivals” wasn’t a one-off: it’s the second match in what we can only hope will be an ongoing series.The first game – an eating competition posted on 28 March, in which Olive (“focused, relentless, tasting absolutely nothing”) reclaimed her title against the rising star – was viewed 9m times, retweeted by Ryan Reynolds and featured on ESPN.“None of this has changed Mabel or Olive,” Cotter told the  in the wash-out from the first contest, “although a few friends have said Mabel was robbed, because I messed up getting her bowl down. There are demands for a rematch.”“It just shows how much we are all missing sport and what we term ‘normal life’,” he continued. “We absolutely take it for granted and we are at last realising that. I believe when sport returns, there will be a huge outpouring and it will not nearly be as cynical as before. Hopefully, that will be soon, as I am unemployed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ca59ba684b4a3f91dda4cd151a23d5f6864958/4_0_4052_2432/master/4052.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c0a79863cda1e7270442e0066f08e1e","title":"i started shouting at the midwives the stress of giving birth under lockdown","story":"Having a baby is always nerve-racking – and women now have unexpected worries to contend with. New mothers share their stories of ‘incredible’ midwives, and the joy and pain of giving birth during a pandemicHelen Simmons, a 28-year-old film producer from London, went into labour with her second child on the evening of 30 March – exactly a week after Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown. “It felt like a 1960s-style birth,” she jokes.She arrived at the Royal Free hospital with her husband, Charles, at 5.30am the following day. “We were hoping for the best,” Simmons says. Instead, Charles was sent home because of new visitor restrictions brought about by the outbreak, and Simmons was sent to a labour ward on her own. She was hungry – she hadn’t brought enough food with her – so Charles dropped some off and stayed with her for a few hours before being ordered to leave again.For the next 10 hours, Simmons was in labour alone and Charles was relegated to a waiting room outside, like a Mad Men-era husband. It was tough. “The hardest bit of labour isn’t the pushing,” Simmons says. “It’s the contractions. And doing that alone … you don’t realise you need your partner so much, emotionally and physically, until you can’t have that person there with you.”After a 30-hour labour, the majority of that time spent alone, their daughter, Isla, was born on 1 April at 4.40am. Charles was allowed in to watch Isla being born before being ushered out. It certainly wasn’t the birth they had hoped for or planned. Yet Simmons feels the experience meant she discovered an inner strength she hadn’t known she had. “It gave me a newfound respect for women through history,” she says.As the coronavirus pandemic continues, pregnant women across the country will be wondering how it will affect them. “It’s an anxious time for pregnant women,” says Maria Booker of the charity Birthrights. “They are concerned about whether their partner can stay with them or what the birth will be like.”At the moment, according to official guidance, no British woman should have to give birth alone. “Visiting is restricted to help stop the spread of coronavirus,” says NHS England, “but our guidance is absolutely clear that a specific exception should be made for birthing partners when a woman is in labour.” The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) guidelines state that partners may not be able to accompany women during their induction and the early stages of labour because of physical distancing guidelines. But it adds: “At the point you go into active labour, you will be moved to your own room and your birth partner will be able to join you.” Provided, of course, they are not showing any signs of illness. No visitors are allowed post-birth.But there is a degree of confusion about how the rules are being enforced by different trusts. Simmons spent most of her labour alone, but others have partners with them throughout. A business owner from London, Naomi Edmondson, 29, gave birth to a baby boy at St Mary’s hospital in Paddington on 31 March. Her husband, Ally, was allowed to stay with her throughout her planned C-section.Emily Botelho, a 30-year-old artist from Manchester, delivered a baby boy safely on 30 March. Her partner, Richard, was allowed to be by her side. But afterwards, she overheard the midwives on her hospital ward discussing the staff shortages. “There was a bit of chatter about one of the maternity wards possibly having to close, as the staff were off sick and self-isolating,” she says.Many trusts are cancelling home and water births because they require more staff. However, Booker says: “We’d ask that trusts think carefully before pulling their home birth services.” She urges them to think creatively about how to work around staff shortages some trusts are using private ambulances to serve their home birth teams, to take the pressure off NHS ambulance crews.Martha San, a 30-year-old personal assistant from London, found out through Facebook that her planned home birth had been cancelled because of a shortage of ambulances. Her midwife had planned to call her, but the news broke online first. San had postnatal depression after her first pregnancy, and had planned a home birth to minimise the chances of her mental health deteriorating. “The idea was to have the baby in an environment I felt comfortable in,” she says.When it came to it, “the birth was great”, says San. Her husband, Jamie, was by her side and baby River arrived safely on 29 March at Lewisham hospital in south London. “The fact I was not at home didn’t matter.” But doctors wanted to keep River in for tests and so San had to spend two nights in hospital alone because Jamie had been sent home. Her ward was noisy, and she couldn’t sleep. At 2am on the second night, San broke down. “I started shouting at the midwives and crying,” San says. “I said that I wasn’t meant to be there, this hadn’t been the plan, I shouldn’t be left alone with the baby and I wasn’t coping.”A midwife moved San to an empty ward so she could get some sleep, and looked after River for a few hours. They were discharged the next morning. But having to spend two nights in hospital alone with a newborn baby was distressing. “It just felt really wrong,” San says. “After the birth, I needed someone there and I didn’t have anyone.”Coronavirus also threw Rachael Collier-Thomas’s birth plans out of the window. The 38-year-old mother from Hertfordshire had planned to have a water birth, but it was cancelled. “When they told me I couldn’t have my water birth, I joked that I’d rather give birth to the baby at home than in a labour ward,” Collier-Thomas says. “But I didn’t actually expect that to happen.”When her waters broke on 24 March, the contractions were so mild that she carried on pottering at home. “I thought I could be like that for days.” A few hours later, Collier-Thomas felt an urge to push. “I thought: it can’t be the baby – it’s too early,” she says. “I haven’t even called the hospital.”Collier-Thomas delivered her daughter, Lottie, on her (formerly) white sofa, with the help of a local doula who had raced around. She is adamant that she didn’t seriously plan to have her daughter at home. “I know that home births can be dangerous,” Collier-Thomas says. “But maybe, subconsciously, I thought: ‘I really don’t want to have my baby on the labour ward.’” Collier-Thomas is not alone: as a result of the coronavirus lockdown, other British women are turning to freebirthing, giving birth without any medical support. Some are concerned about the risk of contracting coronavirus in hospital others have had their planned home births cancelled, and prefer to go it alone, without even midwives on hand. But having your baby at home, without medical supervision, can lead to a greater risk of complications.All the women I spoke to understand the pressures the NHS is under – and are not bitter that their births didn’t go as planned. “It’s hard to be upset,” says Simmons, when your own birth does not go to plan “because there’s so much going on. I totally get it.” Even though San’s hospital stay was upsetting, she has nothing but praise for the midwives doing their best under such difficult circumstances. “They were doing an incredible job,” she says. “But they can’t play the role of midwife and birth partner to every woman on the ward.”The strangeness of giving birth during a pandemic doesn’t end when you get home, though. Given the lockdown, many families won’t meet newborn arrivals for weeks, if not months. Helena (not her real name), a 25-year-old teacher from Edinburgh, gave birth to her first child at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 24 March. “The staff were brilliant,” she says. “Calm and supportive.” But not being able to rely on family or friends for childcare is tough. “We’re first-time parents trying to figure it out, without family for support,” she adds. “It’s stressful and overwhelming.”For some, coronavirus has cast a shadow over a joyful time. “It’s really tainted everything,” says Chloe Goodman, 38, a solicitor from Macclesfield. She gave birth to her daughter, Clara, on 20 March. Goodman describes the care she received at Macclesfield district general hospital as “brilliant”. But she feels upset Clara won’t meet her grandparents for months. “They’re only tiny for such a short period of time,” Goodman says. “They change so quickly.” Helena is also finding things strange. “I should be showing my baby off and going out and seeing people. But, instead, I’m sitting at home, feeling scared.”Many expectant mothers may be contemplating their births with trepidation. And the whisper networks of expecting-mum WhatsApp and Facebook groups can be frightening. “I’d been freaking out before the birth and imagining the worst,” says Edmondson. “But actually being in the hospital was the least worrying part of it all.”Edmondson urges women to ignore the rumour mill, and trust the NHS. “In the hospital, it’s not as bad as everyone says,” she adds. “For me, it was calm, and when you have your baby you’re in this lovely bubble. You’re not paying attention to all the scary stuff people are posting on social media.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c92fe2672ec8691100da3694352941badbd1e32d/0_380_5152_3091/master/5152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5d6e02d65a92e69b8cbff527311fd94","title":"the cheapest greenest holiday ever the weird joy of garden camping with the kids","story":"In a bid to break the monotony of lockdown life, my boys and I spent the night in a tent in our garden. We toasted marshmallows and played cards – and they loved itShhh! That’s not just the wind – there’s definitely something out there, moving around outside the tent. A lion, perhaps do they hunt at night? Or a polar bear? I believe they often rip tents apart in order to devour the human occupants. Perhaps it is someone – a human, a murderer almost certainly. Unless of course it’s just Gatsby, next door’s cat, out on the scrounge again or pooing in our flower bed. Whatever, we’re way too scared to unzip and have a look.We – my family – are camping in the garden. I say my family, but it’s just me and the boys, eight and six. Their mum started off with us, but she disappeared after bedtime stories. Her words on leaving the tent? “I’m just going inside I may be some time.” I think she had planned it.To be honest, it’s a good thing she left. Our four-person tent didn’t fit in our tiny garden. So we put up my old festival tent, cosy for three even that only just went in. I know, we’re lucky – especially now – to have any garden. But I think you could do a version of this even without one. Put a tent up inside. If you haven’t got a tent, make one out of sheets and the sofa cushions, maybe. Use your imagination – and then again to decide where you are. Alexa, play jungle noises.Why is home-holidaying such a great idea? It’s cheap – really cheap almost certainly the cheapest holiday you’ll ever take. No fares, no accommodation, no campsite fees, just what you would have been consuming anyway, plus one bag of marshmallows. You can turn the heating off, too, and anyone still inside can put on an extra layer.There’s no added eco-guilt – this is almost certainly the greenest holiday you’ll ever take, too. No flying, no driving, no emissions at all, apart from the ones that children produce anyway – especially in small tents, it seems. There may be a fire – but ours was just two bits of wood. Sorry, I suppose it wasn’t entirely necessary, but I think we’ve got some credit in that department.It’s something to do, and something different to do. That has been one of the big problems during lockdown – the sameness of every day, of the weekdays merging into weekends, of not being able to get out, the lack of any kind of excitement or adventure that doesn’t come via a screen. Garden camping offers proper terror, without putting anyone in danger, although I guess that depends on where you live.It is actually – amazingly and in spite of everything – quite fun. Not just doing stuff you do on holiday, and being a bit scared, but simply sleeping in a big pile together. That’s why I think it’s transferable inside. Obviously, there’s an upper age limit if ours were much older, it would almost certainly be the lamest, most ridiculous idea ever. But this time they enjoyed it, the big-pileness of it, being close as a family, talking, having a laugh. Fighting, too, of course, but fighting somewhere new. They want there to be a next time.We were supposed to be going to Wales for a week, in the Easter holidays. Then we weren’t going to Wales, or anywhere, obviously. No one even knows when the weekends are, let alone remembers when the Easter holidays were meant to be. The normal punctuation of life has gone. But why let this thing spoil everything? We’ve had a bash at home-schooling (although we would definitely go straight into special measures if Ofsted visited) why shouldn’t we home-holiday, too?There was some cheating. We cooked our pasta inside, but brought it out to eat. We made a fire in the barbecue to burn marshmallows on afterwards. Different people do different things on holiday we burn marshmallows. Do what you do on holiday, to make it feel (a bit) like one.We also play cards on holiday, so after brushing teeth at the outside tap, that’s what we did: old maid and whist. Followed by books. No, we cannot Zoom Mummy – she’s only been gone five minutes. God, is it really only 8.25pm?It was quite a long night. And a cold one. (The boys were all right – they shared the air mattress – but I was on the ground.) And a noisy one. Camping in north-west London, you hear things you might not normally associate with camping, or hear in Wales, say. Not just the prowling murderercat, but the Jubilee line, bringing key-worker heroes home. A domestic disagreement (it’s a good way of getting to know the neighbours better). An electric guitar from up the road (“OI, PIPE DOWN, JIMI HENDRIX!”) Also sirens – lots of sirens – a sobering reminder of what this is all really about. While we’re playing Scott of the Antarctic, people nearby are dying.At last, is that the first 226 bus of the day, early-shift heroes off to work? That means it’s just before five, and not too much longer of this to go. There’s even a dawn chorus of sorts – the cooing of a London pigeon and something shrill and persistent, an avian alarm call, perhaps. Watch out – Gatsby’s about. By the time we unzip and emerge, blinking and shivering, the local goldfinch posse is burbling busily at the bird feeder. See, we’re reconnecting with nature, too.And our house! In a whole new light, bricks and mortar, heating, beds, porridge. What just yesterday was beginning to feel a little like a prison now looks like the greatest thing in the world, as One Ton Depot might have looked to Scott, Captain Oates and companions, had they made it. There’s nothing like taking something away to make you really appreciate it. Learn to love home again – or appreciate it, at least.No, we’re not doing it tonight, too – that was a short holiday, like a little early-season minibreak. They – I – need a good night’s sleep in a warm bed. We will go again, though, soon. Next Tuesday? Oh, apparently, it’s already in the diary. But now there’s tidying up to do – damp stuff to come in, mattress to be deflated, tent to be unpitched and wrestled into the bag … the boring stuff, normally, but less so now – just stuff to do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a5ad092e828254d528e8d87f85d912f465ee76b/0_48_1392_836/master/1392.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddbf04e68cca99cb60df01ed7516b768","title":"the hotrats track of week","story":"This week we’ve got a chewy take on a Kelis classic, a husky slow jam and a beguiling piece of art-popIn lockdown, where Pringles dipped in peanut butter is an acceptable breakfast, it’s hard to know what we actually need.

By  Stephen BuranyiIf, like me, you have been confined to your home, glued to the news and nursing ever greater anxiety about the state of the world, you have probably become familiar with the sight of the World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and his daily press briefings. Tedros, as he is known, is a calming presence in the midst of the crisis. Flanked by an international cast of scientists, he always seems confident that if we have hope, listen to the experts and pull together, we will get through this.Watching this reassuring spectacle, it is possible to imagine a world in which every nation respects the WHO’s authority, follows its advice and lets it coordinate the flow of information, resources and medical equipment across national boundaries to areas of greatest need.That is not the world we live in. “The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric,” tweeted Donald Trump on 7 April, summing up just one of the many lines of criticism the WHO is currently facing. It is not just Trump – even some of the WHO’s supporters in government, academia and NGOs argue that since the start of the coronavirus crisis, it has caved in to nationalist bullies, praised draconian quarantine measures and failed to protect the liberal international order of which it is a linchpin. “You’ve got a situation where it looks like WHO doesn’t want to exercise its authority,” said David Fidler, a fellow in global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a regular consultant to the WHO.Meanwhile, the WHO is desperately struggling to get its 194 member states to actually follow its guidance. The WHO’s leaders are “very frustrated,” said John MacKenzie, a virologist and adviser on the WHO’s emergency committee. “The messages come out loud and clear, and some disregard the warnings. The US largely did, the UK largely did.”On 11 March, the day Tedros declared the coronavirus a pandemic, he spoke darkly of “alarming levels of inaction” from many countries. Pressed by journalists to name them, Mike Ryan, the usually no-nonsense Irish trauma doctor who heads the WHO’s Covid-19 response, demurred. “You know who you are,” he said, adding that “we don’t criticise our member states in public”.There is a simple reason for this. For all the responsibility vested in the WHO, it has little power. Unlike international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the WHO, which is a specialised body of the UN, has no ability to bind or sanction its members. Its annual operating budget, about $2bn in 2019, is smaller than that of many university hospitals, and split among a dizzying array of public health and research projects. The WHO is less like a military general or elected leader with a strong mandate, and more like an underpaid sports coach wary of “losing the dressing room”, who can only get their way by charming, grovelling, cajoling and occasionally pleading with the players to do as they say.The WHO “has been drained of power and resources”, said Richard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet. “Its coordinating authority and capacity are weak. Its ability to direct an international response to a life-threatening epidemic is non-existent.”At the same time, the international order on which the WHO relies is fraying, as aggressive nationalism becomes normalised around the world. “All the previous rules about global norms, public health and understanding of what’s expected in terms of an outbreak has crumbled,” said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. “None of us know where this is leading.”The WHO was born during the moment of hopeful internationalism that followed the chaos of the second world war. The idea of global collaboration in fighting disease was not new – in the 19th century, at periodic International Sanitary Conferences, countries had standardised quarantine procedures for cholera and yellow fever – but the WHO constitution, adopted in 1948, envisioned a far grander global mission, nothing less than “the attainment by all people of the highest possible levels of health”.One of the WHO’s favourite success stories is the role it played in eliminating smallpox, a disease that was still killing millions each year in the 50s, despite the existence of a vaccine. Although the WHO worked on immunisation research, its most vital role was organisational and diplomatic. In 1959, it convinced the Soviet Union to manufacture 25 million vaccine doses, which the WHO would distribute. Not to be left behind, the US donated millions of dollars to vaccination programmes, both directly and through the WHO. By the late 60s, every nation in the UN was sending a detailed weekly report to WHO headquarters on their number of smallpox cases and recent progress. And in 1979, WHO declared smallpox eradicated, a first in world history. The WHO didn’t provide the most money, immunise the most people, or invent key technologies such as the bifurcated needle, but it is hard to imagine smallpox having been defeated without it.If the story of smallpox eradication shows the WHO acting as something like an international ministry of public health, it doesn’t explain its current position as an emergency service, surveying the world for disease outbreaks and springing into action to contain them. That is a more recent addition to its portfolio, which came after a period, in the 80s and 90s, when the WHO seemed to be losing its earlier dynamism. The diseases it was partly created to address – smallpox, yellow fever and the plague – had either been eradicated or were in decline, and it was slow to identify new threats such as HIVAids. Under the leadership of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, from 1988 to 1998, the organisation stagnated, and some member states complained about poor management and alleged petty corruption.Two things happened at the turn of the century that would shape the WHO we now see tackling the Covid-19 crisis. In 1998, the fiery former prime minister of Norway, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, was elected director general. And in 2002, a farmer in China’s Guangdong province became sick with a deadly, never-before-seen respiratory disease that quickly spread among the hospital staff who had treated him, and went on to become the first pandemic of the newly globalised 21st century: one that arose suddenly, had no treatment or cure, and spread with the speed and reach of international business.Given the WHO’s sprawling structure, vague mandate and reliance on diplomacy, its director general holds immense power to shape it. Even before she took on the role, Brundtland was comfortable on the world stage. “I was already a political leader, and I was used to this kind of authority,” she told me. Like her friend Kofi Annan, the charismatic UN leader, Brundtland believed that international bodies should be prepared to lead when necessary, rather than being bossed around by powerful nations. “If the job is to direct and coordinate global health, it’s not a question of what one or several governments ask you to do,” she said. “We are working for humanity.”Brundtland pushed the WHO to use its local contacts, diplomatic channels and the emerging internet to locate potential outbreaks, all of which made the organisation less reliant on national governments for information. Within just a few years, this strategy proved its worth. In November 2002, when the Chinese government became aware of the first cases of a novel respiratory disease, later named Sars, it failed to alert the WHO. But, as part of Brundtland’s new approach, WHO staff were monitoring Chinese medical message boards and news media anyway, and were aware of what was then thought to be an atypical pneumonia outbreak. Adding to their suspicions, on 10 February 2003, David Heymann, who was then executive director of the WHO’s communicable diseases cluster, received an email from the son of a former WHO staff member in China warning of a “strange contagious disease” that had already killed 100 people, but which was “not allowed to be made known to the public”. The WHO took the information it had to China, which made its first official report to the WHO the next day.Although the WHO had no formal powers to monitor and censure its members, Brundtland wasn’t shy about doing so anyway. In the ensuing months she would accuse China of withholding information, claiming that the outbreak might have been contained “if the WHO had been able to help at an earlier stage” and exhorting the Chinese to “let us come in as quickly as possible!” With remarkable speed, China fell in line and shared its data with the WHO. “After her statements to China, no other countries hesitated,” said Heymann.In March 2003, as the disease spread – reaching Hong Kong, Vietnam and then Canada – for the first time in its history, the WHO issued advice against travelling to affected areas. (Before then, the decision to advise on travel had always been left up to member states.) Despite having no formal powers to ground planes, the measures worked. “Passengers and flights dropped dramatically as soon as we issued the recommendations,” said Heymann.The WHO’s response to Sars was considered a huge success. Fewer than 1,000 people worldwide died of the disease, despite it reaching a total of 26 countries. The pandemic was defeated not with vaccines or medicines, but with NPIs, or “non-pharmaceutical interventions” in WHO parlance: travel warnings, tracking, testing and isolating cases, and a huge information-gathering operation across multiple countries, all made possible by the WHO’s willingness to wield authority that it had, in a sense, created simply by speaking it into existence. “Brundtland did things the WHO had no authority doing. She just did them,” said Fidler. “She sort of used Sars as a way to test drive some very radical changes.”“After Sars, the WHO’s position was essentially: that was great, let’s formalise it,” said Clare Wenham, a professor of global health policy at LSE. In 2005, the WHO drew up a new version of the International Health Regulations (IHR), the central legal document that all member states are bound by. According to Fidler, the updated IHR, which is in force to this day, is a radical document. It asks its members to prepare for public health threats according to standards set by the WHO, and to report any outbreaks and all subsequent developments. It also allows the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (or PHEIC, pronounced, incredibly, “fake”), using its own information, over the objection of any single country. During an emergency, countries are expected to take the lead from the WHO’s guidelines and report any deviations to the organisation. All of these requirements, bar the reporting of outbreaks, were new.But the document stopped short of giving the WHO real power if states refuse to comply. “The WHO isn’t Nato, it’s not the security council,” said Gian Luca Burci, who was the WHO’s legal counsel until 2018. The US, fixated on bioterrorism after 911, supported giving the organisation some extended powers, but was opposed by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which were wary of US influence. There was a general reluctance to hand an international organisation any more power. “WHO members were happy with the actions that were taken during Sars, but there was definitely a sense afterward of ‘What if that was us in China’s spot?’,” explained Catherine Worsnop, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. In short: thanks for stopping the pandemic, but we don’t want to be told what to do.If the WHO has seemed at times weak or tentative – very un-Brundtland-like – in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, it is partly because of its bruising experiences during the past decade. From 2009 onwards, the WHO faced condemnation from the press and the international community for its handling of successive crises, all during a decade when the financial and diplomatic order that sustained it began to break down.First, there was the outbreak of H1N1, or “swine flu”. The novel influenza virus was discovered in Mexico in March 2009, and by June, when the WHO declared a pandemic, there were more than 28,000 cases in 74 countries. Over the next year, the WHO coordinated the global response – less aggressively than during Sars – and on 10 August 2010, it declared the pandemic over. Almost immediately, the WHO’s approach came under scrutiny. The death toll – 18,500 confirmed deaths worldwide – was far lower than initially expected, particularly given the disease reached more than 200 countries. “Suddenly you have people saying: ‘Wait a minute, you really cried wolf on this,’” says Wenham. The media and several prominent European politicians demanded inquiries as to whether the WHO had mistakenly rung the alarm, and “cost huge amounts of money and frightened people unnecessarily”, as Paul Flynn, the former Labour MP who chaired one of the inquiries, told the Times in 2010.To this day, opinions are split as to whether H1N1 was a crisis headed off, or a false alarm. “The WHO is always at risk of being criticised as doing too much or too little,” said Keiji Fukuda, the former WHO assistant director general who led the H1N1 response. Most of the former WHO staff and academics I spoke with agreed, proposing some version of the following as an iron law of public health: act slowly and you will be criticised for failing to stop preventable deaths act aggressively and stop an outbreak before it becomes serious, and you will be accused of having overreacted. (After all, in the latter case, nothing too bad happened, so what was the big deal in the first place?)Fidler, who largely approves of WHO’s quick action during H1N1, believes that the backlash led the WHO, which was then under the command of director general Margaret Chan, to become too tentative about calling for action in the future. This was a period when the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis was also starting to take its toll on its budget. “There was a big funding shortfall,” said Andrew Cassels, director of strategy at the WHO between 2008 and 2013. “Cuts made to the emergency response programmes, personnel cuts.” The funding gap stood at nearly $300m in 2012. Entire offices were shut, including a team of social scientists working on pandemic response.When the Ebola outbreak struck west Africa in 2014, the combination of the WHO’s greater caution and reduced budget resulted in disaster. In contrast to the previous pandemic, this time the WHO was slow to act, and was widely perceived to have lost control of the situation. In the end, the US and several other nations deployed more than 5,000 military personnel at the request of the affected countries, and an ad-hoc UN committee was created to take over responsibilities from the WHO. The outbreak eventually killed 11,310 people, the vast majority in just three countries – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – paralysing their health systems for months, and causing panic across the world. Prominent scientists judged the WHO’s response an “egregious failure”.Much of the blame fell on Chan herself. She appeared shell-shocked, stressing to the press that the WHO was a technical advisory body, and that it was national governments that had ultimate responsibility for their citizens’ health. “She wanted the WHO to be an apolitical agency – more like technical support. There was a hesitancy there to push the full powers of the WHO,” said Sara Davies, a professor of global health at Griffith University in Australia.The bold, proactive culture established after Sars had seemingly faded. Fidler believes that by delaying calling Ebola an emergency, and thus failing to organise an international response at a crucial moment, the WHO’s leadership had shown they “no longer had any faith in their authority”.Today, under Tedros, the WHO finds itself in uncharted territory. Not only is it facing by far the biggest pandemic in its history, it is also having to defend itself from the nations on which it most depends. “In my 25-plus years of working on global health issues, I cannot recall the leader of a prominent developed country threatening to punish WHO in the manner President Trump did,” said Fidler, referring to the recent press conference in which Trump suggested putting “a very powerful hold” on US contributions to the WHO. In the same press conference, Trump accused the WHO of concealing information, being too slow to react to the virus, and, above all, showing favouritism towards China.Since the crisis began, Tedros has been repeatedly accused of being soft on China. Senator Marco Rubio recently told Fox News that the Chinese government had “used the WHO to mislead the world”, and claimed that the WHO “is either complicit or dangerously incompetent”. The US senator Rick Scott put it more bluntly, accusing the WHO of “helping Communist China cover up a global pandemic”. (Tedros, meanwhile, has warned of the dangers of politicising the virus.)Until very recently, the WHO was seen as a relatively neutral arena for China to extend its power. “China likes to find ways within the global system to give it a leading and benevolent image. The WHO was an uncontroversial place to do it,” said Rana Mitter, the director of the University of Oxford China Centre. No longer. The extent of the initial coverup is still unclear, but there is no question that at least at the local level, Chinese officials knew about the outbreak of a novel disease for weeks before it was reported to the WHO. During that time, Chinese doctors were prevented from speaking out.John MacKenzie, the WHO’s emergency committee adviser, told me that the organisation was “a little misled” about the Wuhan outbreak. He says that by the time the government alerted the WHO on 31 December, scientists in China had already determined via genome sequencing that the outbreak was caused by coronavirus. Yet the government didn’t confirm that until 7 January and the full genome sequence was not officially shared until 12 January. “That’s very slow,” MacKenzie told me. “For at least two weeks, we could have been making far more kits and so on for testing.” MacKenzie added that the number of cases officially declared by the Chinese in the first week – 59 in the week ending 5 January – was “nowhere near as many cases as you’d expect”. (The statistics released by the Chinese government continue to be questioned, with some reports suggesting they may have seriously understated the number of coronavirus deaths.)Despite mounting frustrations – in mid-January, China also refused the WHO’s request to send a team of scientific observers to Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak – Tedros has never come close to doing what Brundtland did and calling China out. Instead, on 28 January, he had a closed-door meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing, and two days later, he praised Chinese efforts to contain the disease, declaring that China is “setting a new standard for outbreak control”. That same day, 30 January, the WHO declared a Pheic, and began issuing prescriptions to countries around the world. On 8 February, China finally allowed WHO observers into the country. For Tedros’s supporters, this was vindication of his strategy of keeping China onside. For his critics, it was too little, too late.Elected as WHO director general in July 2017, Tedros was supported by a bloc of African and Asian countries, including China, which has considerable influence with those members. (Tedros is himself from Ethiopia, where he served as health minister and then foreign minister between 2005 and 2016.) It was a “really nasty” election, said Davies, in which the powers that have traditionally shaped the WHO, such as the US, UK and Canada, lent their support to one of Tedros’s rivals, the British doctor David Nabarro. During the campaign, Tedros was criticised for having served in a repressive government with a poor human rights record, and one of Nabarro’s backers even accused Tedros of covering up a cholera epidemic during his time as health minister. (Tedros denied the claim, describing it as a “last-minute smear campaign”, while Nabarro told the New York Times that he had never authorised his team to make this accusation against Tedros.) In response, Tedros’s supporters mounted “a collective pushback”, said Davies, against the UK and its allies, eventually winning out. Tedros became the first director general from a so-called developing country since the Brazilian Dr Marcolino Gomes Candau in 1953.While his background is in politics, Tedros is not forthright or confrontational like Brundtland. In Ethiopia, his political party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) was mostly comprised of ex-revolutionaries, men that “seemed carved out of a rock”, said Fantu Cheru, a professor at American University and former advisor to the Ethiopian government. Tedros was different – jovial and accessible, said Cheru, and able to make personal connections easily. “He is not very ideological, he believes he can work with anyone,” said Mehari Taddele Maru, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Cheru also sees Tedros as a pragmatist. “He’s not in the Chinese pocket. The Americans in particular wanted to destroy his image. Tedros knows how this game works. You need to have more allies than enemies, and those allies may not have a good track record.”“I don’t think Tedros did anything previous director generals would not have done,” said Anthony Costello, the director of the UCL Institute for Global Health. “He needed a good relationship with China in order to get in.” Even Lawrence Gostin, who has been a prominent critic of Tedros in the past, told me that “his high praise for China is understandable. He is seeking to coax China into cooperation.” He went on to note, though, that this strategy “does risk the credibility of WHO as an objective agency.”If the WHO thought it could sacrifice a bit of its credibility – overlooking China’s obvious blunders in December and January in exchange for its compliance in February – and move on, it was mistaken. The argument over China’s influence has been raging for weeks, not least since the government of Taiwan claimed that the WHO had ignored its own early reports of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus as part of a larger history of appeasing China – which has blocked Taiwan from joining the WHO (and the UN) for decades.Now that Trump, scrambling for an answer to explain why the US now has more cases of coronavirus than any other nation, has alighted upon the WHO and China as his preferred scapegoats, these questions will not go away. “I don’t think we will see the US government cut off funding,” said Fidler. “But what’s happened with this pandemic – with the WHO caught between the USChina rivalry – is not a good omen for the WHO going forward.”While the focus has been on what happened between China and the WHO in January, in epidemiological terms the crisis has moved on. Covid-19 has spread fastest and furthest in the US and Europe, through the very rich nations that largely fund and staff the WHO. Before the outbreak, the WHO struggled to get these same nations to prepare for future pandemics. Now the pandemic is here, and they are at the centre of the crisis, the WHO has been unable to keep them following its advice.Richard Horton of the Lancet said that after the WHO declared a public health emergency, “countries, especially western countries, didn’t listen. Or didn’t seek to understand what was actually taking place in China.” On 5 February, the WHO asked for $675m to fund its Coronavirus response through to April. Anthony Costello of UCL said that when he met with Tedros on 4 March, the WHO had received only $1.2m. (Tedros announced last week that the funding goal had finally been reached, around the time the number of worldwide cases passed 1 million.)Even the decision to declare a pandemic on 13 March – a largely rhetorical distinction, since calling a Pheic already requires WHO members to respond – was calculated to wake its member states up. In the UK the Premier League was still playing games, and the previous week the US had held primary election contests. “They declared a pandemic because countries weren’t taking the advice,” said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a professor of global health at the University of Sydney.The WHO stresses that the ideal response to the crisis is relatively simple. Inidual states should limit public exposure, especially by tracking and tracing all known cases – a strategy that worked in South Korea and appears to be working in Germany. On an international level, states should share scientific information and resources. These are the mantras Tedros goes back to in his briefings: “Test test test” and “solidarity solidarity solidarity”.But countries have repeatedly ignored WHO advice. In the UK, the response has been erratic, lurching between the WHO’s norms and its own strategies, such as the now-discredited pursuit of “herd immunity”. The US didn’t recommend school closures or avoiding travel until 16 March. In Sweden, restaurants are still open.Many wealthy nations have not only pursued their own national strategies for public health, but have also withdrawn from the globalised world of diplomacy and trade that they themselves set up. Earlier this year, for instance, the NHS ordered millions of masks from a French company named Valmy SAS. But in early March, the French government requisitioned all masks produced within the country, so the masks never reached Britain. This week, Germany accused the US of seizing a shipment of masks bound for Berlin from a port in Thailand while Germany previously sent inspectors to the factory of an American company in Jüchen to ensure their medical masks weren’t being exported against government orders.The WHO is battling against a breakdown in international cooperation that is far beyond its capacity to control. “Governments have retreated to national policies, and this problem predates this crisis,” said Clare Wenham, the health scholar. States have been turning away from international institutions for a long time. The WHO hasn’t driven globalisation in the same way as the WTO or IMF, but in a way it has administered it – quietly promising to take on the outbreaks that arise in an industrialised and interconnected world, and relying on the often unspoken norms of international collaboration that underlie it.Ironically, it is most needed now, at a time when faith in the other administrators and overseers of the global order are in decline – a trend that Covid-19 only seems to be accelerating. “As it’s gone on, you see the WHO becoming less important,” said Wenham. “No one is thinking about reducing the global numbers, only their own. The WHO is a global force, but people aren’t thinking globally.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1889409be27587925e5b56277be60076f6bd37b/0_175_3431_2059/master/3431.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa3d97361a1f139927e95d2c3e112b8a","title":"angela rayner to face dominic raab at pmqs","story":"Decision that deputy leader will stand in at PMQs suggests she will have prominent public roleLabour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, will stand in for Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons opposite Dominic Raab, the party announced on Thursday, as the new leader completed his reshuffle.Starmer announced his shadow cabinet earlier this week. With junior roles now also filled, he has brought more than a dozen Labour MPs who sat out the Jeremy Corbyn era or resigned in 2016 back onto the party’s frontbench.They include the former leadership candidate Jess Phillips, who will be a shadow home office minister covering domestic violence and safeguarding.Liz Kendall, who made a centrist pitch for the leadership in 2015 but lost out to Corbyn, will be shadow social care minister, and Alison McGovern, the chair of the Labour campaign group Progress and a keen footballer, will be shadow sports minister.There are also jobs for many young Labour leftwingers, including Alex Sobel and Lloyd Russell-Moyle, who will cover tourism and the natural environment respectively.Starmer’s campaign chief, Jenny Chapman, a former MP who lost her Darlington seat in December, tweeted: “This is what unity looks like.”The shadow Treasury team in particular appears to  the breadth of the party. The Liverpool Walton MP, Dan Carden, a former aide to Len McCluskey who was Corbyn’s shadow development secretary, is shadow financial secretary.He will serve alongside Wes Streeting, the Ilford North MP who was a vociferous critic of Corbyn’s leadership, and Pat McFadden, whom Corbyn sacked as Europe minister in 2016.Some of the most vociferous champions of a second Brexit referendum, including the Cardiff South MP, Stephen Doughty, have also been given frontbench roles. Doughty, who previously worked for Oxfam, will be shadow Africa minister.Rayner had already been named as Labour chair, but Starmer’s announcement that she would deputise for him at PMQs and in other key functions will ensure she has a prominent public role.Rayner had been widely seen as a potential leadership candidate after Corbyn promised to step down following the party’s general election defeat, but she stepped aside in favour of her close friend Rebecca Long-Bailey.She is a robust parliamentary performer. She was also more blunt in criticising Boris Johnson during the general election campaign than Corbyn, who stuck to his mantra of “they go low, we go high”.Rayner, who was a single mother at the age of 16, called scathing remarks by Johnson about the children of single mothers, which were unearthed during the campaign, disgusting.Starmer has signalled his willingness to take a constructive approach to working with the government to tackle the coronavirus crisis, but allies insist it is a fantasy that Labour could join a government of national unity as some Conservative backbenchers have suggested.Shadow cabinet members have been asked to make contact with their opposite numbers in government, and several have done so by raising issues of concern in the way the crisis is being dealt with.The new shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has already peppered Rishi Sunak with questions about the Treasury’s economic rescue package.It is unclear in what form parliament will return after the Easter recess.

It means, among other things, that members of the House will be able to use video conferencing to dial in remotely to parliamentary proceedings.The Lords authorities also plan to re-examine how much members receive in allowances given that they will not be expected to travel to attend the Palace of Westminster.Signed by Lord Speaker Fowler as well as the upper chamber’s political leaders, the letter said they had agreed that oral statements and oral questions should be conducted online from 21 April. They said they plan to ensure that general debates and certain stages of legislation will also be held virtually at some point in the future.The letter, signed by Fowler, Labour’s leader of the opposition Baroness Smith, the leader of the Liberal Democrats’ in the Lords Lord Newby and the Conservatives’ leader of the house Baroness Evans, said that initially, participation in virtual proceeds would be limited, with a view to expansion in the future.“The leaders, convenor and Lord Speaker have agreed that as a priority oral questions and oral statements should be, as much as possible, held virtually. A number of committees have been doing some of their work remotely over this period and that will continue once the house returns.“For fully virtual sessions, there may need to be a limit on the number being held each day to ensure Parliamentary Digital Service (PDS) resources are available, but work on this continues.“We are also working towards a position in which other types of business – general debates, certain stages of legislation – can be undertaken virtually, but we are going to have to make progress on a step-by-step basis,” the letter said.Mindful that some of the chamber’s older members may struggle with technology – their average age is 70, according to data from 2019 - the letter urges peers to acquaint themselves with Microsoft Teams so that they can participate.“We would strongly encourage all members to use the period before the house meets to familiarise themselves with the platform as this will be the means by which members can participate in any virtual proceedings,” it said.The body overseeing the House of Lords will also re-examine how much peers receive in allowances under the new system, according to the letter. At present, they can opt to receive an allowance of £313 per day, plus travel expenses and subsidised restaurant facilities.“In view of the fact we intend a significant amount of business to be able to take place virtually, after Easter the House of Lords commission will look at how the allowances system can be adapted to reflect this new, temporary way of working,” it said.One option could be for peers to be allowed to claim a half-rate, which is currently allowed for work away from Westminster.Parliament closed early for Easter as members in the Palace of Westminster sought to abide by social distancing measures to slow the spread of Covid-19.Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the House of Commons, announced last week that the government and parliament hoped that appropriate technology would be in place by 21 April, when MPs also return. It followed demands for a virtual lower chamber from the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, and opposition parties."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/827878f5af63756304642a4f33369f4b33f1ae99/0_447_2333_1400/master/2333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d0e64a0765da07cc4d52af362ce3ded","title":"raab patel downing street press briefing women","story":"Asked to rise to the occasion for the third time in a week, Random Raab almost produced some coherent sentencesCoronavirus is man’s work. At least, that appears to be the government’s assessment of it, for in the three weeks of daily Downing Street press briefings, not once has a woman minister been allowed out to be front-of-house compere. Priti Patel, Liz Truss and Thérèse Coffey have become all but invisible. Missing in action. They might as well not exist.For the third time this week it was Dominic Raab – the de facto prime minister while Boris Johnson is in intensive care – who did the business for the government. And, to be fair, he’s getting visibly better at it. He looks less unstable and more the man who can easily see out 24 hours of close police interrogation over unsolved missing persons cases. Though he might have struggled if anyone had questioned him about the disappearance of the home secretary.It also helped that the foreign secretary didn’t have any news, other than the grim daily death statistics, to impart. So he could stick to doing what he knows best, which is spilling out a random series of words, only some of which amount to fully coherent sentences. At some point in his career, the black-belt martial arts specialist is going to have to realise that the brain is also a muscle. Coming up with lines like “We are focusing on the things we need to focus on” may sound impressive at cabinet meetings, but doesn’t translate well to those of us who speak human.Still, after Raab had spent the best part of five minutes telling everyone to stay at home for Easter – the No 10 lectern had been helpfully updated with this new logo – it did become clear why Patel might have dodged a bullet by being excluded from this briefing. Because Raab went on to deliver a long thank-you to all the NHS staff, care workers, hospital cleaners, delivery drivers and supermarket staff who were keeping people alive and the country running: the very people who would never have been let into the country if the home secretary had been allowed to implement her points-based immigration system a few years earlier. For Priti, ideology is all. She didn’t vote to take back control to have an immigrant clean a hospital floor or operate a supermarket checkout.“We now know who the key workers really are,” said Raab. Indeed we did. And to the surprise of many Tory MPs, they weren’t the hedge-fund managers or party donors they had imagined. Here Raab’s legendary ability to dissociate came in handy. Because back in 2010, he, Patel and several other leading Tories wrote a book, Britannia Unchained, in which they advocated increased austerity, doubling down on laissez-faire economics and branded the Brits as some of the idlest people in the world.But some things don’t change. Asked if the government might care to show its gratitude to the key workers with a cash bonus once the pandemic was over, Raab became evasive. Money, what money? Wasn’t it enough for these workers to have saved the country before being asked to leave? At times like these, Dom could almost be a double for David Brent. “The bad news is that some of you will lose your jobs. On a more positive note, the good news is that I’ve been promoted – so every cloud, eh?”Not that Raab seemed overly keen to emphasise the extent of his new powers as de facto prime minister. If anything, he tried to downplay them, suggesting that all cabinet decisions were now more like tantric meditation sessions. Unfortunately, the answers provided by that process can be less than crystal clear. Raab was as evasive on what the government strategy for determining the timing of the end of the partial lockdown might be – journalists have long since given up asking for an actual date – as he was on why the government had had to increase its overdraft with the Bank of England. Where was Rishi when you needed him?You could almost sense the desperation in Dom’s voice as he pleaded one last time for calm over Easter. Being in charge isn’t nearly so much fun as he had imagined. He’s missing Boris badly. Weirdly, I am too. At least with Boris you get some kind of hopeful bollocks. With Raab you just get bollocks.

We must keep going,” he said.“It’s been almost three weeks and we’re starting to see the impact of the sacrifices we’ve all made. But the deaths are still rising and we haven’t yet reached the peak of the virus. So it’s still too early to lift the measures that we put in place. We must stick to the plan and we must continue to be guided by the science.” Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200408-57750-gnl.sci.20200409.ms.covid_19_lockdown.mp3 Downing Street has repeatedly refused to set out the options for how the UK could end the lockdown, but insisted that the government was doing “extensive work” on the various possibilities.The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “Work is underway on an exit strategy but the public wants us to be focused on stopping the spread of the disease while building up the NHS and saving lives … Whitehall is working extensively on this but the peak is not reached and the government needs to focus in its public messaging on staying at home to save lives.”Officials acknowledge it could be difficult to rank sectors according to their importance to the economy, how much social contact they involve and the strength of their protective measures to keep people apart.But they said it was more possible than other ideas that have been floated in recent days, such as letting 20 to 30-year-olds go back to their normal lives before older people.Other ideas that have been raised by government scientists include “alternating between periods of more and less strict social distancing measures” for most of the year or providing “immunity passports” to those who have had the disease, although that would only work with a functioning home antibody test.The lockdown measures – which were announced on 23 March – were first scheduled to be reviewed after three weeks, on Easter Monday. The legislation drawn up to implement the lockdown must be reviewed at least once every 21 days, making 16 April the latest this can be done.Raab chaired a Cobra emergency committee on Thursday afternoon to discuss the lockdown with leaders of the devolved nations and the mayor of London. He said on Thursday evening that the government did not expect to say more about the possible easing of physical distancing measures until the end of next week.It is understood that tightening the lockdown is under greater consideration at this point, although Priti Patel, the home secretary, told TalkRadio on Thursday that the government was “absolutely not” considering any further physical distancing measures.One official said some Tory ministers and advisers have been pushing for the lockdown to end sooner rather than later, but that the current thinking was that it would have to last for another six to eight weeks.Boris Johnson’s hospital admission and spell in intensive care had undermined the case of those pushing for schools and workplaces to soon get back to normal, the source said.Industry leaders were briefed at the end of last week on the government’s ideas about a possible sector-by-sector approach when the lockdown ends, with manufacturing, logistics and food supply companies likely to be at the front of the queue if they are not still open already.One person familiar with the government’s thinking said that the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, was concerned about the idea, fearing compliance with the rules would collapse once the public could see workers from some sectors returning to a more normal life.The government’s scientific advisers remain particularly concerned about the risk of a second wave of infections if the rules are relaxed too soon, the source said – but Whitehall officials are conscious of the prime minister’s desire to see them loosened as soon as possible.Johnson and his ministers have acknowledged that widespread testing will be part of the answer, but the scientific advisers have said the capacity to roll out mass testing for live cases across the population is unlikely.Labour is pushing for the government to publish an exit strategy even though the end of the lockdown is likely to be some way off, as the public would need to have confidence in the approach and time to get used to the idea.Nick Thomas-Symonds, the recently appointed shadow home secretary, said: “While we acknowledge the difficulty in putting precise times on the strategy, one of the key reasons publication is necessary is to enable frontline emergency services to plan effectively.“This is especially important in areas such as policing, where clear plans will need to be in place to ensure a managed process. That is why I urge the home secretary to help get an exit strategy published, as it’s a vital part of securing public confidence in the government’s approach.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f588250368e92ebfa523cc52642da69d166e30d/0_0_3063_1838/master/3063.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02582ec35c4a061237de1761583b6c42","title":"april pink full moon readers photos of the supermoon","story":"A supermoon happens when the moon reaches the closest point to Earth in its 27-day orbit and it happens to be full, which usually occurs once a year.

What options are available?Young workers are among the most resilient to the virus, but often the hardest hit financially. A “youth first” policy would aim to release them first, at least in part, so they can get back to work and soften the financial impact of the epidemic. Research from Warwick University this week made the case for easing restrictions on people in their 20s and 30s who no longer live with their parents. Andrew Oswald and Nattavudh Powdthavee estimate that the move would allow 4.2m people to return work, 2.6m of whom are in the private sector, and get the economy moving again. “A young workforce release of this kind would lead to substantial economic and societal benefits without enormous health costs to the country,” the authors write.As recent deaths have shown, however, the young are not impervious to the disease. The Warwick group calculate that their youth-first policy could lead to 630 premature deaths. But if all goes well, others could follow them back to the workplace, their order determined by age and type of work.Shutting schools reduces the spread of coronavirus among pupils and teachers breaking up the social bonds that inevitably build up between parents. But it has a significant impact on economic activity, as so many working parents need time off for childcare and home schooling.An influential review published this week found a “remarkable dearth” of data on the value of school closures during the outbreaks of Sars and Mers, but noted that the measure seemed to have relatively little impact on the spread of those coronaviruses.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.More sophisticated options are available than simply reopening schools en masse, which would risk fuelling a second wave of infections. A more cautious approach may see schools staggering their opening hours, lunch and break times, keeping playgrounds closed and class groups constant, introducing more space between students and having a shorter school week.There is a case for opening primary schools first: they tend to be smaller than secondaries and it is predominantly younger children who keep adults from working. That said, the impact of closures on mental health and education are more severe for secondary students.“One problem is that we don’t have much information to guide us,” said Professor Russell Vine at UCL, an author of the review. “We need to get the clever modellers looking at this, and looking at how these might interact with other elements. But I think society also need to discuss it.” Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200408-57750-gnl.sci.20200409.ms.covid_19_lockdown.mp3 Britain desperately wants an effective antibody test that reveals who has had the virus. Those who test positive for coronavirus antibodies will presumably have some immunity and in principle might be allowed back to work. It could make a dramatic difference for NHS staff and other carers who work with vulnerable people.Immunity passports are not straightforward, though. A positive antibody test does not mean someone is well protected, or protected for long. What the immune response means in the case of this particular disease is still unknown. Another concern with immunity passports is that they blur the rules of the lockdown and encourage others to take the restrictions less seriously.A gradual easing of restrictions on shops and businesses would help the economy, but the spectre of a second wave of infections is ever present. Certain types of shops could reopen, but with strict limits on hours and numbers. The construction and manufacturing industries have already been sent new guidance from Alok Sharma, the business secretary, who said work could continue if done in line with social distancing rules “wherever possible”.Health officials will be watching European countries that are stating to relax their own lockdowns. In Austria, where new cases have been falling for some days, the schools will remain closed, but small shops, DIY and garden centres are due to reopen after Easter.• Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a8bdbd7d0e8cd314d0ffac60af831a2e1195ad7/0_63_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22d257f19fec2367990c4c26c7efd05f","title":"uk food waste charity fareshare donations lockdown","story":"FareShare says surplus food donations have more than doubled in lockdownThe volume of food that would otherwise be wasted received every week by the UK’s largest food redistribution charity has more than doubled since the coronavirus lockdown.In a better-than-average “good week” FareShare would typically be given 350 tonnes of food via its 24 regional distribution centres, but this has soared to 711 tonnes a week after the government ordered the closure of millions of hospitality businesses around the country, it has revealed.The organisation takes good quality surplus food from across the industry – direct from suppliers as well as from supermarkets – and redistributes it to almost 11,000 frontline charities and community groups. This typically provides 1m meals a week to vulnerable and needy people, along with essentials for regional food banks run by the Trussell Trust and smaller local projects.Its chief executive, Lindsay Boswell, said the organisation had “ripped up” its business model in order to adjust to the unprecedented disruption to the food and drink supply chain triggered by the outbreak of the coronavirus.“It’s been real plate-spinning,” said Boswell. “In the early phase we suffered from a complete collapse in food donations as shoppers rushed out to panic buy and demand soared. That was very worrying. Then the government’s decision to close food service companies opened the floodgates.“With diminishing numbers of volunteers due to self-isolation we had to channel all our resources into making sure it was collected on time and not wasted.” Without social distancing restrictions the organisation would probably be tripling its flow of food, he estimates. There has also been a switch in focus from providing food for meals to assembling food parcels.Boswell says virtually all donations have been gratefully received although there had been some “well-motivated offers, including a pantechnicon full of iceberg lettuces” which could not be used due to a massive amount of existing salad crop. Even before the outbreak of the coronavirus, demand for surplus food had soared against a background of growing dependence on food banks and rising homelessness in the UK.But wholesalers have been struggling to deal with tens of thousands of tonnes of fruit and vegetables, fresh meat and dairy products no longer required by restaurants, hotels and schools.As much as £20m of food with a shelf life of less than three months was at one stage lying in warehouses, according to the Federation of Wholesale Distributors, after the government ordered the closure of millions of hospitality businesses around the country.In London FareShare has partnered with the capital’s two other major food redistribution charities – City Harvest and the Felix Project – to provide a more targeted emergency response service for Londoners during the coronavirus crisis. The three organisations have formed the London Food Alliance, with each taking the lead in a designated borough to help distribute food to people in local communities.It is now boosting its 1,500-strong army of volunteers, helped by a new partnership with the British Red Cross, and in a single week it received more volunteer applications than for the whole of last year. “We regard many new volunteers as the fifth cavalry – we may not need you now but we will,” said Boswell. A call for experienced forklift operators led to 24 qualified people responding within just 24 hours.As well as routinely supplying surplus food, FareShare’s major supermarket partners are also providing “top up” food as well as funding to help with logistics. This week the Co-op convenience store chain scrapped its £2.5m Easter advertising campaign and will instead use the airtime to encourage viewers to donate to FareShare."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/358f05c033c7fed77e6c33337e09d9486a46d59d/0_70_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91176f87a5d0c33fbc5b8e6d877e6fc8","title":"andy murray virtual madrid open tennis covid 19","story":"Andy Murray will swap a tennis racket for a games controller when he takes part in a virtual Madrid Open later this month.The Scot and Lucas Pouille were announced as the first two ATP players in the draw on Thursday night, as the tennis world raises money during the coronavirus pandemic. The Madrid Open was scheduled to be held from 1-10 May but has been postponed as both the ATP and WTA Tours have shut down their calendars until at least the middle of July because of the global crisis.However, the clay-court tournament has decided to create an esports replica of its event titled the Mutua Madrid Open Virtual Pro which will take place from 27-30 April, with Murray and Pouille taking part.Pouille told the official ATP website: “This is going to be a very exciting challenge. I’ve already started training because I want to win this tournament against my tennis peers as I know they play a lot. Thank you to the Mutua Madrid Open for this great initiative.”Male and female winners will both be given a prize fund of €150,000 (£132,000) and they will get to decide how much goes to tennis players facing financial hardship without any tournaments to enter.

Giles, the England team director, believes his players will be ready for action despite the uncertainty and being restricted to only one trip out per day for exercise.“We have to hang on to the hopewe will get out there and we will play,” Giles said. “It’s looking less and less likely that we’re going to be out there in June so we have to look at alternatives.“The one thing I ask of the players is there is no real excuse why you can’t keep yourself fit during this period. You could be jumping up and down in your front room, you can still go for a jog, you can use your home equipment – there’s a range of stuff so that our players are ready when we get that green light.”England’s medical team have told Giles four to eight weeks of conditioning are still required before a player can go from lockdown to playing international cricket. The catch here is what form the domestic game takes on resumption, with priority given to the T20 Blast and uncertainty over the County Championship.It means England’s red-ball cricketers may be forced to stage inter-squad matches to tune up, something Australia claimed to benefit from last year when they played among themselves in Southampton before an Ashes series they went on to draw.Giles said: “I think that would be a decent way around a problem if we weren’t playing cricket more broadly. All 18 county grounds are still up and running and their ground staff are in preparing pitches. We will do whatever we can, as long as our people are safe, to play cricket.”Among the possible scenarios for a truncated season, given the West Indies tour is followed by visits from Australia, Pakistan and Ireland, is the prospect of England’s Test and one-day international teams playing concurrently. Giles said they must be amenable to this, even if he ruled out such matches occurring on the same day.With a World Test Championship under way but England’s white-ball side trying to tune up for a possible T20 World Cup in October, the selectors may face a balancing act. Giles hinted at Tests taking priority but there is a chance multi-format players may feature in both, depending on the workload.On the subject of England’s centrally contracted players donating £500,000 to the coffers and good causes – a precursor to the wider county game accepting pay cuts and use of the government furlough scheme in places – Giles said: “I’m very proud of our players, full stop. I think they are fantastic role models and what they’ve done in terms of contribution was strong. It’s important from a number of different aspects."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/506390da2f8b0e51e11d286c581d64db3b3ac8a0/481_175_1468_881/master/1468.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95159c72ea2dbe4cac415936ae4c0879","title":"ap mccoy grand national dont push it interview","story":"Ten years to the day since he won on Don’t Push It, does AP McCoy feel like a decade has passed since his greatest achievement?“It’s scary how quick these things go,” says Sir Anthony McCoy, reflecting on the fact it is 10 years to the day on Friday since he won the Grand National on Don’t Push It, widely regarded as the crowning achievement of his extraordinary career in the saddle. Now 45, the jockey who never really wanted to quit is five years into retirement and well established in a new career as a TV pundit.Does it feel like a decade has passed? He laughs down the phone. “Some days, yeah. I woke up this morning, me back was sore. I thought, yeah, it does feel like 10 years ago.” The great man is lucky enough to have horses at home and a bit of land he can work on in this time of lockdown. The only thing he has driven for a fortnight is a JCB, which he is using to put in new drains and to improve his gallops. He sounds almost grateful to be taking a break for a bit of reminiscing.The Grand National was the race that made AP wait, long after he had come to dominate jump racing by sheer force of will. A bit of back pain would be the least he would expect in the mornings back then, when it sometimes seemed he was held together by the silks he was wearing. But however battered he might look he could be relied on for another three winners at Taunton before driving to Sedgefield to do it again the next day. He was champion for an unbroken, unprecedented 20-year spell.“I’ve won a few races nobody knows about,” he joked at the time. Anyone who followed jump racing knew exactly what he was achieving, and punters in particular loved his unquenchable thirst, believing he would never give up, even if he had 20 lengths to make from the fourth-last in a selling hurdle at Market Rasen.But, in terms of his standing with the wider public, there was a nagging sense that his thousands of winners might not add up to a whole lot if he couldn’t do it on the one day each year when they were watching. “I was lucky enough to have done a lot of other things in racing,” he says. “I’ll always say the Gold Cup is the pinnacle of it, but if you tell the man in the street that you’re a jockey, they want to know if you’ve won the Grand National.“I used to comfort myself, thinking, look at the lads: John Francome, Jonjo O’Neill, Peter Scudamore, Charlie Swan, Frank Berry – multiple champion jockeys who never won a National. I used to think every day: ‘Ah well, they didn’t win the National so I’m not in bad company, they’re better than I was.’ And there were a lot of lads that definitely weren’t as good as any of those that did win the National …”Shoring up your self-confidence is important if you are to last as a professional athlete, so those rationalisations were absolutely necessary as the years rolled by and Aintree kept baring its teeth at McCoy. It took him six rides in the race before he completed the course and even that required him to remount Blowing Wind, who was balked by a loose horse at the 19th and dropped his jockey in the ditch.Four years later, another loose horse carried Clan Royal off the course when he was leading at Becher’s Brook the second time round. That was McCoy’s 10th ride in the National. The next four years were not quite so traumatic but still fruitless. Oh, well. Some things just aren’t meant to be.The 2010 race did not seem to hold particular promise. A few weeks beforehand, McCoy was mulling over a choice of four mounts and did not seem especially thrilled by any of them, though he was prepared to make allowances for Don’t Push It’s flop at the Cheltenham Festival.“There were other Grand National mornings that I was more excited, like before I was riding Blowing Wind or Clan Royal or Butler’s Cabin. I’d genuinely thought they might win.” Don’t Push It had had his moments, even in defeat, like the 2006 novice chase when McCoy had told the owner JP McManus: “He’ll win today.” They were beaten three parts of a length by some beast called Denman, who hammered Kauto Star in the Gold Cup 16 months later.Jonjo O’Neill, trainer of Don’t Push It, needed little prompting to reel off a list of the horse’s ailments, including “kissing spines and bad stifles”. McCoy described his mount as “mentally unstable”. They tried ear plugs as a means of keeping him calm during the buildup but he still sweated up at the start.It was at about this point that David Casey, on Snowy Morning, noticed from a bookmaker’s board that Don’t Push It had halved in price from the morning 20-1 as casual punters lined up behind his famous rider. Casey pointed it out to McCoy and asked mischievously: “How are you going to explain getting beat on another Grand National favourite?” Relaxed and with no great expectations, McCoy joined in the joking. But when the tape went up a few minutes later it didn’t take long for things to become interesting.“I genuinely thought, going out on the second circuit: ‘My God, this horse is loving this.’ I was thinking, well you’re not going to win if you get brought down, so keep him out of the way of everything else, try and get him round and if you’re there at the Canal Turn …“I couldn’t believe how he turned there, really tight. From there, I thought, fuck, this horse could win.” The one still to beat was Black Apalachi, but that rival had helped force a strong pace from an early stage, a detail that had not escaped the hawk-eyed McCoy as he smuggled Don’t Push It into contention. The runner-up proved remarkably game but there was little doubt about the outcome for the last quarter-mile.“There was a lot of relief and obviously a lot of satisfaction,” says McCoy, whose post-career status is undoubtedly higher because he finally conquered Aintree. To his way of thinking, he achieved much more in breaking Sir Gordon Richards’s 55-year-old record for winners in a season. “But it would never have led to people very kindly voting for me to win something like Sports Personality of the Year.“That’s the difference. There were 4.8 million watching the virtual Grand National the other day. Only 1.2 million watched the Gold Cup, which is the best race of the year. What’s the world coming to? The Grand National is a Wimbledon, it’s an FA Cup, one of those marquee events that will always be more powerful than all the others.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/542725b4838c0b28c5e31d90066d0991dce0fb02/37_401_3268_1961/master/3268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aed7a0e20f724a803ff23ba1ac6b3362","title":"samantha barks stephanie mckeon frozen london","story":"The pair will play sisters Elsa and Anna in the stage version of the Disney mega-hit when the Theatre Royal Drury Lane reopens later this yearSamantha Barks and Stephanie McKeon have been cast as sisters Elsa and Anna in the London stage version of Frozen.

There’s no headphones socket though.The camera lump has grown on the back, mirroring that used on the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, featuring a dual camera system and the lidar scanner – more on those in a moment.The Apple A12Z Bionic processor is the same as the A12X Bionic used in the 2018 iPad Pro, but with an eight-core GPU instead of seven. It performs the same: fast and smooth.Apple says the iPad Pro is more powerful than many full-blown computers certainly Affinity Photo was faster performing the same complex edits on the iPad Pro than on the new MacBook Air with an Intel Core i3 chip.Battery life wasn’t quite as good as the previous model when tested in 2018. The new iPad Pro manages more than eight hours of constant work between charges enough for day’s work and watching a video on the commute home but not quite the 1.5 days working-day battery that 2018’s model managed.Part of this discrepancy could be explained by the upgrade from iOS 12 to the more capable iPadOS 13.4, which does more, often concurrently, so will be more power hungry – but also more useful. With lighter use, such as reading or watching offline movies, the iPad Pro lasts well over nine hours between charges.Charging the 12.9in iPad Pro with the included folding 18W charger took three hours 20 minutes from flat. Using 45W charger shaved more than an hour off that time.Apple does not give a rated lifecycle for the iPad Pro, typically 500 full-charge cycles, but it can be replaced for £99. The tablet is generally repairable, with the out-of-warranty service cost being £616.44, which includes the screen. The iPad Pro was only awarded a three out of 10 for repairability by the specialist iFixit.Apple also offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.Since splitting iOS into iPadOS for Apple’s tablets and iOS for its smartphones, the iPad line has gained significant utility more befitting of a tablet computer.The big new addition for iPadOS 13.4 is Bluetooth or USB-C mouse and trackpad support, an update available for a large range of iPads, not just the iPad Pro.You don’t quite get a mouse pointer on-screen like a Mac. Instead you get a morphing blob that changes shape when near actionable items. A caret appears when over text like a Mac, but when you go near a button the cursor jumps to it, morphing into a light-grey rectangle highlighting the button. This instant selection reduces the precision required to click something obvious.A trackpad is the best option for the iPad as it opens up a load of gestures many of which are similar to those on a Mac. Highlights include two-finger scrolling, threefourfive-finger swipes replicating iPadOS’s navigation gestures (up for home etc), and a five-finger pinch to see recently used apps. You can even two-finger or right click, which brings up what would be the tap-and-hold menu on icons and items.The interface and cursor have a bit a momentum too. For instance, you can click the time to get to notifications or battery icon to get to quick settings, or you can fling the cursor to each respective cursor with a bit of force instead. To bring up the dock you need to fling the cursor to the bottom of the screen. It’s surprisingly fun, if using a cursor on a screen could ever be described as such.Not all the usual interactions you expect are supported, such as a lack of hover-over for tool tips, which stops some functions in web apps from working. Some buttons also refuse to click, such as the back arrow in Evernote. Clearly, some third-party app developers will need to do some work.Overall, trackpad and mouse support is fairly transformative for the iPad Pro as a work machine attached to a keyboard. It adds much-needed precision for text selection, working in spreadsheets and other office duties, while also reducing the strain of constant prodding of the screen.The big new hardware addition to the iPad Pro for 2020 is a new dual-camera setup, similar to that used on the iPhone 11, and a lidar sensor.The cameras are good for a tablet, but not as good as those on the iPhone 11. Fine for random snaps, but a phone is likely better for keepsakes.The front-facing 7-megapixel camera is excellent for video calls – infinitely better than those fitted to Apple’s laptops. I wish it was fitted to the top in landscape, rather than portrait, which would be far better for use in a keyboard case.The lidar sensor aids augmented reality (AR) apps. It measures the distance to objects up to 5 metres away, allowing more accurate placement of virtual objects into the real world, particularly when they’re placed behind real objects.The measure app, for instance, is more accurate, as is Ikea’s furniture visualisation app. Other than the occasional points of interest, I have yet to be convinced of AR experiences through a tablet or a phone.Therefore lidar feels like a future-proofing addition that will be useful at some stage, once apps that can truly take advantage of it have appeared.The 2020 iPad Pro comes in space grey or silver, in two screen sizes, four storage options and versions with or without 4G.The 2020 iPad Pro is very much the 2018 model plus added cameras and lidar.It’s a feature that improves AR and may prove transformative down the line. But AR on a tablet remains niche.Instead the big changes are software as part of iPadOS 13.4, which is also available for older models. It makes the iPad Pro more of a full computer replacement than ever.I can finally get every part of my work done on the tablet, without resorting to hacky work-arounds or finishing on a PC. This review was written and edited, the photos imported and edited, and finally the lot inserted into the ’s backend systems, something I’ve simply not been able to do before all on an iPad.The 12.9in screen was big enough not to feel cramped, while some tasks were faster and others slower than when working on a Mac or PC. But, finally, the answer to the ever-present question hanging over the iPad Pro of “can you get real work done on an iPad” is: yes. And without massive adjustments too.It may not be much different from the last one, but the 2020 iPad Pro is the very best mobile tablet you can buy – which it absolutely should be for at least £969 for the 12.9in version – and arguably a solid laptop or PC replacement.Cons: very expensive, no kickstand without case, no headphone socket, will still need a PC for some tasks This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Sex life gone from G-spot to pee spot? The London Clinic’s Jane Simpson explains what we can do to tackle incontinence – including kegel exercises that you can do wherever you are As a continence nurse specialist, I’ve seen firsthand how overwhelming and upsetting incontinence can be. Patients visit me when things have gone too far – their behaviours change and they’re suddenly avoiding activities such as playing tennis, having sex or even going to the cinema because they’re worried about having to race to the toilet. When you start avoiding things you enjoy, it’s time to take action.Of course, leakage can be troubling at any moment, but during sex it’s particularly distressing (it tends to happen during an orgasm or because of the physical pressure). But the good news is, it doesn’t mean the end of your sex life. In fact, patients always say they wish they’d sought treatment sooner. Even if you don’t experience leakage, sexual sensation and satisfaction can be improved, too – and who wouldn’t want that? As well as increasing blood supply to the vagina and penis, pelvic floor muscle training (or “kegels”, as they’re also known), can improve muscle tone and maintain nerve activity, meaning better sex.When it comes to treatment for accidental leakage, it depends on the type of incontinence people are dealing with. “Stress incontinence” is when we suffer leakage while doing things such as sneezing, coughing or laughing, and it’s common for women to experience this after having a baby, when the pelvic floor is weakest. Leaking during sports or sex falls under this category, due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. The other common type is an overactive bladder, or “urge incontinence”, which feels like you have to urinate suddenly and often.Pelvic floor exercises can help in both instances, but it’s really important to make sure you’re doing them properly – speak to a women’s health physiotherapist or a continence specialist if unsure. They’re simple – just squeeze, lift and hold the anus and vagina, count to five and repeat five times. Improvement is fast – you’ll notice a change in six weeks if you do them regularly. There’s also a brilliant app called MyPFF, which reminds you to do your exercises.If an overactive bladder is the problem, lifestyle changes are key – symptoms can be worsened by too much caffeine, alcohol, fizzy drinks, spicy foods and stress, for example. Certain medications can also play a part, as well as conditions such as constipation, urinary tract infections and vaginal atrophy. Bladder retraining is great – when you have an urge to pee, you teach yourself to hang on, which slowly expands your bladder capacity. It might also be worth avoiding high-impact sports until your pelvic floor is stronger, since too much exercise can make things worse. Medication and surgery could be considered with a specialist, too.I definitely sense a change coming in the way we discuss women’s health issues and incontinence, and it’s great the conversation is becoming more open. There shouldn’t be any shame or stigma around it any more – this sort of condition affects so many of us. I hope people realise improvement is possible and that once the issue is tackled, it really can be life-changing. Recently, a woman visited me in my clinic and said that just having a treatment plan in place has made her feel better. It really is the very least we deserve.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life.

There he encountered a strange mermaid-like creature. “I am Amabie who lives in the sea,” it said. “For the next six years, there will be abundant crops across the land, but there will also be epidemics. Show my picture to people as soon as you can.” Then Amabie was gone.The story circulated in newspapers – as did copycat sightings, including one of a land-based, ape-like version in 1876.Later depictions included, notably, Shigeru Mizuki’s ghosts and ghouls-filled manga GeGeGe no Kitaro (1960-69).Though Mizuki passed away in 2015, his production company tweeted his drawing of Amabie on 17 March, with the words: “May the modern epidemic disappear.”Wishful thinking maybe, but that one tweet sparked Twitter hashtags such as #amabiechallenge and #amabieforeveryone. While some users, including manga artists such as Mari Okazaki, have been sharing paintings and drawings of Amabie, other Twitter users have been more creative, posting pictures of embroidery, bowls of udon (thick wheat noodles) and bento lunchboxes all inspired by the apparition. Some have even dressed themselves (and their pets) up like Amabie and tweeted the photos alongside their own hopeful messages. And now Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has enlisted Amabie for an awareness flyer it tweeted, urging people to “stop the spread of infection.”The hope — and sometimes humour — that accompanies each depiction is real, and Amabie has become a unifying force that has Japan reaching deep into its own obscure past to find solace in uncertain times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41415719520b6e1bc09fca326ff0959fd2b7ff32/0_0_3053_1832/master/3053.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=843b1c39cac6f17e64e35590bda663a5","title":"five best virtual festivals djs party easter weekend","story":"A big night out may be off the cards, but DJs and musicians will keep the party going this bank holiday weekend by livestreaming into our homesLivestreaming from the homes of bands and DJs around the UK, DIY magazine is hosting a virtual festival from Friday to Sunday (2pm-10pm BST).

About 60 people – including in-house experts, researchers and production team members – collaborate to bring a single episode to air.As coronavirus closes at least 124,000 schools across the countryand millions of parents are thrust into the position of full-time caregivers, here is Sesame Street’s advice for parents, teachers and children. Unfortunately, a spiraling health crisis that has overwhelmed hospitals and required families to shelter in place has made it all but impossible to say what’s coming next.So how do parents create routine in an unpredictable moment?“Flexibility is the key word,” said Truglio. “All children do best with structure, but we also need to be flexible if plans go awry.”The trick for parents, said Truglio, is to stick to the routines that are within control. Keep to night-time rituals like brushing teeth and reading bedtime stories whenever possible. Find regular times for children to focus on schoolwork. Days may feel frantic, but small moments of structure can help create a sense of normalcy.If plans don’t work out, pivot. If it rains, move a picnic to the living room. If you miss a morning reading activity, do it in the afternoon. And just as importantly, let children see that you’re capable of adapting when plans come apart. Handling frustration and disappointment is a crucial piece of child development.“Building resilience is key,” Truglio said. “We don’t know how long this is going to last. We all have to be resilient.”The good news for parents is that children learn best through everyday moments.In her book Sesame Street: Ready for School! A Parent’s Guide to Playful Learning for Children Ages 2 to 5, Truglio writes about turning everyday tasks into learning moments. Enlisting kids to create a shopping list can be a way to use the alphabet and build vocabulary. Building towers with blocks can mean talking about shapes, width and height. Cooking dinner or doing laundry is a chance to practice math and measurements.A key, said Truglio, is to make learning playful. “Lean in and follow your child’s interest,” she said.“What’s not good is to do flashcards and rote learning. It’s not very interesting. When children are playing, they’re activated, they’re invested in the learning. When they are trying to solve a problem, they learn through trial and error. They learn not to give up.”The pandemic is presenting a new kind of trauma, explained Akimi Gibson, vice-president and education publisher at Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind Sesame Street. “This trauma is universal. It has no cultural or economic bias. And it caught us all equally by surprise,” Gibson said. .Research attests to the negative impact trauma has on child development – whether it stems from poverty, a parent addicted to drugs, or a global outbreak. That’s why Sesame Street is leaning into the “for-now normal”, as the program creators are referring to the moment, by providing tips and resources for talking and listening to children in its recently launched “Caring for Each Other” initiative.“We have to realize this is a new way to look at trauma”, said Jeanette Betancourt, senior vice-president of Sesame Workshop’s US social impact. “But most importantly, we need to ask how we can best support children in the most traumatic times, when their voices are often lost.”If you listen closely, children will say what’s on their mind as they narrate their play, Truglio noted.Crucial for caregivers is to listen and help children understand it’s OK to be scared or uncertain. Thankfully, the support children will need to adapt looks a lot like what they have always needed.“Very important to young children are routines, but even more important is knowing that grown ups are there for me. We know what young children need: routine, stability and love. A pandemic doesn’t change that,” Betancourt said.Sesame Street is built around children, but its creators understand that adults need help, too. For them, Sesame Street’s message is simple: understand that you’re human and take a breath.“Parents can’t help children if they’re not taking care of themselves. It’s like oxygen on a plane. We want to make sure there’s resources there, but also to be kind to themselves,” Truglio said.For Sesame Street, that has meant providing educators with reliable learning resources at a time when they’re facing a glut of untested tip sheets and guides. For parents and caregivers, it has meant helping them understand they don’t have to become the teacher.“A parent has to be a caregiver, first and foremost,” Gibson said. “And the educator wants to maintain a status as teacher. The two are in it together for the interest of the child.”At no point do the makers of Sesame Street say any of this will be easy. But neither did they suggest the future has to be grim."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8409be2b0b4ec1eda112a66635a2edf9c5b0ea3/0_530_7952_4774/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b05325b670d808bf8a0e4abc3bd1b9e2","title":"america inequality laid bare coronavirus","story":"Millions of workers in the US were hanging on financially, in a system skewed against them. Then the coronavirus happened For years, Mary P was employed by a major firm, cleaning its executive offices in Kansas City. Then, out of the blue a decade ago, the mother of three was told she was working for a different company.Mary P would carry on cleaning the same offices, but over time, while executives whose desks she was polishing continued to enjoy the fruits of their company’s fortunes, she saw her pay erode, healthcare coverage diminish, and what had seemed a secure job turn into an ad hoc position with few protections.Then coronavirus made its appearance.“They told me to go home. They would call me if they needed me. I won’t get paid. The health insurance only lasts until the end of the month,” said Mary P, who did not wish to be identified because she hopes to return to her job.Had coronavirus hit 15 years ago, she reckons she would have been in the same position as those whose offices she cleaned – at home, collecting salaries, reassured by good health coverage if they fall sick. But now she is cut adrift.“I can apply for food stamps and unemployment, but it won’t pay the rent. I’m really afraid of what happens if I get sick. I will just have to stay home. I can’t afford to pay for a doctor,” she said.As millions of Americans apply for unemployment benefits, the coronavirus pandemic has brutally laid bare the extent of US’s growing inequality, not only between the super rich and the rest of the country, but in the quality of jobs and the social protections that come with them.Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, said: “It has drawn into focus those disparities in a way that it’s not just about jobs, it’s not just about wages. It’s about health and working conditions and access to health insurance. All of these things highlight that there’s two different societies in this country. Because of rising inequality, more people are vulnerable.”The US is not alone in face a huge surge in unemployment because of the pandemic. But American workers are particularly vulnerable because they have neither the welfare safety nets afforded by France or Germany, nor the public healthcare of the UK and Canada. The rise of outsourcing, contract work and gig economy jobs has seen ever increasing numbers of workers exposed to sudden economic shock, whether because of a financial crisis or a pandemic.Coronavirus has also thrown a spotlight on the president’s claims of a strong economy when so many American workers lack the resources to cope with even a brief period without work. A Federal Reserve survey last year said four in 10 workers would struggle to find $400 in an emergency, with out-of-pocket medical expenses presenting a particular hardship.Pat “Duke” Dujakovich, the president of the Greater Kansas City AFL-CIO union confederation, said large numbers of his members were suddenly put out of work and now face an uncertain future with many of them losing their healthcare coverage in the middle of a national medical emergency.Dujakovich, who was a firefighter for 30 years, said he saw what was to come on a single day after a series of concerts and sporting events in Kansas City were called off because of coronavirus.“Everything got cancelled on a Wednesday. Thursday, the stage hands tore down what they had already set up, and that is the last time any of them worked anywhere in the region. They were the first ones to go and they’ve been out of work for quite a while.”To Gould, the crisis has been deepened by companies shedding responsibility.“Part of this is about employers not taking responsibility for people that should really be on their books, whether or not they’re gig workers, contract workers, self-employed workers. Those people are actually employees and they should be treated like employees,” she said.Many of those workers lost their health insurance at the time they might most need it, with bills for coronavirus treatment potentially running into the tens of thousands of dollars. Laid-off workers are eligible to continue their coverage under a government scheme called Cobra. But Dujakovich said many would not be able to afford it.“I’m still trying to figure out how someone who just lost their job manages to scrape together $800 or a $1,000 a month to maintain those Cobra benefits,” he said. There is no way I have found for a person who is unemployed on their own to try to get healthcare in America. It just doesn’t exist. And so the only way is through employment.”But even those who still have jobs are vulnerable to inadequate protections.Gould said more than a quarter of private-sector workers in the US cannot claim paid time off for sickness.. That, she said, puts large numbers of people on low pay at increased risk of Covid-19, because many of them have little choice but to go on working, even if they show symptoms, increasing the likelihood of the virus spreading.“This virus exposes a vast inequality between the professional sector, white-collar workers, who are able to weather this at home with much less risk, have paid sick days if they need to take it, have health insurance,” said Gould. “And then there is another class of workers that has far fewer protections. Those that are more likely to be exposed because of their jobs, more likely to get sick, more likely have adverse consequences from getting sick because of rising inequality, because they don’t have paid sick days or health insurance.”Many of those same workers are also more likely to contract Covid-19 because they have jobs that bring them into contact with the public such as transport workers, shop assistants and carers, highlighted by the death of Jason Hargrove, a Detroit bus driver.Two weeks ago, Hargrove posted a Facebook video venting his anger at a passenger who coughed in his face several times.“For you to get on the bus, and stand on the bus, and cough several times without covering up your mouth, and you know that we’re in the middle of a pandemic, that lets me know that some folks don’t care,” he said.The 50 year-old father of six contracted coronavirus and died 11 days later.Gould said this goes some way to explain why African American communities have been so badly hit. Many black workers have jobs that make it difficult to isolate while minority communities also endure higher levels of medical conditions – diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure – that make people more vulnerable to coronavirus. African American communities also have a harder time obtaining good healthcare.“Even if they’re OK to go to work, and they’re healthy and strong, they could still be bringing home that disease to elderly family members or to family members that are at higher risk with heart conditions, with their asthma or whatever it might be.” Dujakovich said that while those at the top are better able to insulate themselves from coronavirus, he told a told a meeting of national AFL-CIO leaders that they will not be able to avoid its consequences.“I said right now the bankers don’t give a fuck about working people, but they’re going to give a fuck about us very shortly. When we stop making car payments and house payments and rent and all of those things, because working people have to prioritise,” he said.“When the first pay cheque is missed and the second pay cheque is questionable and the third pay cheque is really questionable, then you have to kind of think of things as to what can kill me first. I need to feed my family this week.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/835ca0de47d1b0c4f370afaa524e8be3d0abcf2d/1075_407_1233_740/master/1233.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d786d2fecdcdda8a766f5957be0982d7","title":"how did the coronavirus start where did it come from how did it spread humans was it really bats pangolins wuhan animal market","story":"It’s likely Covid-19 originated in bats, scientists say. But did it then spread to pangolins and humans?In the public mind, the origin story of coronavirus seems well fixed: in late 2019 someone at the now world-famous Huanan seafood market in Wuhan was infected with a virus from an animal.The rest is part of an awful history still in the making, with Covid-19 spreading from that first cluster in the capital of China’s Hubei province to a pandemic that has killed about 80,000 people so far.Stock footage of pangolins – a scaly mammal that looks like an anteater – have made it on to news bulletins, suggesting this animal was the staging post for the virus before it spread to humans.But there is uncertainty about several aspects of the Covid-19 origin story that scientists are trying hard to unravel, including which species passed it to a human. They’re trying hard because knowing how a pandemic starts is a key to stopping the next one.Prof Stephen Turner, head of the department of microbiology at Melbourne’s Monash University, says what’s most likely is that virus originated in bats.But that’s where his certainty ends, he says.On the hypothesis that the virus emerged at the Wuhan live animal market from an interaction between an animal and a human, Turner says: “I don’t think it’s conclusive by any means.”“Part of the problem is that the information is only as good as the surveillance,” he says, adding that viruses of this type are circulating all the time in the animal kingdom.The fact that the virus has infected a tiger in a New York zoo shows how viruses can move around between species, he says. “Understanding the breadth of species this virus can infect is important as it helps us narrow down down where it might have come from.”Scientists say it is highly likely that the virus came from bats but first passed through an intermediary animal in the same way that another coronavirus – the 2002 Sars outbreak – moved from horseshoe bats to cat-like civets before infecting humans.One animal implicated as an intermediary host between bats and humans is the pangolin. The International Union for Conservation of Nature says they are “the most illegally traded mammal in the world” and are prized for their meat and the claimed medicinal properties of their scales.As reported in Nature, pangolins were not listed on the inventory of items being sold in Wuhan, although this omission could be deliberate as it’s illegal to sell them.“Whether the poor pangolin was the species at which it jumped, it’s not clear,” Turner says. “It’s either mixed in something else, mixed in a poor pangolin, or it’s jumped into people and evolved in people.”Prof Edward Holmes, of the University of Sydney, was a co-author on a Nature study that examined the likely origins of the virus by looking at its genome. On social media he has stressed that the identity of the species that served as an intermediate host for the virus is “still uncertain”.One statistical study looked at a characteristic of the virus that evolved to enable it to latch on to human cells. Pangolins were able to develop this characteristic, but so were cats, buffalo, cattle, goats, sheep and pigeons.Another study claimed to have ruled out pangolins as an intermediary altogether, because samples of similar viruses taken from pangolins lacked a chain of amino acids seen in the virus now circulating in humans.The study Holmes worked on suggested that the scenario in which a human at the Wuhan market interacted with an animal that carried the virus was only one potential version of the Covid-19 origin story. Another was the possibility that a descendent of the virus jumped into humans and then adapted as it was passed from human to human.“Once acquired, these adaptations would enable the pandemic to take off and produce a sufficiently large cluster of cases to trigger the surveillance system that detected it,” the study said.This might be another reason to doubt the established story.Prof Stanley Perlman, a leading immunologist at the University of Iowa and an expert on previous coronavirus outbreaks that have stemmed from animals, says the idea the link to the Wuhan market is coincidental “cannot be ruled out” but that possibility “seems less likely” because the genetic material of the virus had been found in the market environment.Perlman told  Australia he does believe there was an intermediary animal but adds that while pangolins are possible candidates, they “are not proven to be the key intermediary”.So-called wet markets – where live animals are traded – have been implicated in previous outbreaks of coronaviruses, in particular Sars.Dr Michelle Baker, an immunologist at CSIRO who studies viruses in bats, says some of the research on Covid-19’s origins have stepped off from what was known from the past.Baker says what is “very likely” is that the virus originated in a bat. “It’s a likely scenario but we will never know. The market was cleaned up quite quickly. We can only speculate.”“These wet markets have been identified as an issue because you do have species interacting,” she says. “It’s an opportunity to highlight the dangers of them and an opportunity to clamp down on them.”Turner adds: “We’ve found the ancestors of the virus, but having broader knowledge of the coronavirus in other species might give us a hint about the evolution of this thing and how it jumped.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9d75a980eca0780d38e071fe56d6f9abee40baa/0_136_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b14784ca6c9952df79dffef37e77a3d2","title":"uk coronavirus peak at least two weeks away chief scientist says","story":"Patrick Vallance says deaths likely to keep rising for fortnight after ICU situation improvesThe UK coronavirus death toll is expected to continue to rise for at least two weeks, the government’s chief scientific adviser has said, despite encouraging signs about the rate of infections and hospital admissions.Sir Patrick Vallance told Thursday’s daily Downing Street briefing that the number of people to have died from coronavirus in UK hospitals had reached 7,978, after the deaths of a further 881 people. It is the second-highest daily total after Wednesday’s record 938 deaths.Despite the slightly lower figure, Vallance said the peak of the outbreak could still be weeks away. “I would expect the deaths to continue to keep going up for about two weeks after the intensive care picture improves. We’re not there yet, but that’s the sort of timeframe I would expect.”The chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, pointed out that two weeks ago admissions to intensive care were doubling every three days. He said: “It’s now becoming not quite flat, but doubling time is now six or more days in almost every area in the country. That has only happened because of what everybody has done in terms of staying at home.”The official UK figure of 881 new deaths differs from the 891 total from figures released separately by agencies in the UK’s four countries, which gather their data differently. NHS England said a further 765 people had died, ranging in age from 24 to 103. Only 43 of those patients had no known underlying health condition.Scotland recorded 81 deaths, taking its total to 447. Unlike the rest of the UK, Scotland’s total includes some deaths outside hospitals because it counts all fatalities where Covid-19 is recorded as a cause on a death certificate.Wales recorded 41 deaths, taking its total to 286 and in Northern Ireland there were four more deaths, taking its total to 82.Last week the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the NHS was preparing for at least 1,000 deaths a day, at a time when scientific advisers were forecasting the outbreak to peak at Easter.The peak was now expected to come in four weeks, after signs that the transmission rate was beginning to fall. New infections continue to fluctuate. On Thursday, 4,344 new cases were recorded, compared with 5,492 on Wednesday, but the day-on-day rise was still higher than three of the previous four days.He added: “If deaths are still following a rapid exponential growth, today’s new deaths would have been expected to be markedly higher than yesterday’s, and the total number of deaths to date would have doubled from that four days ago. Most, if not all, the deaths reported today will have come from infections before the so-called ‘hard lockdown’. It does seem that the hard lockdown is, as expected, reducing the rate of increase in the number of new hospital admissions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/966b81ee4dfe1a92c87ab07a9dbb450df67631ae/0_783_5240_3145/master/5240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ef2928eb1ff4f9c798f0bdcd155e0ab","title":"awakening volcanic region reykjanes peninsula iceland disruption centuries","story":"Reykjanes peninsula’s last active period started in 10th century and lasted 300 yearsVolcanic activity is escalating in a region of Iceland that has not erupted for 800 years, with scientists warning it could cause disruption for centuries to come.Since 21 January, the Reykjanes peninsula to the south-west of Iceland’s capital Reykjavik has experienced more than 8,000 earthquakes and about 10cm of land uplift due to magma intrusions underground.“It seems that after being relatively inactive for many centuries, this region is waking up,” said Dave McGarvie, a volcanologist at Lancaster University. Situated close to the town of Grindavík and the popular Blue Lagoon tourist attraction, and only nine miles (15km) from Iceland’s international airport, the region last erupted about 800 years ago (though there have been more recent eruptions offshore). Geological evidence shows the area is fed by five volcanic systems, which seem to come to life in a coordinated way roughly every 1,000 years.The last period of volcanic activity on the peninsula began in the 10th century and continued until the 13th century. Unlike typical Icelandic volcanoes, which tend to wake for a few years and then die down, when this region gets going it appears to splutter on and off for up to 300 years, producing eruptive episodes (locally known as “fires”) lasting a few decades. Long thin cracks known as fissures extend up to five miles (8km), producing fountains of lava, usually without large amounts of ash or explosive activity.The most recent “fires” occurred between 1210 and 1240 and covered about 50km2 of land in lava. At least six separate eruptions occurred, each lasting weeks to months, interspersed with gaps of up to 12 years with no activity. Volcanic rock fragments and particles were carried tens of kilometres by the wind and the written sources report the rockfall causing problems for livestock in the area.If a similar series of eruptions occurred today, the Iceland GeoSurvey calculates that runways at Keflavík airport could be coated in 2cm of ash, temporarily halting all flights.“Wind direction during times of ash production is critical – anything with a slight northerly aspect is going to cause problems for the international airport and the metropolitan area of Reykjavík,” said McGarvie.“The worst case scenario is if lava flows towards the town of Grindavík,” said Kristín Jónsdóttir from the Icelandic Meteorological Office. “There is also other important infrastructure in the vicinity including a geothermal power plant. Hot and cold water supply may be at risk, along with roads, including the road between Reykjavík and Keflavík airport.”Icelanders are rarely fazed by volcanic activity, but they will be keeping a very close eye on the Reykjanes peninsula. Because the eruptions are likely to be relatively small and occasional they will be easier to cope with than massive and sudden outpourings of lava like the 1783-84 Laki eruption, but if the pattern is indeed about to repeat, it will present a new kind of challenge for Icelanders.“People on the Reykjanes peninsula, and their descendants for several generations, will have to be on their guard and ready to evacuate every so often,” said McGarvie."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0246147ac890dff176b2a8b6b453f5394b1cd10a/0_220_6702_4021/master/6702.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cb55b9bc94e694182a01a6ed93461a9","title":"chinese writer fang fang faces online backlash wuhan lockdown diary","story":"Internet users accuse Fang Fang of handing foreigners ‘a giant sword’ to attack ChinaA Chinese writer who published a diary during her time under lockdown in Wuhan has been subjected to widespread online criticism for publishing her book in English and German.Fang Fang has been accused of contributing to a negative international narrative on China’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.The popular Wuhan writer began chronicling the lockdown in late January, including criticism of the official response.“How many people have died in Wuhan and their families destroyed?” she wrote on 31 January. “But so far not a single person has said sorry or taken responsibility. I’ve even seen a writer use the phrase ‘complete victory’. What are they talking about?”Her posts were shared widely on social media even as each was quickly deleted by censors, according to the Diplomat magazine.Her Weibo account, which had more than 3.8 million followers, was shut down in February. It has since been reinstated.But her writing was picked up and turned into a book, due to be published by Harper Collins in June, translated and published in English and German.For publishing in the western languages, Fang Fang has been accused of helping foreign countries attack China, giving them “a giant sword”.China is in the midst of a western media campaign and soft diplomacy push to improve its reputation over its handling of the virus and accusations of underreporting statistics.“Wuhan Diary is a knife handed over to foreigners and a bullet shooting at Chinese,” said one poster on Weibo.Another wrote: “The woman only writes articles in her own small blog, and does not know the overall situation of our country at all. Maybe she does not admit that she is unpatriotic, she thought we were extreme, in fact she was just a stupid old lady.”On Weibo, “Fang Fang Diary” has had 380m views, 94,000 discussions, and 8,210 original posts, peaking last week. On Twitter, the hashtag #wuhandiary shows hundreds of critical posts.“The attack on Fang Fang is so vehement and hateful that it’s scary to watch,” said Li Yuan, a New York Times columnist. “Fang Fang herself said that it reminded her of the Cultural Revolution.”On Wednesday, China’s English-language state newspaper said it was “shameful” to see Fang Fang praised in western media that had been dedicated to defaming China’s pandemic response.Citing “observers”, the editorial said her diary was “biased and only exposes the dark side in Wuhan while ignoring the efforts that local people made and the support extended across the nation”.Additional reporting by Pei Lin Wu"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4a879b5b777ed05ea4f1750756bf84b8bb9b5b9/256_0_3306_1984/master/3306.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=267d5b0ae0318b76cd59d5dbb4bf37e7","title":"coronavirus good news upside blessings covid positive","story":"Though our blessings may be well disguised in this pandemic, we must still count them“Everything bad in life is eventually a blessing.”I’m not sure where I read this – it may well have been in this wonderful novel by Taffy Brodesser-Akner.

In the face of the Covid-19 pandemic we need to take the same kind of decisive action, yet western countries have appeared remarkably slow to do so, despite the advantages of immense scientific knowledge and modern tools of pandemic control.New Zealand now appears to be the only “western” nation following an articulated elimination strategy with the goal of completely ending transmission of Covid-19 within its borders. The strategy appears to be working, with new case numbers falling. Most cases are now returning travellers, who are safely quarantined at the borders, and the few remaining case clusters in the community are being traced and further spread stamped out. But it is far too soon to claim victory, and the country is remaining under an intense lockdown to support the elimination effort.New Zealand only embraced the elimination strategy in mid-March. Up until then, the country was taking a similar approach to Australia. Both countries were following their pandemic plans, which were based on managing influenza pandemics. Both were applying increasing border restrictions to “keep it out”, with controls increased after 15 March to require 14-day periods of self-isolation for all arrivals. Familiar methods of case isolation, contact tracing and quarantine to stamp out cases were also being used.But then the countries erged. On 23 March New Zealand committed to an elimination strategy. Both countries had relatively low case numbers at that time: New Zealand had reported 102 cases and no deaths and Australia had reported 1396 cases and 10 deaths. On that day the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced that New Zealand was going to rapidly escalate levels of physical distancing and travel restrictions, reaching the level of a full national lockdown on 26 March (level four on the alert scale).Taking an elimination approach is very different from mitigating pandemic influenza. With mitigation, the response is increased as the pandemic progresses, and more intensive interventions such as school closures are often held in reserve to “flatten the peak”. By contrast, disease elimination partly reverses the sequence by using vigorous interventions early to interrupt disease transmission.New Zealand needed this lockdown for several reasons. By effectively putting the country into mass home quarantine for a month it extinguished many chains of Covid-19 transmission. This period gave us much needed time to ramp up the critical measures required for elimination to work (more rigorous quarantine at the borders, expanded testing and contact tracing, and additional surveillance measures to provide assurance for when elimination had been achieved). It was probably also the only way to ensure the population would swiftly adhere to the physical distancing behaviours needed to extinguish chains of viral transmission. This is a population that has never experienced a major pandemic and had been barely affected by Sars, unlike many countries in Asia.A major driver of the New Zealand decision to pursue elimination was the increasing evidence that this was the least bad option. A turning point for some of us was reading the report on the WHO Mission to China showing that, in contrast to influenza, this disease was more like SARS and could be eliminated even after community transmission had been established. We also observed the relative success of a number of Asian jurisdictions in containing the Covid-19 pandemic, notably Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong.In western countries it was also becoming apparent that the mitigation strategy of “flattening the curve” was failing, as health services were being overwhelmed across Europe. Increasingly, these countries were switching to a suppression strategy, which would reduce cases to manageable levels but at the likely cost of a prolonged lock-down while waiting for an effective vaccine or antivirals.Theoretically, any jurisdiction could pursue elimination of Covid-19. It was even proposed for the US in a recent New England Journal of Medicine editorial. Countries where elimination is likely to be the most feasible are those which can manage their borders tightly, have the resources for the sustained high volumes of testing and contact tracing required, and which can implement the kinds of lockdowns that may be needed to eliminate chains of transmission. Australia meets those conditions and so the elimination strategy is still one of the possible options there. For many low and middle income countries elimination is unfortunately probably not an option at present.One critical success factor that is, unfortunately, harder to guarantee is high-quality political leadership. The brilliant, decisive and humane leadership of Ardern was instrumental in New Zealand’s rapid change in direction with its response to Covid-19 and the remarkably efficient implementation of the elimination strategy.The lockdown does, however, have massive short-term social and economic costs for New Zealand, and will be particularly tough for those with the least resources, including Māori and Pacific populations and low-income New Zealanders. The New Zealand Government response has included a range of measures to protect these groups, including a major economic support package and restrictions on rent increases and evictions.But New Zealand still has to plan for the real, but hopefully small, chance of its elimination strategy failing. Then it will need to switch to a suppression or mitigation approach. With these other strategies there is also the potential to dramatically reduce the death toll by adopting targeted measures to protect vulnerable populations from infection (particularly older people and those with chronic conditions). Continuing to upgrade the health system to better manage surges of patients with Covid-19 is also critical.The elimination strategy offers two major advantages over alternative approaches of mitigation or suppression. There should be fewer cases of illness and death if started early, and it offers a clear and more rapid exit path if successful. As with all future scenarios, optimism must be balanced with caution and the world will almost certainly need new tools such as vaccines and antivirals to more fully manage the Covid-19 threat.If John Snow was looking down on the world of 2020 he would be unimpressed. It seems frustratingly true that we are poor at learning the lessons of history with pandemics, as with other threats to global health. One key lesson is that more investment in public health infrastructure is critically needed in all countries to better manage pandemics and a range of less severe health threats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f03da2c34da2dfc9dcf49a3dd210d462a45225b/0_140_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc4c0dc2889b0a62c50053ee1e301a92","title":"leap of faith ancient britons viewed hares chickens as gods easter","story":"Iron age research reveals modern Easter festivals not first to celebrate chicks and bunniesBrown hares and chickens were revered as gods rather than reared for food when they were first introduced to Britain in the iron age, archaeological analysis suggests.In research that shows modern-day Easter festivals were not the first to celebrate chicks and bunnies, a team of experts from the universities of Exeter, Leicester and Oxford have found evidence that the animals were buried with care and intact in the period that preceded the Roman invasion of Britain.Historical evidence suggests Britons of the period associated the animals with deities and considered them too special to eat. Commentarii de Bello Gallico, Julius Caesar’s firsthand account of the Gallic wars, says “the Britons consider it contrary to ine law to eat the hare, the chicken or the goose. They raise these, however, for their own amusement or pleasure.”Radiocarbon analysis of hare and chicken skeletons from a number of sites in Hampshire and Herefordshire backs up that assertion, showing that the two species were introduced simultaneously to Britain between the fifth and third centuries BC. Excavation has previously revealed the animals had been carefully buried without being butchered.Prof Naomi Sykes from the University of Exeter, who is leading the research, said: ““Easter is an important British festival, yet none of its iconic elements are native to Britain. The idea that chickens and hares initially had religious associations is not surprising as cross-cultural studies have shown that exotic things and animals are often given supernatural status.“Historical accounts have suggested chickens and hares were too special to be eaten and were instead associated with deities – chickens with an iron age god akin to Roman Mercury, and hares with an unknown female hare goddess. The religious association of hares and chickens endured throughout the Roman period.“However, archaeological evidence shows that as their populations increased, they were increasingly eaten, and hares were even farmed as livestock. Rather than being buried as iniduals, hare and chicken remains were then disposed of as food waste.”The cross-disciplinary academic team, whose objective is to investigate the origins of Easter traditions and the animals that have come to be associated with it, has previously revealed that the first rabbits were introduced to Britain not by the Normans, as was previously thought, but by the Romans, who arrived in the first century AD.Hares and chickens were both farmed for food during the Roman occupation of Britain, but in the economic collapse following the Roman withdrawal in 410AD rabbits became locally extinct and the populations of chickens and brown hares crashed.Historical and archaeological evidence show rabbits were reintroduced to Britain as an elite food by the Normans in the 11th century. Rabbits were increasingly common in the 19th century, probably contributing to their replacement of the hare as the Easter bunny when the festival’s traditions were reinvigorated by the Victorians."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3640c2cb134a1236e456d2136a5a5d0d0621148e/0_240_6454_3873/master/6454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acb89a2f7e1d245d6387b18cdca32183","title":"tech giants struggle stem infodemic false coronavirus claims","story":"Critics say efforts are too little, too late as research reveals vast majority of false claims appear onlineClick over to Google, type in “coronavirus”, and press enter.The results you see will bear little resemblance to any other search.There are no ads, no product recommendations, and no links to websites that have figured out how to win the search engine optimisation game. Government, NGO and mainstream media sources dominate.Algorithms and user-generated content are out gatekeepers and fact checking are in.Silicon Valley has responded to the “infodemic” with aggressive intervention and an embrace of official sources and traditional media outlets.Across the social web – on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram and Pinterest – search results related to Covid-19 are similarly predetermined.Instagram delivers a pop-up urging US users to go to the website for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – or UK users to the NHS – rather than look at the memes and pictures tagged with #coronavirus.On Facebook, a dedicated “Information Center” includes a mix of curated information and official medical advice. On Pinterest, the only infographics and memes to be found on topics such as “Covid-19” or “hydroxychloroquine” are those made by internationally recognised health organisations, such as the WHO.It is a stark contrast to how social media platforms have dealt with misinformation in the past.US-based platforms, shaped by Silicon Valley’s libertarian ethos and protected by the first amendment, have long been reluctant to take a proactive editorial role or censor speech that could be considered political.They have had to be pushed, prodded, cajoled, protested, and shamed into addressing hate speech, anti-vaxx propaganda and the harassment of victims of mass shootings.On coronavirus, they have competed to be responsible and reliable sources of information. Yet still misinformation continues to adapt and spread, largely on social media.A conspiracy theory falsely linking 5G to the coronavirus pandemic has led to real-world consequences, including threats and harassment against telecom engineers and petrol bomb attacks on telephone poles.Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington professor of biology who also studies and has written a book about misinformation, says the efforts of the social media companies are too little, too late.“They’ve built this whole ecosystem that is all about engagement, allows viral spread, and hasn’t ever put any currency on accuracy,” he said. “Now all of a sudden we have a serious global crisis, and they want to put some Band-Aids on it. It’s better than not acting, but praising them for doing it is like praising Philip Morris for putting filters on cigarettes.”Some of the more radical steps taken by tech companies include Twitter’s new policy to remove misinformation that contradicts official public health advice, such as tweets encouraging people not to follow physical distancing guidelines, and WhatsApp’s strict new limits on message forwarding.The platforms feel they can be much more aggressive on coronavirus misinformation than they have been on political misinformation, said Claire Wardle of the non-profit organisation First Draft.“There are no two sides with coronavirus, so they don’t have people on the other side saying: ‘We want this,’ the way you do with anti-vaxxers or political misinformation,” said Wardle. “They are freer to act.”It is also relatively simple and straightforward for the platforms to select trusted sources of authoritative information – the WHO, NHS, CDC, etc – without appearing politically biased.Wardle faulted the tech companies for not being better prepared for the crisis, however. Facebook has long ignored the conspiracy communities that organise using Facebook groups, such as anti-vaxxers, followers of QAnon, and people who believe 5G is harmful. Coronavirus misinformation is rampant in those communities.And while the scientific nature of the crisis may lessen some of the external political pressures over how to moderate speech, it also brings with it a slew of challenges. The coronavirus is brand new, and the scientific understanding of it changes daily.Bergstrom described this conundrum as an “uncertainty vacuum”. “Any reasonable authority will not give you a straight answer” to certain questions about the pandemic, “not because they’re trying to mislead you, but because they don’t know yet,” he said. Another complicating factor is that normally trustworthy sources are not providing reliable information.“We’ve seen the US government, particularly the White House, becoming a significant purveyor of misinformation around the virus,” Bergstrom said.Facebook and Twitter have removed posts by prominent and powerful people over coronavirus misinformation, including the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, but the real test of their resolve will be whether they ever take action against misinformation by Trump.“We planned for years for this pandemic, but we never realised that we would be fighting a war on two fronts,” said Bergstrom. “One against the pandemic, and one against all the disinformation and hate and fear that is being amped up and enflamed by political opportunists.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2661c89e7aa5ec016157d330a1628a3f2184abea/0_374_6048_3627/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd42984b448f84f5858cddca974999f","title":"wuhan ends coronavirus lockdown in pictures","story":"After 76 days sealed off from the world, the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus pandemic began, has opened its doors again.

All around us were jagged, brilliant white peaks, piercing blue glaciers and water flecked with such a constellation of ice fragments that you could imagine a sky-sized mirror had shattered on to the surface of the ocean.The pilot cut the outboard engine to reduce noise while the scientist, Tim Lewis, dropped the hydrophone – essentially a waterproof microphone on a long cable – into the ocean. We sat quietly as the boat bobbed and drifted to within a few metres of an iceberg the size of a church. Dozens of gentoo penguins swished in and out of the water. Further off, we could hear the intermittent rumbles of avalanches as mountain snow warmed and collapsed in the pale southern summer sun. But it was the underwater soundscape that we had come to hear. After playing out 20 metres of cable, Lewis took off his woolly hat, put on the headphones, closed his eyes and let his ears take him down to the depths. We watched his face for clues as to what he was hearing. First a frown. (Is the equipment working properly?) Then a look of bemusement. Finally a wry smile. “I have never heard anything like it. Not what I expected at all,” he said. “It sounds like dripping, like the inside of a gorge.”The earphones were passed from person to person. Everyone listened with a similar expression of concentration and offered their own interpretation of these strange sounds. “Drips in a drain,” said one of the activists. “Forest waterfall,” said the coxswain. “Rainfall on city streets,” said the camera operator.My turn came, and I, too, was transported. Not, it seemed, below the ocean, but into a vast cavern, where it sounded as if water was cascading from a high ceiling, each drip echoing through the emptiness.  Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:uploads.guim20200408melting-glacier--trimmed.mp3 “That’s the sound of the iceberg melting,” Lewis informed us. When snow falls, he explained, pockets of air get trapped and then compressed inside glaciers over years, centuries, even millennia. “What you can hear are the pops as they are released,” he said. It was the opposite of what we imagined. Rather than water dripping down through air, we were listening to air escaping up through water. We were so close to the ice that this ancient fizz was surprisingly loud. Though we humans never hear it above the surface, this is the sound the Antarctic makes every summer. And as the planet heats, the sound is getting louder.It was mid-January, the peak of the Antarctic summer, and I had joined a broader 10-month, pole-to-pole expedition by scientists and campaigners on two Greenpeace ships, the Arctic Sunrise and the Esperanza. On this final leg around the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands, nine researchers from British, French and US universities were measuring how human activity is disturbing the region’s natural equilibrium.With the help of 59 crew members – a mix of sailors, engineers and activists – the scientists conducted acoustic monitoring, environmental DNA sampling, testing for plastic microfibres, phytoplankton analysis, as well as surveys of penguin and whale populations. Just as the first explorers once charted coastlines voyage by voyage, the aim was to map Antarctic ecosystems. Many of the waters and islands we were visiting had not been surveyed for decades, if ever. I caught up with the Sunrise at King George’s Island, about 600 miles south of Cape Horn, the southern tip of South America. Home to an airfield, two churches, the research bases of 10 countries and about 500 semi-permanent residents, this international community has often been cast as the last hope of humanity in dystopian novels and films because of its remoteness, collaborative spirit and focus on science. (Today, coincidentally, Antarctica is the only continent that does not have a single case of coronavirus).But it is all too vulnerable to the other great global crisis – climate change. Veterans of Antarctic exploration had warned me that this location would give me my first taste of how rapidly the region is warming. On the slopes around the bay, there was more bare rock than snow, while the stony beach was so free of ice that it could almost have been Brighton, were it not for the penguins. This was to be expected. Temperatures on the peninsula – the finger of land that points up from Antarctica towards South America – have risen by about 3C in the past 70 years, one of the fastest increases in the world. What was more surprising was the number of other vessels bobbing in the bay.“People think Antarctica is isolated. That is a myth,” Marcelo Leppe, the director of Chile’s National Antarctic Institute, had told me when I visited him the previous day in Punta Arenas, the capital of Chile’s southernmost region. “The changes are so great it is hard to put them in words,” he said. Since Leppe started studying the region in 2002, he had seen more and more visitors, and less and less snow. “I have seen glaciers retreat by 100 metres, and parts of the land become so green that it almost looks like a golf course,” he said. In December, monitoring equipment at the Chilean research base on King George Island detected something that worried Leppe even more: black carbon in the air, which came from the Australian bushfires more than 6,200 miles away. Even in tiny quantities, this soot darkens the white landscape, reducing its capacity to reflect sunlight and making it melt faster. “At least future geologists will find this black layer helpful to identify the year 2020 in their ice cores,” he joked darkly.There will be other clues for the geologists of the future. On 24 December 2019, the Antarctic probably suffered its worst one-day ice melt since records began, according to analysis by the University of Liège. In February, a mainland record of 18.3C was registered at the Argentinian base on the tip of the peninsula. Days later, a continental high of 20.75C was measured at a monitoring station on Seymour Island. On that day, on that island, the Antarctic was hotter than Cape Town.For the first two days, we sailed south in serene conditions, gazing in wonder at the seascape and wildlife. You can glimpse more species in the average London garden than on this immense continent, which covers an area the size of the US and Mexico combined. But what its residents lack in variety, they make up for in numbers.That was clear from our first short excursion at Trinity Island, which lies 150 miles southwest of King George Island. There we came across a vast number of chattering penguins, grunting seals and squawking cormorants – along with a startling number of tourists. There, and at our next stop in Paradise Harbour, we saw six giant cruise liners in the space of four days, disgorging groups of whale watchers on dinghies, adventure holidaymakers on kayaks, and red-jacketed trekkers wandering through guano-stained slopes. This southern hemisphere summer – which was the 200th anniversary of the first sighting of the Antarctic – a record 80,000 tourists were expected in the continent, an almost threefold increase from 2015. Before the coronavirus pandemic, shipbuilders had been seeing strong demand for polar- and ice-class cruise liners. Luxury cruise operators have tried to outdo one another with heated deck “igloos”, underwater lounges and extendable viewing platforms. Tourists pay as much as $10,000 (£8,500) or even $20,000 to experience what brochures describe as “the Earth’s last great wilderness frontier”. For our hyper-dominant species, part of the attraction of Antarctica is the chance to feel small in the presence of the sublime, to return to a time when nature seemed like an awe-inspiring and nurturing mother rather than the frail and overburdened grandparent it increasingly resembles today. To ensure that tourists feel like they are journeying through a nearly deserted wilderness, tour operators coordinate schedules and instruct captains to use radar to avoid visual sightings of other vessels. (As our polar guide, Tom Foreman, noted, the impression of solitude would be “somewhat ruined if you see 500 people floating past on another big lump of steel”.) If there is something absurd about tour companies expending so much energy on crafting the illusion of solitude, it does at least help avoid overcrowding. Biosecurity is no small matter in the Antarctic. Boots need to be sterilised before setting foot on land to avoid spreading seeds, fungi or viruses. Everyone must keep their distance from wildlife – five metres from a penguin, 10 metres from a seal, 50 metres from a whale, unless they come to you. And no littering. Over the past five years, Astrid Zafiro has watched the traffic to Antarctica grow. As chief of Argentina’s Admiral Brown base in Paradise Harbour, about 250 miles south-west of King George Island, she considers the rise in tourism as visible as the changes wrought by a warming climate. After guiding us through a penguin colony and up a slope behind the small research facility, Zafiro pointed across the bay at a newly emerged nunatak – a bare mountain peak sticking out above the ice. Near the nunatak, a massive cruise liner was unloading Chinese tourists in rubber boats. In the distance, we heard a crash as another slab of fractured glacier crashed into the water. “It is all happening right in front of us – the bay full of tourists, the ice breaking,” Zafiro said wistfully. Zafiro described a feedback loop that does not appear in climate models: the more the Antarctic is threatened by the climate crisis, the more tourists want to visit before it melts away. That means more cruise (and air) miles to the end of the Earth, more carbon dioxide and more global heating. Last-chance-to-see tourism becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. On board the Sunrise, a young German member of the ship’s crew, Carola Rackete, told me about “solastalgia”, the term coined by the philosopher Glenn Albrecht to describe the pre-emptive sense of loss that people feel when witnessing natural beauty in this era of environmental destruction. “You enjoy it knowing that next time it will be changed beyond recognition. There is always the anticipation of loss, which makes me feels sad,” Rackete said. Solastalgia is hard to escape in the Antarctic.We passed three days in Paradise Harbour, going out daily in the boats to gather samples and look and listen for whales, seals and penguins. On our final night, I was reluctant to sleep, knowing this was the last chance to take it all in. As the sun’s pale afterglow faded behind the mountains, the dusky bay was as smooth as polished chrome. Time itself seemed to have frozen and I began to understand why so many of the early Antarctic explorers felt close to God here. After a few moments, my transcendental musings were interrupted by the sound of KC and the Sunshine Band echoing out from a huge cruise liner anchored 100 or so metres away. “That’s the way, uh-huh uh-huh, I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh” continued to ring in my ears as I made my way to the cabin.There are still some Antarctic islands that have rarely, if ever, been visited by humans. They are deemed too small, too plain, too remote or too storm-battered. Our destination the following day, Low, seemed to tick all of these boxes. This south-westernmost island in the South Shetlands, nine miles long by five miles wide, takes the full brunt of the winds and waves that spin around the Shrieking Sixties, the stretch of latitude between 60 and 70 degrees south, which is notorious for howling gales.

Penguin guano is the only excrement that can be seen from space. Over generations, the projectile poo from tens of thousands of krill-eating birds dyes rock a delicate pink. This makes colony spotting easy, but for more precise calculations, the team of four scientists use drones and artificial intelligence to count nests. Then, armed with handheld clickers, they head out to sample areas to double-check their findings. Each cluster is counted three times in a row to ensure wandering penguins do not evade the census. One member of the team, Noah Strycker, described the process to me as “a Zen-like activity”.Chinstraps have a reputation for being one of the noisiest and most aggressive of the penguin species. During courtship, the birds chat up potential mates with loud displays. After separating to gather food, they reunite with ecstatic greetings. If nests are threatened by predators, parents shriek protectively. Scientists have discovered that birds can filter out the background cacophony and focus in on the call of their own family members (the so-called “cocktail party effect”). But this skill becomes less essential as the chinstrap population diminishes, and the boisterous hubbub of the colony grows quieter. As we wandered from nest from nest to nest, totting up chicks, the loudest noise was from pubescent chicks nagging their parents for more regurgitated krill, the tiny shrimplike creature that constitutes the chinstrap’s only meal. Scientists believe this dependence on a single food source is one reason why chinstraps populations are plummeting. Krill graze on organisms that grow under the sea ice, so when the ice melts, the krill disappear in turn. By contrast, another species of penguin, the gentoo, is thriving, because it is far less fussy about its diet. The population final count is not yet complete, but it is already clear that the chinstraps on Low are just as vulnerable as elsewhere. And it is not only the penguins that are in danger. “Such a big decline over a short time suggests something is broken in the Southern Ocean ecosystem,” said Strycker.It was a sobering thought to sleep on Low amid that shifting climate. Our group may well have been the first in history to camp on the island. The polar guides had to tie the tents to boulders because there was no soil to bang pegs into. The tents withstood a cold night of wind and rain, but there was nothing anyone could do about the smell and the chatter. In the damp darkness, the penguins hunkered down, although they never fell completely silent. Thirty years ago, the noise would have been louder. The quietening of Low was far less soothing than it sounded.Over the next two days, the weather took a turn for the worse. With a storm brewing out at sea, we sheltered in Discovery Bay, an indent on the northern coast of Greenwich Island, waiting for a break in the clouds that refused to come. In the sea, the only signs of life were strings of salps – tiny tubes of transparent jelly with pink dots for bellies. As waters warm, these little zooplankton are thriving at the expense of krill, which is bad news for the ocean ecosystem and the climate because they are a lot less nutritious for predators, and they do not appear to play such a major role in helping the ocean absorb carbon dioxide. (Krill are better at this because they graze more on phytoplankton – tiny, plantlike organisms that absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.) The change is another consequence of the ominous sound we had heard on the hydrophone several days earlier. As the Antarctic melt gets louder, there will be fewer chinstraps and krill, more gentoos and salps, less oxygen, more acid, and, of course, less land ice and more sea water.An increasing number of scientists believe the melting of West Antarctica is so far beyond natural fluctuations that it has become irreversible. In February, a first examination of the underside of the vast Thwaites glacier – which covers an area similar to that of the UK – showed extensive erosion by warm water. This and the nearby Pine Island glacier are now losing ice five times faster than in the 90s. A collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet is now a serious concern. It might be tempting to think humanity can do nothing right, but the short history of human interaction with the Antarctic suggests we can at least learn from our mistakes and reverse some of the damage we have caused.The stratosphere high above our heads is proof of that. In the 1980s, the world was horrified to discover that certain chemicals had thinned the ozone layer and opened up a vast hole above the Antarctic that was raising cancer risks and disrupting weather systems and ocean currents. Since then, however, international efforts to reduce CFCs and other ozone-depleting chemicals have eased that threat. This year, scientists were relieved to find that disruption of southern wind systems has paused and may even be returning towards its natural state. There is a risk that a closed ozone hole will trap more heat, but the initial damage is on its way to being repaired. This is also true of wildlife in the region. For 4.5bn years, not a single whisper was carried on the winds or the waves of this region. It was only 200 years ago, years after the invention of the steam engine and electric lighting, that humans first caught sight of Antarctica. The explorers who first mapped the continent were lauded as heroes, but carnage often followed in their wake. James Clark Ross – the British naval officer who discovered the sea now named after him – knew exactly what would happen to the seals and penguins he saw on his voyage. “Hitherto beyond the reach of their persecutors, they have enjoyed a life of tranquillity and security, but will now, no doubt, be made to contribute to the wealth of our country,” he wrote in his diary in 1841.Like seals and penguins before them, whales appeared to be doomed. But unfashionable regulations and often unpopular campaigning have made a difference. Steady increases since the moratorium on commercial whaling that came into effect in 1985 have taken southern hemisphere humpbacks close to their pre-exploitation population of about 80,000, according to the International Whaling Commission. The scientists on the Greenpeace ships are helping to track whale populations by collecting vast amounts of acoustic data, such as the communal chatter of a pod of orcas and the thunderous clicks of the sperm whale, the loudest natural sound made by any creature on Earth. Thrillingly, blue whales are also making a comeback. Last month, a British Antarctic Survey mission to South Georgia recorded 55 in just three weeks. For campaigners, the recovery of whales is a much-needed reminder that international cooperation can be effective, protections can work, and our species is capable of undoing the damage we inflicted on the natural world. But nobody is complacent. The actor Gustaf Skarsgård, who had joined the trip in order to promote conservation to his social media followers, summed it up with a personal comparison. “It’s like Antarctica is in recovery. I know a thing or two about that,” he said. “A low point has passed but the condition is still fragile. It needs more time or it could slip back again.” After the storm finally abated, the Sunrise sailed back to King George Island, from where I would have to take a plane home. The closer we came to the airport, the more cruise ships and scientific vessels we saw. In the 10 days since we had left, summer had taken a visible toll. Hillsides that had been covered in snow were now bare, black rock. The naked Antarctic will never be a tourist draw, but it is a powerful reminder that underneath the Earth’s fragile outer layer of water, ice, earth and vegetation, this is just another rock hurtling through space.Of all the moments during the trip, one stands out – an encounter in Paradise Harbour that stirred two rare feelings in the age of the Anthropocene: pure unmitigated joy and a nascent sense of hope.I heard the humpback before I saw it. A ripple, a sigh, then a soft splash behind my back. I turned in time to see the dorsal fin arc languorously out and back into the water just like a fairytale sketch of a sea serpent. The whale was about 30 metres away, and coming towards us. We couldn’t move – the coxswain had cut the boat’s engine a few minutes earlier in preparation for a hydrophone recording. All we could do was look on, speechless, as the whale drew nearer, 15 metres now, snorting water once again from its blowhole, then slipping just far enough below the surface to be out of sight. It was thrilling. Did the whale realise there was an obstacle in its path? Our small boat would surely be upturned in a collision with a creature that size. The whale had something else in mind. After passing just below the surface a few metres from the front of our craft, it turned parallel and so close we could almost reach out and touch it. Then the whale tilted its giant head out of the water and yawned cavernously, revealing a bed-sized tongue and the bristled carpet of its baleen plates. Seconds later, with a flick of its knobbled pectoral fin, it was under the water again. Mouths agape, beaming rapturously, the five of us looked at each other to confirm we had not imagined what we had seen. I cannot remember sharing such joy. The experience felt almost holy. But it wasn’t over. We turned around, and there was the whale again, completing a full circle of the boat, before silently swimming back the way it had come.We returned to the ship on a high. We were too excited to capture the encounter with any great skill. Nobody had pushed the record switch on the hydrophone. The clip I filmed on my phone was partly obscured by other bodies. Never mind. The moment would linger long in the memory. By listening, we had seen so much.Jonathan Watts’s time on board the Arctic Sunrise was funded by Greenpeace"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Marlet The derelict Techrete factory site near the seaside village’s Dart station was the subject of a number of previous plans for residential development in the last five years.The previous schemes were for less than half the number of homes for which developer Pat Crean now has permission. Locals had warned a previous application for 200 homes would cause severe traffic congestion on the main road to the village and would amount to over-development of the site.Accessible walkwayThe new complex of 512 mostly one- and two-bed apartments between the Howth Road and Claremont beach to the west of the harbour, will be built in blocks up to eight storeys tall with 439 parking spaces and 1,335 bike spaces.The plans from Atlas GP Ltd, a subsidiary of Mr Crean’s development company Marlet, also include a publicly accessible walkway and cycleway, a civic plaza, a landscaped park and communal gardens. Shops, a restaurant, and a cafe at ground-floor level also feature.The number of apartments exceeds the total number of homes Fingal County Council had designated for Howth in its 2017-2023 County Development Plan, which saw the village as having the capacity to accommodate 498 homes over a five-year period.However, in its decision the board said the development was “justified” in line with a number of Government policies, including the policy to “ramp up delivery of housing”.The scheme would “respect and enhance the historic and architectural character of the area”, the board said and its height and quantum of development were “acceptable”. It would also support the “commercial role of Howth’s town centre and would be acceptable in terms of pedestrian and traffic safety and convenience”.Mr Crean was last month granted permission for the redevelopment of another Howth site, the former Baily Court Hotel at the other end of the village. The approval by the board of his plans for 177 apartments came less than two months after the High Court quashed permission for a smaller scheme at the site.Locals in Howth opposed the construction of the 177 apartments in three blocks up to five storeys high, as well as the earlier development of 164 apartments, on a site overlooking Howth harbour and close to the village Martello tower.PermissionIn February, Mr Crean was granted permission for 650 apartments beside St Anne’s Park in Raheny.

This decision was the subject of a High Court challenge by a local resident, with Labour TD Aodhán Ó Ríordáin and former senator Averil Power, listed as notice parties.The challenge failed due to the complaint not being made within the time limits for objections to planning decisions.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4225539.1586474659!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus government to extend restrictions for at least two weeks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFr Malachy Conlon brings the Blessed Sacrament to parishioners in Co Louth while churches close and services are cancelled. Photograph: Peter LarkinCiara WilkinsonThe Government will on Friday announce an extension of the Covid-19 restrictions on commercial and social life, but is expected to indicate that a partial lifting of the strict regime could take place next month if the rate of infections continues to fall.The restrictions are to stay in place for at least the next two weeks, with several senior sources expecting that they will remain until the May bank holiday weekend.The move is likely to be announced on Friday afternoon after a meeting of senior public health officials. Minister for Health Simon Harris is then expected to sign an extension of the Garda powers to enforce the lockdown.While the focus remains on maintaining the restrictions of recent weeks in order to continue the suppression of the virus, senior officials have begun to work on plans for a “phased” exit from the lockdown.However, senior sources stress that even when the easing of the restrictions comes, it will only be partial and gradual.Priorities are expected to include reopening some retail businesses, construction and schools – possibly for only part of the week initially.There was a heavy Garda presence on many routes on Thursday as gardaí sought to enforce restrictions. As the Easter holiday approaches, cross-Border travel will be monitored by gardaí and PSNI officers to ensure people are adhering to coronavirus restrictions.People caught by gardaí engaging in unnecessary travel this weekend will be given at least three opportunities to comply with the law before facing arrest, according to a direction from Garda management.Before resorting to arrest, gardaí must go through the four-step escalation process termed “engage, explain, encourage, enforce”, Garda superintendents have been advised.Under the emergency legislation anyone travelling for non-essential reasons or exercising farther than 2km from home will be committing an offence.Phased wayAssistant secretary general at the Department of Taoiseach Liz Canavan said on Thursday that work was under way to determine what any lifting of restrictions would look like.“I suppose at the beginning we might have all thought that would happen in one go, but we’re more clear now it’s going to happen in a much more phased way. So there’s ongoing work, and there are a number of subgroups looking at a range of issues,” she said.However, Ministers and senior officials were at pains to stress that any relaxation of the restrictions was weeks away and entirely contingent on uncertain factors – not just further reductions in the infection rate but a significant increase in testing and tracing capacityIt was announced on Thursday evening that 28 more people had died from the coronavirus, bringing the total number of fatalities in the State to 263.Fifteen of the patients who died were female, and 13 were male, with a median age of 84, according to the National Public Health Emergency Team. Nineteen of the patients had an underlying health condition. Some 22 of the deaths were located in the east, two in the northwest, two in the south and two in the west.The number of confirmed cases in the State increased by 500, the highest increase in a single day to date and now stands at 6,574.Analysis by the Health Surveillance Protection Centre (HSPC) of 6,444 cases as of Tuesday shows the median age of known cases is 48.Although the number of known cases rose sharply on Thursday, data compiled for the Department of Health shows the rate of growth is beginning to slow. While new cases were growing at a rate of 33 per cent at the beginning of the outbreak, that has slowed to 9 per cent this week.In addition, there has been a significant decline in the infection rate – the number of infections caused by people infected with the virus.At the beginning of the outbreak each case was responsible for 4.5 infections this had now been reduced to about one person, said Prof Philip Nolan, chairman of the National Public Health Emergency Team’s epidemiological modelling group.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said he was “sensitive” to uncertainty facing Leaving Cert students regarding the State examinations, and officials “will try to bring as much certainty to that as quickly as we can”.Dr Holohan added that travel into the country from the UK and further abroad was “very very limited” to returning Irish citizens and essential workers, such as haulage drivers working in key supply chains.MasksThe HSE’s chief clinical officer, Dr Colm Henry, said the health service’s position on the use of face masks had not changed, and only iniduals advised to wear masks should use the protective equipment.Latest HSPC figures show that two more people between ages of 35 and 54 died earlier this week, bringing the death toll of coronavirus victims under 55 years of age to 12.Among the confirmed daily deaths announced on Monday, April 6th, was a person aged between 35 and 44 and a person aged between 45 and 54.Out of the total deaths of 223 reported on Monday, 200 people were aged 65 years and over 11 were aged between 55 and 64 seven were aged between 45 and 54 three were aged between 35 and 44 and two were aged between 25 and 34.Out of 5,981 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases, the 223 deaths gave a fatality rate of 3.7 per cent.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd.

This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4225434.1586459857!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"worse than any horror film inside a los zetas cartel kitchen","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStudents and parents of the 43 missing students of Ayotzinapa demand justice in Mexico City after their  forced disappearances. Photograph: Cristian LeyvaBloody handprints on walls, stained clothes, plastic cable ties, machetes and, as one person observes, the crunch of bones beneath a thick blanket of ash. Amid sobbing, families of some of Mexico’s estimated 60,000 disappeared absorb the scene at La Gallera ranch in northern Veracruz.A few metres from an abandoned single-storey house, an outdoor brick oven was once used to make the traditional corn dish zacahuil. After the Los Zetas cartel took over the ranch in 2011, however, it was used to incinerate its victims. In this part of Mexico, someone explains, brutality has stained language: “to zacahuil” can now mean to cook humans.In one of 12 “kitchens” recently discovered by families in northern Veracruz, volunteers and forensic examiners in white protective suits and face masks use sieves to search for fragments of human bones, teeth and nails in mounds of compacted grey ash.Los Zetas, originally founded by Mexican special forces deserters, some with US training, started as the enforcement arm of the Gulf Cartel, a crime group from northeastern Mexico, before breaking away. While Los Zetas has itself fragmented, it was known for torture, beheadings and massacres of civilians.More than 250,000 people have been killed since former president Felipe Calderon launched the so-called “drug war” in 2006, a conflict of shifting alliances and ever-increasing numbers of armed groups, dogged by persistent allegations that elements of the Mexican state are deeply intertwined with organised crime.Mexican government figures indicate that at least 60,000 people have been “disappeared” since 2006. Yet a\u0026nbsp2015 report by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights found only six federal court convictions for the crime of forced disappearance.Disappearances have been carried out by state forces, crime groups, or both together, with motives including kidnapping people for sex slavery, organ harvesting, forced labour, ransoms, repression of political activists and journalists, and gender-based violence.Indicative of the state’s inability or unwillingness to take action, this most recent search at La Gallera was initiated by the Fifth National Search Brigade for the Disappeared, a grassroots initiative of families and volunteers.Escorted by heavily armed federal troops, the brigade spent two weeks in February searching northern Veracruz for hidden and mass graves, as well as the “living disappeared” in prisons, hospitals and in the streets.Unclaimed bodiesGroups also collected DNA samples from the public to form a database and attended mortuaries, where consistent administrative errors were discovered, stoking fears of a “double disappearance” of unclaimed bodies.Such state negligence led the search brigade to demand an “extraordinary mechanism” for northern Veracruz, a call made in the presence of representatives of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Mexico.Standing on the terrace of the house, “Ángeles”, who is searching for her son, Ángel, speaks through tears: “I have no doubt that those bones are from human beings. Maybe they’re from my son, or the children of my comrades, and we’ll never find them.”Her son was kidnapped along with two friends in March 2016 in the city of Poza Rica, which borders the municipality of Tiahuatlán, the site of La Gallera. Ángeles believes her son was kidnapped by Veracruz state police officers and subsequently disappeared. She explains she has received no word from authorities about the investigation.To the anger and frustration of families, the “kitchen” at La Gallera is not a new discovery: families compelled authorities to search the site on four occasions since 2017, with each subsequent search yielding new discoveries previously missed by authorities.Separate searches found six beheaded bodies children’s skulls femur, pelvic and jaw bones and hundreds of bone fragments, some burned.Allegations of state negligence, or collusion, are strengthened by documents seen by The .Corrupt police“Karim”, an ex-police officer and the then Los Zetas “boss” of northern Veracruz, gave a signed statement to federal prosecutors on August 31st, 2011, following his arrest by Mexican marines. He detailed two other kitchens used to “cook people”, giving GPS co-ordinates and Google street view photos. Both “kitchens” are located near Poza Rica, close to the killing ground at La Gallera.Alongside a handwritten chart showing the 2011 hierarchy of Los Zetas, where he places himself third, Karim mentioned the 386,000 pesos (approximately €19,000) he paid each month to corrupt police officers in northern Veracruz the same area where La Gallera sits, and where Ángeles believes her son was kidnapped and disappeared by state police officers.Despite the federal government knowing of the existence of the “kitchens” in the area since 2011, it appears no action was taken. The one at La Gallera is thought to have started operating that same year, possibly until the final months of 2016, shortly before authorities conducted their first search after pressure from families.For Alejandro Salas Álvarez, a solidarity volunteer with the search brigade, the scene at La Gallera was “the worst thing I have ever seen. Worse than any horror film.”He stresses, however, that La Gallera is not unique: “Practically the whole country is a mass grave”, he says, adding: “The whole world needs to know that people were dissolved in acid in Mexico, because the government allowed it to happen.”“One day there will be monuments throughout the country, like in Germany. Plaques with faces, names and stories of the disappeared, as a reminder of what happened in these places, and as a way to say ‘never again’,” Álvarez says.Dissolved in acidMario Vergara takes a break from searching undergrowth. He is looking for his brother Tomás, who was kidnapped on July 5th, 2012, in Huitzuco, Guerrero, close to the site of kidnapping of the 43 Ayotzinapa students.He explains that searches for the disappeared are thwarted by extermination methods which can leave no traces of victims, such as dissolving bodies in acid or burning them with diesel or petrol, or other manners of physically erasing humans.“We once went to an area where they were feeding them to crocodiles. Of course there wasn’t a trace,” Vergara says, “So how are we going to make the government understand that people did disappear when there’s nothing left?”While the vast majority of the 60,000 disappearances occurred before the presidency of Andrés Manuel López Obrador started in December 2018, there is frustration that not enough is being done by the current government.While a national search commission was set up under the 2017 General Law of Disappearances to help search for the disappeared, Vergara sees it as an “affection” or “symbolic”.“It’s shameful for the Mexican state that it’s the families who are teaching the ‘experts’ how to search,” Vergara says. “The families are in the hills and fields, while the government is sitting here on the outside.”In stark contrast to the trauma of La Gallera, however, the searches also displayed the best of humanity: the quiet dignity of families searching for loved ones, and growth of solidarity, community and sense of an extended family.For Vergara, the trauma of experiencing places like La Gallera must find its counterweight in love and hope.“After such horrific days – of ovens, of kitchens, of testimonies – we have to get rid of all this, so it doesn’t damage us,” he says. “And the only way for me to do that is to go home and hug my little girl.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Politics latest news:  Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick admits travelling 150 miles from London to second home German region to reopen schools as opposition to lockdown mountsCoronavirus latest news: Boris is \u0026#39not out of the woods\u0026#39 and \u0026#39almost took one for the team\u0026#39, says father StanleyWhat are ventilators - and how can they help tackle the coronavirus outbreak?

However, the ban on slaughtering and selling live animals remains in place.Scientists and Chinese officials believe the deadly virus  jumped to humans from wild animals, via creatures such as bats.Close contact with wild animals at the markets, which had been closed since January, has been widely blamed for the outbreak.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus entered new york europe not asia researchers find","story":"One study has found an early case of the virus in the city was in all likelihood indirectly transmitted by an inidual who brought it across from Britain.But while President Donald Trump barred foreign nations at the end of January from entering the US if they had been in China, it was not until mid-March that similar restrictions were placed on travellers from most European countries.Researchers suggest that by this point travellers had already been returning to New York with coronavirus from countries such as Italy.They found that the Long Island patient’s viral genome correlated with that of a strain circulating in Britain. That suggested the patient had contact with someone who had brought the virus over from the UK.Scientists at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital have written a study also indicating that coronavirus began to circulate in the New York area by mid-February, weeks before the first confirmed case, and that the travelers who brought in the virus did not arrive from Asia.Harm van Bakel, a geneticist at Icahn who co-wrote the study, which is awaiting peer review, told The New York Times: “The majority is clearly European.” Both teams examined genomes from coronaviruses taken from New Yorkers from mid-March.Their research appears to suggest that the previously hidden spread of the virus might have been detected earlier if more testing had been in place.China announced at the end of December that doctors in Wuhan were treating dozens of cases of a new respiratory illness.A few countries, such as Singapore, launched an aggressive testing program to identify the arrival of the virus and trace its spread through the population.But the US initially limited testing only to people who had come from China in the two weeks before January 31 and displayed symptoms of Covid-19.Dr Heguy said: “It was a disaster that we didn’t do testing. People were just oblivious.”One passenger, Pam Mundus, who returned home on a direct flight from Rome to JFK on March 1, said at the time that no one questioned her about her visit to Italy, or whether she might have been exposed to the virus. Early findings suggest that the virus was in New York well before a woman in her 30s from Manhattan became the city’s first official patient on March 1.Dr Viviana Simon, of the team, said in a statement that the results indicate that the coronavirus “came to New York City and environs predominantly via untracked transmission between the United States and Europe, with only limited introduction from China, where the virus originated.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus next 100 days future uk economy health","story":"On new year\u0027s eve last year the first case of Covid-19 was reported to the WHO. As of today, Thursday 9 April 2020, we are one hundred days in to living with the virus.We asked our expert journalists to look ahead and forecast what the next 100 days will hold. What is the outlook for their sector? Which key questions must be answered? And what will their world look like 100 days from now, on Saturday 18 July? The areas covered are as follows: The UK, the world, science, politics, the NHS, lockdown and social distancing, the economy, small and medium businesses, personal finance, property, sport, the arts, environment, education, mental health, physical health, travel and Brexit.These are their responses.If the first 100 days of this pandemic have been characterised by collective shock, denial and now frustration, we should expect the next three months to be marked by our adaptability. It’s what pychologists call the Kübler-Ross model, or the “five stages of grief”, and is a useful way of thinking about what the coronavirus holds for us over the weeks and months ahead. The model is usually shown as a bowl-shaped curve with the “shock” on the high left, a steep descent into depression and then a slow but steady rise to a new normal.The upward slope of the curve may have been what The Queen had in mind when she told the nation on Sunday: While we have faced challenges before, this one is different. We join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. We will succeed – and that success will belong to every one of us”.The shock of the past 100 days has been brutal, but the green shoots of recovery are becoming evident. The way we came together to demand a lockdown in order to protect the most vulnerable among us is testament not just to our humanity but our good sense. Darwinian forces may have shaped us but we see ourselves as a society not a herd. You see it too in the millions of small chores and errands people all over the country are running for those less able than themselves.Scientists from all disciplines have also grown in stature and confidence. They are displacing ideology with evidence and knee jerk reaction with reasoned decision making. They are also embracing cross-border cooperation and transparency like never before. One of the first papers providing hard evidence that infection with the coronavirus creates protective antibodies in our blood was published yesterday by a team of Chinese scientists and shared instantly around the world. In the same vein, the once secretive scientific committees advising ministers in Britain have taken to publishing, not just the abbreviated minutes of their meetings, but the substance too in order that others can constantly test and critique their decision making.Even the public are becoming involved. Perhaps the best view we have of the spread of the coronavirus in Britain is provided by data from the Covid Symptom Tracker app, used by over two million ordinary Brits. The latest figures estimate that 1.4 million people in the UK aged 20-69 have symptomatic Covid-19, a fall from 1.9 million on the 1 April.While scientists are working round the clock on treatments and vaccines, thousands of other experts are collaborating on the economics and logistics of getting our factories, schools and high streets up and running again.Don’t expect lockdown to end within the next 100 days but we will almost certainly know the shape of it by then.Life is unlikely to fully return to normal until a vaccine or treatment is found but with good planning and direction from the top, it should be possible for large parts of society to be at least partially freed-up without the virus spiking dangerously again and overwhelming the NHS..If there is a risk in front of us, and there surely is, it comes less from the virus itself but the profound economic and political shock which the world will experience in its wake. We know from history that such shocks like this can spark conflict and already China and the US are squaring up to each other, stoking palpable fear and tensions.Covid-19 has exposed the world’s frailties and its strengths: we humans have a long established habit of messing up before dusting ourselves down and starting over again. Be in no doubt, we will get back on our feet. The only real variable is how many people will die unnecessarily in the process.There are really only three kinds of country in the world today: those slowly waking from the coronavirus nightmare those in the middle of it and those who are about to be hit.All face the same brutal dilemma: how to balance human lives and public health with economic sustainability.Over the next few weeks each will see their latent weaknesses, and perhaps strengths, exposed in unforgiving light. And the outcomes will vary dramatically according to national wealth.China, South Korea, and Japan, the advanced economies which suffered the first wave of the coronavirus crisis, will try to ease their city lockdowns without allowing a resurgence of the virus.But early signs are that it will be a tricky and long-drawn out process. Tellingly China has still not rescheduled the annual meeting of the National People\u0027s Congress, which was postponed in March, suggesting Beijing is not quite confident that progress is irreversible.Meanwhile, developed countries in Europe and North America where the epidemic has yet to peak will remain focussed on saving lives. Lockdowns may be extended into the early summer, and tensions over the economic, social, and political consequences will rise.The mounting death rate in the United States in particular poses an immense challenge to president Donald Trump in the run-up to November\u0027s presidential election, and could challenge orthodoxies around healthcare.Everywhere, the global economic slowdown will have knock-on effects with as yet impossible to predict consequences.The Kremlin\u0027s spokesman warned Russians last weekend to be braced for a perfect storm economic crisis lasting up to two years.  But alarmingly, a third wave hitting the developing world is only now taking off.With neither the healthcare capacity to handle multiple cases nor the economic reserves to survive the shutdowns that saved lives in Europe and East Asia, the outbreaks are likely to last longer and claim many more lives.Aid agencies are especially worried about conflict zones like Libya, where an outbreak of the virus has failed to slow the fighting, and refugee camps, where cramped conditions and rudimentary sanitation mean thousands of people will likely die if the virus takes hold.  In the world\u0027s largest refugee camps in Cox\u0027s Bazaar, Bangladesh, there is not a single venilator for more than 800,000 Rohingya refugees who fled a genocide in Myanmar in 2017. Médicines sans Frontier have described the camps, which are overcrowded and unsanitary as a ticking time bomb.The first 100 days of the coronavirus have brought the economy to a ‘hard stop’ the likes of which has never been seen before.Preventative action to stop the spread of the pandemic has forced the shutdown of swathes of British and global productive capacity.The next 100 days begins with a reckoning in the jobs market. Economists expect GDP to fall by as much as 20 per cent by the end of April.JP Morgan estimates such a fall would be expected to push up unemployment from below 4 per cent at the start of the year to as much as 13 per cent - far worse than the financial crisis or the recessions of the 1980s and 1990s.Almost 1m have signed up for benefits already. Typically that would cause serious scarring as some of the unemployed lose touch with the world of work for years, finding it hard to get a job and seeing their skills lose value as they are not kept up to date with modern employment.If the furlough schemes and business support efforts work the unemployment rate could be limited to around 7 per cent, staving off the worst social and economic effects of the crunch.The next key factor is the length of the shutdown. If restrictions begin to be eased in May, a rapid bounceback seems possible. Retail and hospitality can begin to reopen, bit by bit.Domestic travel can recommence. Workers on furlough or working from home can get back to normal work. Government efforts to ‘bridge’ this period with grants, loans and wage payments will have largely succeeded in keeping the economy from collapse.“We expect the economy to rebound quite swiftly, should quarantine measures be lifted sometime before the third quarter,” says economist Sanjay Raja at Deutsche Bank.This would not restore the economy to its previous peak instantly. International travel and large-scale events will take longer to return to normal. Lost education, training and investment could also take time to be recovered.Behaviours could change, too. Businesses and households may build up more savings to keep themselves safe from any ‘second wave’ or other future lockdown. That is the good scenario.But if the shutdown carries on into June or even to the end of the next 100 days, the economy could look very different.More businesses and jobs will have been lost for good. Those who are still standing risk lower incomes or higher debts. Businesses will be less willing to fund new investment in a weaker economy, and workers risk losing their skills after a prolonged period of forced rest.In that case, a long depression could lie ahead.In early January the World Health Organization issued an alert warning that a “pneumonia of unknown cause” had been identified in Wuhan, China. Just a few days later the mystery illness was confirmed to be a novel coronavirus and within a week Chinese scientists had published its full genetic sequence. Since then, experts across the globe have been scrambling to uncover the virus’ secrets. While miracles will not happen overnight, never before have scientists been so united in a common pursuit – and already a remarkable amount of progress has been made. “There is this spirit of collaboration,” Nick Cammack, therapeutics accelerator lead at the Wellcome Trust, told The . “Science is the exit strategy.” Looking forward, there are three key areas that experts are honing in on. The first is to answer the outstanding unknowns: How many of us have already had the virus? How common are asymptomatic carriers? And how much immunity, if any, do we acquire after surviving an infection?Widespread antibody testing will unlock many of these answers, as accurate assays will be able to detect prior infections and identify whether we are approaching widespread immunity. Scientists at the UK’s high tech, high security facility at Porton Down near Salisbury are among those who have already started this work – expect answers in the near future. Identifying effective treatments is another essential area of focus. While experts have started to track down completely new compounds that could be used to attack the coronavirus in the future, the most promising option right now is to repurpose existing drugs.Antimalarial treatments first tested during the Second World War (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), a combination drug used to treat HIV patients (ritonavir and lopinavir) and an antiviral first developed to treat Ebola (remdesivir) have all been pitted as potential cures, alongside convalescent plasma therapy and anti-inflammatories.While hundreds of clinical trials have started during the pandemic, it is the “megatrials” launched by the WHO, University of Oxford and French firm Inserm that will offer the most conclusive results as they have the largest sample sizes. Initial results for some of the potential therapies could start to emerge within a month. The final, and perhaps most critical, tool is a vaccine. About 35 companies and academic institutes are racing to create an inoculation and four candidates have already been tested in animals – but experts have warned it will be at least a year, if not 18 months, until a safe vaccine is ready for widespread use. Efforts are under way to speed this process up. Bill Gates announced this week that he would build factories to manufacture the seven most promising vaccines – even though this would “waste” billions of dollars, as the Gates Foundation would only ever mass produce two candidates. It’s a sign, if you needed one, of just how seriously the international community is taking the coronavirus threat. “Science is the exit strategy” might be a savvy soundbite, but it’s also true. The NHS has worked at full throttle to plan for the peak of the coronavirus outbreak, creating 10,000 extra intensive care beds at NHS Nightingale Hospitals and asking tens of thousands of retired medics and students to join the fight. Consultant surgeons have retrained as ICU nurses, as operating theatres and labour wards have been converted into Covid-19 wards.  When the peak comes in the next 10 to 20 days, with London and the West Midlands expected to come first, we will see if the preparations were sufficient.Staffing will be a major pinch point. A workforce deficit of 100,000 before the crisis will be compounded by medics going off sick - up to 25 per cent of staff are already self-isolating, according to the highest estimates. Increased testing will help, but medics will need to adapt.Nurses in ICU, who normally look after one patient at a time, could be asked to monitor half a dozen at once, while doctors will improvise with anaesthetic machines when ventilators are all in use and move patients around the hospital to maintain oxygen pressure. After insufficient amounts of PPE equipment were delivered in the early days of the crisis, fixes to the supply chain should hold up.As hospitals reach capacity, ambulances will be re-routed to NHS Nightingale Hospitals. NHS Providers has early confidence that hospitals won’t become overwhelmed, as they were in Italy, but is concerned about the effect on community services, such as GPs and social care. Frontline charities, such as St John\u0027s Ambulance, will need to draw on new funding from the Government in order to support the NHS.Coronavirus deaths will be commonplace, and medics will find themselves standing in for loved ones. They will facilitate video calls with family members, play comforting music, and hold patients\u0027 hands as they take their last breath. Medics will also die. There could also be a rise in non-corona deaths, as patients avoid going to A\u0026ampE and miss out on treatment.After the peak hospital admissions will plateau, but it will take weeks for the effect to be seen on wards as critical patients recover. Lockdown measures will help avoid a second peak, while contact tracing and immunity testing will become key.“People are putting on brave faces when in fact they are crying inside,” one ICU doctor tells me. NHS staff will rely upon a new NHS mental health helpline and ‘wobble rooms’ to ease the burden, but some will suffer from PTSD. Without a doubt, though, they will continue to work as hard as they can.As Dr Qian Xu, an A\u0026ampE doctor, says, “We are all scared, just like everyone else, but we have a professional duty to fight this war.The lockdown has obviously pushed us further apart. We can\u0027t see loved ones we can\u0027t go to work the public sphere, famously described by Jurgen Habermas as the place where ideas and experiences are freely exchanged, is gone. Even if we do go for a walk, we have to keep two metres apart, and our faces are hidden behind masks. This is deeply ironic given how much time Europe spent debating whether or not women should wear the Burqa.On the other hand, this is the closest we\u0027ve come to a collective experience in years. We are suddenly watching the same news and digesting the same information. We\u0027re probably talking to each other more than ever over phone and internet, and hundreds of thousands have volunteered to help the NHS. There is evident national pride at the construction of NHS Nightingale, the largest critical unit in the world, in just nine days.Criticism of politicians and suspicion that we might be getting this wrong, is balanced by the feeling that we\u0027re all in this together, even if all we can do is shout hello from a safe distance.But these are early days. Lockdown Britain is going to have to process two traumas. First, death. People die all the time, but rarely in one go and with the same condition, and never with this degree of media attention. Given the scale of mortality it\u0027s likely that almost every family will be touched by it but, due to the lockdown, we\u0027ll be denied many of the usual rites and companionship that we rely upon to cope with grief.Second, we are going to have to confront the trauma of prolonged boredom, unemployment and loneliness. There\u0027s been growing awareness in recent years of the link between mental and physical health, that if you are depressed or unstimulated, physical problems follow. Well, now we are engaged in a mass experiment in enforced isolation or, just as difficult, being stuck with the same person for a long period of time. One suspects that as frustrations increase, so will tensions between the generations.The phrase things will never be the same again is almost as over-familiar as stay at home - but it\u0027s not necessarily true.Some things will go straight back to normal when the lockdown ends because we miss them and we want them back: the pubs will be jam-packed and flights will sell out. But the Coronavirus could always return for another season, or some other disease, so we are likely to be left feeling very vulnerable for a long time.Sport’s shutdown narrowly allowed the real Cheltenham Gold Cup and has just given us the Virtual Grand National. In between, the industry’s business model has been exposed as over-reliant on TV deals and reckless with its salaries for players.Pent-up longing will bring fans swarming back into stadiums. Britain’s love for sport was always deep but now we will see new heights of appreciation. But football, in particular, has stretched the public’s loyalty, with billionaire-owned Premier League clubs using the government’s furlough system to transfer staff wage costs to taxpayers. The cries of poverty emanating from many clubs and sports organisations have invited scrutiny around how they are run and where all the money goes.With Euro 2020, the Olympics, Wimbledon and The Open lost or postponed, the English sporting summer, a mainstay of our culture, has been wiped out. Another hundred days from now, in mid-July, cricket’s new smash-ball form, The Hundred, teeters as August and September become the best hopes for a resumption. The Hundred was meant to be cricket’s new goldmine but may not be seen until 2021.Football’s quandary is the most pressing. It hopes to complete the 2019-20 season before the next one can commence in August - or later - in large part to avoid paying rebates to broadcasters for uncompleted fixtures. Last season in the Premier League, Liverpool amassed 97 points but still fell short of the title, which they have not won for 30 years. This time they are 25 points clear with nine games left but are at the mercy of a microbe.Industry watchers predict a “bloodbath” as budgets are slashed and jobs cut. Sport’s complacent belief that the show would always go on has unravelled in the face of a pandemic - and even superstars have lost their omnipotence. Many will be feeling physically and mentally frazzled and will need time to regain their form.A country in need of life-affirming spectacles is desperate to see them back from their lockdowns. Yet the financial damage will take many years to correct. A return to the old ways of funnelling vast revenues to the performers and their agents with no structural underpinnings would show that lessons had not been learned.Hopes remain for live sport in July, or perhaps more realistically, August, but mass gatherings will be the last of the prohibitions eased by the government, so we may see sport proceed at first with turnstiles locked.One hundred days ago, Boris Johnson and the Conservative Party were still basking in the glory of an unexpectedly large election triumph. That victory came from a transformation of the party. A new Tory coalition was forged from disillusioned Labour voters in the Midlands, the North and Wales through a politics that was more Left-wing when it came to splashing the cash, but more Right-wing on key social issues such as immigration.Nowhere was the transformation more clear than at the new Chancellor, Rishi Sunak’s Budget, where he opened the spending taps for tens of billions on roads, rail and broadband.Yet that Budget also marked a turning point. Mr Sunak announced £60 billion of spending to battle the economic fallout of the Coronavirus pandemic. Within days he was announcing billions of pounds more. And more again a few days after that. By then, all other priorities were on hold.As for the next 100 days, several major questions hang over the Government. The most obvious and immediate is how and when to lift the lockdown. Ministers and their scientific advisers are juggling a number of factors. They know that collapsed businesses and raging unemployment could lead to health problems just as damaging as the epidemic itself. But move too soon, overwhelm the NHS and see death rates from any and all illnesses and accidents spike, and the economy would be in dire straits anyway.When it ends, the epidemic will have complicated significantly the long-term goals of the Tory Party. The pandemic creates serious problems for “levelling-up”. The cost of supporting the economy through the lockdown will have piled tens of billions onto the national debt. How much room will be left for infrastructure? And will the global economy be stalling or roaring back? That matters for the public finances, but also for the regions that the Tories want to boost. Regenerating post-industrial towns is hard enough without a global recession.But is there a case for optimism? The economic recovery, which many still hope will be swift and dramatic, could provide a significant chance to reorder the economy. The Government has a major task ahead in reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, but it could target the post-virus stimulus not only at lifting up the regions but at transforming public transport, energy production and housing in the process. Here’s hoping.As this lockdown continues, one thing has become apparent to most families in Britain: we need teachers.  On March 20, schools across the UK shut indefinitely to all but the children of key workers in order to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. In an unprecedented move, GCSE and A-level exams will not take place instead, GCSEs, AS and A-levels will be awarded in July based on mock data, inidual assessment and prior attainment. Many have questioned the accuracy of these, particularly for black and minority ethnic, working-class and other marginalised students. Students may also be allowed to sit exams early in the next academic year or in summer 2021.The next three and a half months will bring us up to the end of summer term. The Government has said it will assess the situation after Easter, but most educators in Britain are preparing for the likelihood that schools will remain closed through May and, most likely, through the end of the summer term. While a study released this week by University College London concluded that closing schools may not have a big impact on preventing the spread of Covid-19, most around the world remain shut.What does this mean for learning? On one hand, the British education system is sensibly repetitive. “Homes aren’t schools, and nor should they be,” notes Dr Dan O’Hare, an educational psychologist at the University of Bristol. “They worry is that children need a lot of ‘learning’ - but the curriculum is pretty repetitive and they’ll have covered it before, and will cover it again.”The greater loss during this period is social, says Dr O’Hare. Whether four or 14, children rely on classroom interactions to build and maintain the social skills that will carry them through life. Adolescent development relies on peer identity. To keep that skillset going, Dr O’Hare says social media, with parental supervision, can be a very positive tool.The provision of education at home during this period is deeply uneven, and the degree to which parents are able to lead home-learning has exposed deep isions: while some parents may be organising four hours of focused, supported study each day, others in the same school may be struggling to feed their children.Some educators have taken the cancellation of exams this year as a chance to reconsider the British education system. The UK is alone in Europe in assessing twice (at 16 and 18), and in offering such a narrow range of subjects at the final school assessment level (A-level). Even the inventor of the GCSE has called for them to be scrapped perhaps this period of reflection will allow educators to step back and re-prioritise the outcomes of our education system?Twelve years ago – the last time the global economy was brought to its knees – it was the banks that needed bailing out. This time it’s everyone else: borrowers, savers, renters, homeowners – and yes, even landlords.Politicians and regulators have made it very clear that Britain’s banking system must now repay its debt and support the taxpayers who, as a result of the 2008 crisis, endured austerity and a lost decade of wage growth while property prices took ownership out of the reach of many younger workers.Banks have fallen into line, agreeing various “holidays”, from mortgage payments to extortionate overdraft fees. It seems certain these will now be extended into the next 100 days.I’m afraid the real economic hit will not be fully revealed for some time yet. Currently furloughed workers are having 80 per cent of their wages (up to £2,500 a month) guaranteed by the Government. A much-needed safety net, but one that doesn’t do much to help employers who must stump up the cash today, and claim it back later. At best, this is keeping thousands of firms on life support. When that is withdrawn, we will see unemployment figures soar, in line with the truly terrifying figures coming out of America. It will be far, far worse than the financial crisis.If that does come to pass, payment holidays of all stripes will need to be extended – there’s no chance of unemployed people being able to meet repayments. Applications for Universal Credit, the main out of work and low-income benefit payment, have already surged. Expect another wave in June. Universal Credit has already been increased, to just under £100 a week, and may need to be raised again.Most at risk is Britain’s five million-strong self-employed army. While Rishi Sunak did (eventually) extend his bailout to people who work for themselves, millions are still missing out on any help whatsoever. By mid-summer, what little cash reserves the prudent have set aside may have been burnt through, and struggling businesses will have cut contractors and other third parties to control costs. Mr Sunak has all but confirmed the self-employed will have to pay him back with higher National Insurance costs in the future. Though he may be forced to backtrack, as former chancellor Phillip Hammond was, given this could be seen as a “tax on entrepreneurs”.The self-employed and anyone who fills out a tax return have had a reprieve on this year’s “payments on account”. This second tax deadline will now be due in January 2021, not July this year. More help may be forthcoming when the scale of the challenge facing the sector becomes apparent.  Students and parents of children at nurseries and fee-paying schools face a nervous wait. Will they get any refunds? So far, institutions are resisting particularly where they are offering online services. If the lockdown is still in place in 100 days they may be forced to offer refunds, even if that means they enter dire financial straits.Anyone with a big chunk of their assets in the stock market will be hurting – a lot. The FTSE 100 index of the biggest British companies has lost about a third of its value since the start of the year. Billions of idends have been cut, and will likely not resurface for years. Yet there is a growing case for arguing this is one of the best times in history to be investing. In three months’ time, brand-new investors or people putting their cash into markets now, might already be sitting on healthy profits. Pick the right stocks and in 20 years’ time, well you might just be a surprise entry to the ranks of Isa millionaires.A screenwriter I know claims he has never been so busy  – the film industry has in the last fortnight gone into overdrive, he says, looking for material to fill the gaps that will occur when the lockdown lifts, with every studio determined to be ahead of the game.The same is true throughout the arts. Having rolled out programmes of streamed content to ensure some continuity, the movers and shakers have knuckled down to the conference-call business of forward planning for the autumn and beyond.Not much is likely to happen before September. Glyndebourne still fondly hopes to reopen on 14 July, and at the time of writing the BBC Proms (theoretically kicking off on 17 July) hasn’t yet been canned. But the Edinburgh festival jamboree in August is off, and West End shows aren’t likely to reopen in a hurry when there will be scant traffic, either touristic or domestic.So the focus is now on shifting dates and contracts to counter the loss of short-term income and minimise unnecessary risks: expect the announcement of some extra-long panto runs, and a lot of performances of tried and tested hits such as Carmen, Swan Lake and A Midsummer Night’s Dream. ENO is replacing its autumn Coliseum season with 10 weeks of the musical Hairspray.The good news is that the Chancellor has been quick to recognise the sector’s needs and decent concessions have been made, even if the sums involved are hardly on the German scale of 50 billion euros. Gift Aid can now be claimed on tickets not refunded, and Arts Council England has relaxed National Lottery rules so that money that would otherwise have channeled to capital projects can be used for emergency aid to the arts instead, without cost to the Treasury or the taxpayer. Some extra grant will be necessary for museums not under the ACE umbrella – could its source lie in the £120 million currently allotted to the Brexit Festival of 2022?The biggest challenge facing the arts over the next 100 days is to predict how taste and demand will change as a result of the trauma of the crisis – quite apart from the effect that straitened incomes will have on people’s ability to pay for entertainment. But be in no doubt: the arts are highly resourceful, imaginative and upbeat - and they have an absolutely central role to play in the national recovery.In another world, Glasgow would be gearing up to host the international climate summit COP26 in July, the biggest moment for climate diplomacy since the Paris Agreement was reached in 2015.Its postponement until next year pauses desperately needed international cooperation to keep global warming at 1.5 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels.That might not be such a bad thing. You will be hard-pressed to find many observers who held out high hopes for the outcome of the summit.The talks will now take place in a changed world.What may turn out to be the greatest impact of the crisis is the overturning of many of the assumptions that underpin our consumption-based emissions. Do we need to fly to that conference, rather than join online? Can we all adjust to working from home more and limiting our car journeys?Meanwhile, it has reminded us of the value of the natural world. Suddenly, we are desperate for the restorative powers of the great outdoors, and the local wildlife has come out of hiding. The zoonotic origins of the disease may prompt a rethink about our relationship to wildlife and bioersity. China is under pressure to permanently ban wildlife markets, believed to be the source of the virus.Already we can see the benefit to the environment of our changed behaviour. Carbon emissions and air pollution have dipped during the shutdown China’s annual CO2 emissions are estimated to have fallen 18 per cent. Air travel is down more than half.Clearly, these cuts are unsustainable in the current mode and are likely to bounce back, as we have already seen in China, unless they are translated into long-term changes.Questions over how we will rebuild have rightly largely been put aside for the time being as the world focuses on saving lives and getting back to work. But in 100 days we will start to see more conversations about where we want to focus our resources and whether the post-Covid stimulus packages should be invested toward a greener world.The prospects for that are mixed, so far. The response in the US is likely to be decided in the November presidential election. Already Donald Trump has relaxed environmental requirements for the fossil fuel industry, citing the crisis.China has also relaxed some environmental regulations and early indicators suggest it has ramped up production in those areas of the country where the lockdown has eased.The EU has said it remains committed to its Green Deal, but there have been calls from Poland and the Czech Republic for it to be put on hold.The other big question for the next few weeks is what role will international cooperation play? Should we start to see a united front in the fight against this virus, it may reinforce the power of collaboration to face a common challenge. Again there, so far, the outlook is not rosy.For many, the anxiety set in slowly. As people washed their hands to the tune of Happy Birthday with one eye on the news, talk of mass death and draconian lockdowns started to fill our social media feeds. It sounded hysterical at first, but it wasn’t long before all our lives had changed beyond recognition. 100 days in, and our so-called “new normal” has left us with a mental health crisis which is gathering speed.It’s no surprise given how much has changed. We are now unable to see and touch our loved ones, even when they are dying. We don gloves and masks for the occasional nervous visit to the supermarket, we are at risk of being shouted at by police on our daily government-sanctioned hour of exercise, and we hover over our finances and food supplies with trepidation. All those little routines we never used to think about - the quiet building blocks for our resilience - shattered in a matter of weeks. Meanwhile, we live in fear of an invisible virus and obsess over symptoms lists.Public Health England’s guidance on how to cope with this brave new world includes maintaining contact with friends and family via the telephone, video calls or social media, keeping to a regular sleeping pattern, and focusing on a hobby. It’s perfectly sensible advice, but it can’t come close to addressing the damage this crisis is doing to our mental health.A recent Ipsos-MORI poll revealed 62 per cent of Britons were finding it harder to stay positive about the future in the face of the pandemic. Meanwhile 80 per cent of young people with a history of mental ill health have found their conditions have worsened since the crisis began. Distressing reports coming from Covid wards suggest there may be many frontline workers, survivors of the virus, and bereaved families requiring mental health support in the coming months.One hundred days in, we still don’t know when this will end, nor how, and it’s impossible to predict exactly where we might be 100 days from now. But while we can’t control what happens in the coming weeks and months, we can try to get a handle on how we react to all this. Mind, which was given a £5 million grant by the Government last week to administer to mental health charities around the country, advises that we all take extra steps to help combat anxiety during this period.Take a break from the news cycle maintain social contact stay hydrated, well fed, mentally stimulated and physically active keep taking your medication if you are on any (if you have a repeat prescription you might be able to order it by phone, online or using an app, and your GP can still have an appointment with you over the phone) and above all don’t leave it too long to seek help. Start by talking about how you feel with someone you trust. Start today.I don’t have to look far to find a picture of how exercise has changed over the past 100 days. As I write these words from the shed at the bottom of my garden, I can see my neighbour doing inverted press-ups, using TRX bands that he’s strung from the back of his house. Inside my own house, my partner and kids are learning ‘spidey squats’ with Joe Wicks on YouTube. Later, I’m hoping to nip out for an hour on my bike, to take advantage of the empty roads. On a weekday.The last time I checked, before coronavirus made its way to the UK, we were in the doldrums of February - a time of hibernation and cancelled gym subscriptions. Now, a few weeks later, it’s as though we’re back in the heady days of early January, intent on working off the excesses of Christmas. Exercise is everywhere and we’re not deterred by barriers from getting it. Yoga studio closed down? No problem: we’ll do a class over Zoom. London Marathon cancelled? Who cares: we’ll run it virtually. Gym doors shut? What you want is Wicks on the TV, or some TRX bands in your garden.The question for the next 100 days is simple: will we keep going? New Year, New You health kicks tend to slide into guilty deferrals (‘next year, new me’). So how resolute is this current trend?I have hope. All around us, exercise is being reframed as an expression of our freedom. When it’s the one thing you can do outside every day, going for a run or a ride feels less like a chore, more like something that’s actually quite fun. The lockdown might not be in place in 100 days\u0027 time, but perhaps the reminder that exercise makes us feel good, and it\u0027s freely (or easily) available to everyone, will stay in our minds?The gym industry is going to have to work out where it fits in this new, more egalitarian world of exercise. The traditional gym certainly won’t die - you’ll always have people who want to work out away from their own homes, and the hardcore bunnies who love the wrought iron atmosphere - but expect big chains to start competing for the online class space. And don’t be surprised if you see personal trainers trying their luck here either: online workouts offer a way for them to teach clients without having to pay rent or commission to a gym landlord. Embrace Zoom, and you might just find your weekly PT session dropping in price.For the nation’s backbone of small and medium-sized businesses, surviving the next 100 days will be an achievement in itself.  They are adaptable and resilient, but few businesses could emerge unscathed from the plunge in demand triggered by the coronavirus lockdown.From cheesecake makers in Preston to door-makers in Buckingham and car-parts makers in Worcester, erse businesses are facing the same stark question: How can you carry on, when the customers have disappeared?Added to the practical problems of poorly staff and looking after their own families, life in recent weeks has been a difficult haze for the millions of striving bosses in this crucial sector which supports 22m employees.Much of their energy since the national lockdown on March 23 has been spent trying to navigate the financial support put in place by the government - on hold with banks, haggling with landlords over rent holidays, deferring VAT payments, or talking to equally stressed suppliers.Only once those conversations have taken place and options are exhausted will it become clearer which businesses will make it through. Insolvency practitioners are braced for a wave of business once bosses work out where they stand.It\u0027s clear the government support will not solve all of businesses’ problems, even with the welcome improvements to the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme that were introduced at the start of April, and pressure on banks to lend.Many companies are reluctant to borrow given the uncertainty over how quickly demand will recover. Putting staff on government-funded paid leave is helping bosses avoid lay-offs, but doesn’t help those who still need workers to help re-right the business, but cannot afford to pay them.Given the shock to demand, there is stress on all sides, and no easy way out. Legal challenges loom between suppliers and customers, tenants and landlords. Radical solutions being floated -  such as getting stronger companies to take over struggling rivals or the government taking equity stakes - are likely to gain more traction.Yet the simple biggest help to many companies would be some clearer guidance about when lockdown might be lifted - for financial planning as much as a psychological boost to bosses thinking about throwing in the towel. Hence ministerial attempts to dodge questions about the exit strategy are exasperating.In the meantime, companies will need to adapt, and many are already doing so. Many are selling vouchers for when they re-open making use of back-up supply chains organised during preparations for a no-deal Brexit opening up new online sales channels or even putting resources at the use of the NHS.There is hope then, that July 18 will be marked by successes along with the inevitable defeats.As the world has ground to a halt, virtually all travel companies are facing an existential threat. March would normally have been an important month for advance bookings - airlines and operators rake in cash as people book ahead for their spring and summer holidays. Instead, the vast majority of flights have been grounded and the industry - from hotels to airlines - has spent the last five or six weeks trying to cope with a deluge of cancellations and requests for refunds.Without more help from the government or a sudden change in fortune, significant numbers seem certain to collapse under the financial strain. We are likely to end up with fewer travel agencies, tour operators and - probably -  airlines too. We may well see some big names go under.But the one thing which would help save the bulk of the industry is the main summer holiday season. As chance would have it, the next 100 days of Covid-19 will take us to July 18. That’s just before most schools are expected to break up for the summer - assuming they return in the meantime. It is peak time for nearly all holiday companies - the six weeks or so when they make their key revenues for the year.The prospect of a successful summer is now on a knife edge and depends on two things. First that lockdown is a success, not just in the UK but also in the key Mediterranean holiday destinations, and it can be relaxed sufficiently to allow international travel. And second, that people feel confident - and solvent - enough to take a foreign holiday. Given the chance, the travel trade will no doubt attempt to drive bookings by offering exceptionally good deals. Even so, they are likely to have a battle on their hands to win back custom.France seems likely to be one testing ground. Once restrictions are lifted, we may see the first shoots of recovery among British travellers taking their own cars across the Channel. But the recovery of air travel will be crucial. Some airlines - Jet2 for example - say they will start flying again on May 1. Ryanair and British Airways look more realistic in planning for a significant increase in services from June onwardsBritain’s biggest tour operator, TUI is allowing customers to postpone existing bookings made before the end of June. Clearly it is hopeful to be able to operate during those key months of July and August.In short, the timing looks incredibly tight. If we are to avoid a lost summer of foreign holidays and the decimation of the travel industry, the battle against Covid-19 needs to go seamlessly.The prospects for holidays in this country look more rosy, however. Assuming travel restrictions in the UK are lifted relatively soon, hotels, holiday cottages, camping and caravan sites should be well back on track by mid July. Given the pent up demand from a public driven stir-crazy by lockdown, this summer may be boom-time for British holidays.So far, coronavirus has frozen the housing market, begun a mass withdrawal of mortgage options and halted most major housebuilding projects. Buyers and sellers have been thrown into a painful limbo. And many have started to worry seriously about house prices.So what’s next? First, transactions are going to tank. The government has effectively banned house sales unless buyers and sellers are legally bound to go ahead. In some weeks in April and May, Capital Economics forecasts falls in mortgage approvals and transactions of more than 90 per cent year-on-year. This would match what happened in China during lockdown. Overall, across the next three months, the research firm expects a 70 per cent drop in sales compared to the same period in 2019. Sales are unlikely to resurge fast after lockdown has been lifted. Savills has based its predictions on an assumption that transactions will stay at as much as 40 per cent below their five year average until September. Estate agents’ commission books are going to take a nasty hit.But that is not the same as a house price crash. It is in fact possible that so few transactions will take place that there won’t be enough data to produce some house price indexes.When the lockdown lifts, some purchases that were put on hold will go ahead as previously planned, but everyone in the market will be newly cautious - buyers of getting into negative equity and vendors of under-selling. We will almost certainly be in a recession. Stock levels will be low, but some people will have to take price cuts and sell. Savills forecasts a short-term price drop of between 5 and 10 per cent.Still, the number of forced sellers should be low. The Government has made swift measures to protect jobs, earnings and home ownership. Airbnb landlords, who will have lost their cash flow with the collapse of the travel industry, will find themselves on a pressure point. In 100 days, we will have seen a mass influx of these properties first to the long-term lettings market, and then perhaps to sales. But far more home owners should be stable than in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.Then, as with the crash in the early Nineties, the house price plunge followed a period of exponential growth. This time around, our market was not volatile but tentatively recovering from a low base. Many buyers who currently have transactions on hold haven’t thought about renegotiating because they had already got themselves, say, a 10 per cent discount. There isn’t the same cliff edge to fall off. Overall for 2020, both Capital Economics and Knight Frank forecast price falls of only 3 per cent, with recovery starting in 2021.This was meant to be the year Boris Johnson would get Brexit done on January 31, and dusted on December 31 by seeing the United Kingdom out of its transition period on time.The first part of the Prime Minister’s plan went off without a hitch, thanks to his election win helping him steamroller parliamentary opposition. But his hefty Commons majority has not been able to stop Covid-19 from throwing a ner in the works of the post-Brexit talks.After negotiators faced off in their first round of talks at the start of March, the UK and EU had to ert increasing amounts of money, manpower and attention to the raging pandemic rather than preparing for life fully outside of the bloc. Coronavirus soon made it unsafe for negotiators to meet in person, with Michel Barnier and his British counterpart David Frost having to lie low after showing symptoms of the disease.With negotiators reduced to a back and forth of emails and attempts to make the most with remote communication technology, progress has been glacial. Talks have little advanced from opening demands. But in less than 100 days, both sides have to decide if they want to extend the transition period in order to allow more time to negotiate their future relationship.Before coronavirus reared its ugly head, Boris Johnson threatened in February to ramp up preparations to leave without a deal unless negotiators made enough progress by June, nailing down key areas like fisheries and financial services. With the sufficient progress now nigh-on impossible, barring a last-minute erasure of red lines in a desperate grab for a deal, the Prime Minister will have to decide how ready he is to make good on that threat.Meanwhile, European politicians are piling pressure on him to seek a delay, knowing well how vehemently he ruled out such an idea.The UK Government insists for now that it will not budge in its refusal to string out negotiations, but even stalwart Brexiteers are bracing themselves privately for such a delay to be agreed. Expect it only to happen at the very last minute ahead of the July deadline, when it is beyond doubt how badly Covid-19 has disrupted everything.Coronavirus has already struck down the Prime Minister, UK and EU negotiators and any chance of both sides steaming towards a good deal by July. Mr Johnson will be fighting until the last minute not to have its cherished transition deadline enter its own “delay phase”.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"many people may already have immunity coronavirus german study","story":"Many more people may have been infected with the coronavirus and acquired immunity than previously thought, according to a groundbreaking study in Germany.Scientists studying the town at the epicentre of Germany\u0027s first major outbreak said they had found antibodies to the virus in people who had shown no symptoms and were not previously thought to have been infected.Initial results released on Thursday suggest as many as 15 per cent of the town may already have immunity — three times as many as previous estimates.The findings suggest the mortality rate for the virus in Germany is just 0.37 per cent — five times lower than current estimates.“This means a gradual relaxation of the lockdown is now possible,” Prof Hendrik Streeck, the virologist leading the study told a press conference.“Because the people in Germany have been so careful and disciplined, we are now able to move on to the second phase.”But Angela Merkel dashed hopes of an early end to the lockdown, telling Germans: “We must not be reckless now. We could very quickly destroy what we have achieved.”The study in the town of Gangelt in Heinsberg district is the first in Europe to research the effects of the virus on an entire community.Scientists from the University of Bonn are testing around 1,000 people from 400 households for antibodies as well as signs of current infection.Initial results based on around half the tests found 2 per cent of inhabitants are currently infected and 14 per cent had antibodies to the virus. Allowing for overlap that suggests 15 per cent of people in the town now have immunity — compared to the previous estimate of 5 per cent.The 15 percent is not that far from the 60 per cent we need for herd immunity, Prof Gunther Hartmann, another of the study\u0027s leaders, said.“With 60 to 70 per cent herd immunity, the virus will completely disappear from the population. Then the elderly are no longer at risk.”The figures cannot be extrapolated to the rest of Germany because Gangelt had a higher rate of infection. But the study\u0027s authors said they were grounds for cautious optimism.  An immunity rate of 15 per cent is already enough to slow the spread of the virus significantly, they said in a joint statement.The findings suggest the mortality rate of the virus may be lower than previously thought. The study found a mortality rate of 0.37 per cent, compared to Johns Hopkins University’s current estimate for Germany of 1.98 per cent.The study\u0027s authors said their findings could be closer to the real figure for the virus because they had detected so many previously unknown infections.“The much lower mortality rate in Gangelt is explained by the fact this study is detecting all infected people, including those with no symptoms or very mild illness,” they said.Antibody testing for the virus is still in its early stages. Chinese scientists released a study confirming they had detected antibodies for the first time this week, but warned they were unable to detect any in some patients known to have been infected.It is unclear how long any immunity to the virus conferred by a previous infection will last, although experience with similar viruses suggests it will be in the range of a year to 18 months.“I think the most important thing all governments can do to address the virus is to get reliable data,” Prof Streeck, the study leader, told the . “We don’t yet know enough about this virus.”The study’s authors said the findings were grounds to begin lifting the current general lockdown and move on to a phase of isolating the vulnerable groups most at risk.Jens Spahn, the German health minister, earlier suggested an easing of the lockdown could be possible after Easter “We are seeing a positive trend, but it must continue,” Mr Spahn said. “If it does, we will be able to talk… about a gradual return to normality after the Easter holidays.”But Mrs Merkel appeared to play down hopes for an early easing of restrictions amid concerns people may be less disciplined about social distancing over the Easter holidays.“I would like to be the first to tell you everything is as it was and we can go back to normal, but that’s not how it is, she said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"air pollution drops drastically across uk annual global carbon","story":"Air pollution has fallen by up to 60 per cent in some cities in the UK since the start of the lockdown. Meanwhile global carbon dioxide emissions were predicted to fall 4 per cent this year, a historical drop, because of the slowing of air and road traffic and heavy industry.Levels of nitrogen dioxide, caused by road traffic, dropped significantly across the country after the government introduced a nationwide stay-at-home policy on March 24 and road traffic dropped by more than 70 per cent. Monitoring points in London, York, Bristol, Glasgow and Nottingham were among those which saw their levels of air pollution halved. The A472, in Hafodyrynys, Caerphilly, which regularly tops the list of most polluted spots in the country, saw its levels of NO2 drop 48 per cent according to the data from Defra, which was released by the BBC.Nitrogen dioxide impairs lung function, and particularly affects those with asthma. A similar story has been seen across the world, with clear skies reported in notoriously smoggy New Delhi and Beijing as cars and heavy industry grind to a halt. International air traffic has fallen by an estimated 40 per cent, and by 89 per cent over the UK.But experts have warned that the change is unlikely to be permanent, with areas of south-east China already seeing a return to regular levels of air pollution.A report from UK-based website Carbon Brief yesterday suggested global carbon emissions could fall by 1,600million tonnes, representing 4 per cent of the global total.The analysis looked at data from the global oil sector, the EU\u0027s carbon trading scheme, India’s electricity sector and the economies of the US and China, which it says accounts for 76 per cent of global CO2 emissions. But the report said even a cut of emissions on this scale would not be enough to limit global warming to internationally agreed levels, which would need to be at 6 per cent every year for the next ten years. “To put it another way, atmospheric carbon levels are expected to increase again this year, even if CO2 emissions cuts are greater still,” analyst Simon Evans wrote. “Rising CO2 concentrations – and related global warming – will only stabilise once annual emissions reach net-zero.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"did new york become coronavirus capital world","story":"New York has now become the coronavirus capital of the world, recording more cases than any country across the globe.As of Thursday, the state, which is home to some 19.5 million people, had recorded 159,937 Covid-19 cases - the highest subnational total.It has now surpassed the number of infected people in every country worldwide other than America itself, overtaking second-worst hit Spain, which has 152,446 cases, and Italy with 139,422. The US, as a whole, has 462,000. China, where the virus is widely thought to have originated, has so far tallied 81,865.Not only does it have the dubious honour of having the highest number of cases of any single place on Earth, the coronavirus is also claiming more lives here than almost anywhere else.New York has recorded more than 7,000 deaths in the 39 days since its first case was recorded in early March, accounting for more than a third of the US total of 16,000. The number of coronavirus deaths New York has eclipsed those in China, Iran and Germany.Total coronavirus fatalities are now at 3,335 in China, 4,110 in Iran and 2,349 in Germany, the latest data shows.The country with the most fatalities so far from coronavirus is Italy with 17,669 deaths, followed by Spain with 15,238, according to the data.The city also looks to be on a steeper curve than Lombardy, Italy, which was considered the epicentre of the outbreak in March.New York is now regularly recording more daily deaths than Lombardy recorded at its height, but it has taken three fewer weeks to get there and is still rising.On Monday, it recorded 731 deaths in 24 hours, representing the highest single-day increase in the death toll since the crisis started. But the record was broken again on Tuesday, with 779 cases and yet again on Wednesday, which saw 799.Lombardy’s highest single-day death toll reached 919 in late March, but even at its height it did not regularly see numbers above 700.New York has also got here much quicker than Lombardy, which recorded its first cases long before its outbreak plateaued.In his briefing to the press on Thursday, Andrew Cuomo, New York’s Governor, however, pointed to the latest hospitalisation stats to suggest the worst might be behind them.Some 200 net new hospitalisations were tallied over 24 hours, the lowest number since the crisis broke out. That daily admission number had been as high as 1,400 just last week. Likewise, the rate of new intensive-care admissions and intubations -- when patients are put on a ventilator -- also plummeted.About 18,000 people in the state have been hospitalised with the virus. After early models predicted a wave as big as 135,000 coronavirus patients, New York nearly doubled its hospital capacity to about 90,000 beds.The new figures on the rate of hospitalisations suggest that the state will need far less hospital capacity than it now has.Mr Cuomo was cautious about showing too much optimism. “I don’t want to get into a retrospective when we’re in the middle of the game,” he told reporters. But added: “The expert models were all off.”Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that the apparent flattening of the infection curve might mean that the city could reach a second phase as early as June that would relax restrictions on movement outside the home.But this would require much more testing and a continued practice of social distancing.Some suggest the answer lies in the amount of testing New York has carried out.Sure, the state has been testing at a higher rate than almost anywhere else in the US, but it is still much lower per capital than in China, Germany, Italy and South Korea.Trump’s travel ban targeted the wrong countries, new study suggestsPart of the answer could lie in new research reported on Thursday.A series of studies suggested that one of the first strains of coronavirus to hit New York came from the UK and Europe, not China as suspected.It found that an early case of the virus in the city was in all likelihood indirectly transmitted by an inidual who brought it across from Britain.But while President Donald Trump barred foreign nations at the end of January from entering the US if they had been in China, it was not until mid-March that similar restrictions were placed on travellers from most European countries.In one example researchers at the Grossman School of Medicine traced the case of a Long Island resident with no travel history who tested positive for Covid-19 in early March.Dr Adriana Heguy, of the school’s Department of Pathology, found that the Long Island patient’s viral genome correlated with that of a strain circulating in Britain, suggesting the patient had contact with someone who had carried the virus from the UK.Scientists at Mount Sinai Hospital have also written a study indicating that coronavirus began to circulate in the New York area by mid-February, weeks before the first confirmed case, and that the travelers who brought in the virus did not arrive from Asia.The US initially limited testing only to people who had come from China in the two weeks before January 31 and displayed symptoms of Covid-19.Lockdown restrictions not strict enoughGov Cuomo took measures to close New York down, but the lockdown has not been anywhere near as austere as in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, or indeed the hardest-hit parts of Europe.They were also taken much later than the aforementioned. New York ordered all schools closed by March 18, by which time it had already recorded thousands of cases. The city is one of the most densely populated areas of the country and for some it has been hard to isolate and practise social distancing.That spatial closeness makes us vulnerable, as Mr Cuomo put it.Pictures from subway stations in the poorest parts of the city, Queens and the Bronx, have shown crowded platforms. The rate of the spread of the infection in these boroughs - where people in lower-income jobs continue to leave the house for work - has left hospitals struggling to cope.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/family/2020/04/08/TELEMMGLPICT000228334483_2_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqg5ozdfdQpDHsa6AO6OAwnlabMGzIC_NZv763wN-vL4o.jpeg?imwidth","title":"resurrection christ shows can find light even present darkness","story":"A church parishioner watches a laptop inside Liverpool Parish Church (Our Lady and St Nicholas) in LiverpoolJesus’s victory over death tells us that we can have hope even in the face of unimaginable sorrowOne night, in 1499, the young Michelangelo, aged only 23, broke into the Chapel of Santa Petronilla and chiselled into his first masterpiece the words, “Michelangelo Buonarroti, Florentine, made this”.The masterpiece is, of course, the Pietà. He made this addition after hearing it said that a rival sculptor, Cristoforo Salari, was widely believed to be its creator, since Michelangelo himself was considered too young to have produced such a remarkable work of art. He later regretted his outburst of pride and never again added a personal signature to any piece of his work.The Pietà belongs to Good Friday. It depicts, with utter tenderness, the moment when the dead body of Jesus, taken down from the cross of his execution, is laid in the arms of Mary, his mother.The Pietà is a powerful image for all of us today, as we follow, with mounting dread, the daily roll-call of the number of people who have succumbed to death, attributed to the vicious work of the coronavirus. I cannot remember a time when such gruesome statistics were the headline of every news bulletin.The Pietà is an image of profound tragedy and sorrow. It speaks to the heartbreak of mothers in every time and place. Yet it does not match the sharpest of sorrow among us today.Today, mothers, daughters, sons and even the closest of friends are not able to embrace or even touch their loved ones in that final journey into death. They cannot care for their bodies. They must stand back from their lost one, and distance themselves even from each other, as the body is brought to its final resting place. What sorrow can compare with this? What scars this will leave, burdens to be carried for years to come.The eyes of faith struggle to pierce this darkness. If we are to cling to hope in this saddest of times, we need to follow closely in the footsteps of Jesus. He alone breaks through this darkness. He does so only because he is the Son of God, the Creator. If this is not so, then he, too, is helpless before the brutality of death.As God he conquers. Yet he is also one of us, fully one of our flesh. Without this human nature of Jesus, his victory would remain out of our reach. But, as wholly one of us, his victory is shared with his brothers and sisters, offered to the whole of our human family.The footsteps of Jesus that we follow today bring us to his death. Yet there are more, unseen footsteps that lead us further on. Only by following them do we come to realise the fullness of the victory he brings.From its beginnings, the Christian creed has proclaimed that after his death and before his appearances to his disciples, the victorious Jesus “descended into hell”. He entered the realms of every extreme darkness, bearing the cross, the weapon by which he had won victory. By means of his cross he broke open the tomb of death. Now he carries this cross, not to Golgotha, but into the presence of every forgotten soul and broken spirit. By the power of the cross, wielded by him as God, he belittles the death that defeats each of us.To us, his brothers and sisters, in every time and place, Jesus proclaims, “Arise O sleeper and rise from the dead and Christ will give you light!”The images of today are powerful: death coming in slow suffocation an inconsolable mother embracing her dead son the shattering of a dream and of a company of friends. The onset of total darkness. Such a day hardly deserves the title of Good Friday.Yet when we follow the invisible footsteps taken by Jesus after that cruel death, then a crack of light begins to open before us.This death is not the end this mother will receive her consolation this cross becomes the weapon of victory, breaking open the tomb and leading all who have died, reaching out for mercy in a triumphal procession. In this ine light, today becomes Good Friday.May this light uphold us in our dismay and guide us in our every word and deed.Cardinal Nichols is Archbishop of Westminster and author of The Glory of the Cross, published by SPCK and available on AmazonThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Downing Street offered the Government\u0027s full backing to police forces seeking to enforce the restrictions over the holiday period.But there was a rebuke for Northamptonshire Chief Constable Nick Adderley after he suggested his force could mount road blocks and search shopping trolleys to check if people were going out to buy non-essential items.Home Secretary Priti Patel told talkRADIO: That is not appropriate, let me be clear on that. That is not the guidance.The Health Secretary, who has himself recently recovered from coronavirus, warned: “If you don\u0027t want us to have to take the step to ban exercise of all forms outside of your own home then you\u0027ve got to follow the rules”. But how likely is it that the government will take this extreme step?At 1 p.m. (BST) on Friday 10 April, the \u0027s Front Bench Editor, Daniel Capurro will be answering your questions on what further lockdown measures from the government might look like.Leave your questions in the comments section at the bottom of this article. Alternatively, if you are reading this on the  app, or don’t have a  account, you can submit a question by emailing your queries to yourstory@telegraph. If you would like to remain anonymous, please disclose this when you ask your question. Despite the warnings, Housing and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has confirmed there are no imminent plans to ramp up social distancing restrictions.Mr Jenrick has advised parks should remain open unless it was impossible to maintain social distancing. He also confirmed he had spoken to some local councils.This is their decision, but I have asked them to be very judicious in taking that step and only to do that where they feel it is impossible to maintain social distancing rules within their parks or open spaces, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.The minister also expressed his sympathies to those who relied on public parks as their only source of greenery. “It would be very unfortunate if we had to do so and make it harder for people, particularly people who live in flats in towns and cities, to get the exercise they deserve”. Mr Jenrick’s sentiments were shared by Councillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson chairman of the Local Government Association\u0027s culture, tourism and sport board. Police patrol Clissold Park in Stoke Newington to enforce the coronavirus lockdown.Councils know that parks are a lifeline for residents needing to get some exercise or fresh air and are great for physical and mental wellbeing.This is why councils want to keep parks open, but people need to follow the social distancing advice, otherwise councils will be reluctantly forced to close them as a last resort to help prevent the coronavirus spreading.While this weekend has seen the police ramp up their presence, senior police officers have called into question the practicality of enforcing a ban on outdoor exercise. Jayne Meir, Assistant Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, told the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme: I can understand people are looking at further restrictions. It would be really difficult to police iniduals on a daily basis. Everybody has to take personal responsibility for this. It’s a collective responsibility to stay at home.As for now, the guidance remains unchanged  - exercise once a day, with members of your household and within areas local to you. Read more: How long do lockdowns last?

The total number of coronavirus cases in the country has increased\u0026nbspto 157,022\u0026nbspfrom 152,446 yesterday.Thursday\u0027s death toll was 683, a fall after two previous days of increases.MP calls for churches to able to open doors on Easter SundayAn MP has questioned why\u0026nbspchurches\u0026nbspwill be forced to keep their doors closed on Easter Sunday while off-licences are allowed to open.Jack Lopresti, the Conservative MP for Filton and Bradley Stoke, has written\u0026nbspto housing secretary Robert Jenrick to call for for a temporary relaxation of social distancing restrictions to allow people to attend church to engage in private prayer while observing social distancing.He added:\u0026nbspIf the government allows for me to go to an off-licence, a takeaway, or a local shop on Easter Sunday, providing I observe social distancing or take other necessary precautions, why can I not go to Church and say a prayer, providing I do the same?But the\u0026nbspBishop of Chelmsford, Stephen Cottrell, responded on Twitter: The thing is this: in order to buy food I have to go to the supermarket (unless I am fortunate enough to be able to get it delivered) but God always does a door-to-door service - from God\u0027s heart straight to my heart, wherever I am.Many\u0026nbspchurches\u0026nbspused the internet to adapt\u0026nbspto the restrictions placed upon due to coronavirus, with the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby set to deliver his usual Easter sermon by live-stream on Sunday.New York has more coronavirus cases than any nation outside\u0026nbspUSNew York state, which has become the global epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak, now has more cases of the virus than every country in the world outside of the US.​There have been\u0026nbsp159,937 confirmed infections statewide, more than half of them in New York City,\u0026nbspaccording to the latest figures announced on Thursday.Spain, which has had more infections than any country other than the US, has recorded 153,222 cases, while Italy has confirmed 143,626.New York state\u0027s death toll of 7,067 is more than every country outside the US except\u0026nbspItaly, Spain, France and the UK.5,000 stranded Britons to be flown home from IndiaThe Foreign Office has announced 12 more\u0026nbspcharter flights to transport home thousands of British tourists who are stranded in India due to the global travel shutdown.The dozen flights, which will carry 3,000 people,\u0026nbspopened for bookings today.They come on top of seven flights from Goa, Mumbai and Delhi already scheduled between 8 and 12 April. The first of those arrived at London Stansted yesterday morning with 317 people on board.In total, the 19 flights will transport about 5,000 stranded Britons home, the Foreign Office said.Lord Tariq Ahmad, minister of state for South Asia and Commonwealth, said the government\u0026nbspwas doing all we can to get thousands of British travellers in India home.He added: This is a huge and complex operation which also involves working with the Indian government to enable people to move within India to get on these flights.Johnson must rest as he recovers from Covid-19, says PM\u0027s fatherBoris Johnson has to take time to recover from coronavirus after leaving intensive care yesterday, his father\u0026nbsphas said.Stanley Johnson played down suggestions his son could quickly return to work at No 10 in comments that indicate foreign secretary Dominic Raab will continue to deputise for the prime minister in the coming days.The PM\u0026nbspreturned to a ward at St Thomas\u0027 Hospital in London yesterday after spending three nights in intensive care.His father told the BBC\u0027s Today programme: To use that American expression, he almost took one for the team.This is pretty straightforward now.He must rest up. As I understand it, he has moved from the ICU into a recovery unit but I don\u0027t think you can say this is out of the woods now.He has to take time. I cannot believe you can walk away from this and get straight back to Downing Street and pick up the reins without a period of readjustment.Johnson added his\u0026nbspfamily was\u0026nbspamazingly grateful for the efforts of the NHS and for the\u0026nbspoutpouring of support for his son.Cabinet minister \u0027should resign if he cannot explain alleged breach of lockdown rules\u0027Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, is getting flak this morning for allegedly breaking lockdown rules twice while\u0026nbsptelling the public to remain indoors.The minister was subject of two stories last night which saw him accused of flouting restrictions.First, \u0026nbspreported Jenrick had visited his parents in Shropshire last week - driving 40 miles to their house despite having made media appearances warning the public not to be tempted to visit loved ones.Defending himself, the housing secretary said his parents were self-isolating and had asked him to deliver some essentials, including medicines. He\u0026nbspinsisted he respected social distancing rules.Government instructions\u0026nbspsay the public\u0026nbspshould not be visiting family members who do not live in your home, although they make an exception for people delivering essentials.But according to\u0026nbsp, Jenrick\u0027s parents have also been receiving deliveries from neighbours.The Daily Mail\u0026nbsplater reported Jenrick had also travelled 150 miles this week from London to his family home in Herefordshire, where he is now living.One government source told the newspaper his behaviour was idiotic, although a Downing Street insider said No 10 was backing him.Labour\u0027s Steve Reed, the new shadow communities secretary, said Jenrick should resign if he cannot explain why his journeys were unavoidable.He tweeted: So important that Government ministers follow the rules they are laying down for the rest of the country to follow - Jenrick must explain why this journey was unavoidable or consider his position. Rules must apply to everyone.Warnings as UK begins Easter bank holiday weekendPoliticians\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsppolice\u0026nbspchiefs have urged the public to abide by coronavirus lockdown rules as the Easter bank holiday weekend approaches with the promise of good weather.Some forces have warned they may have to crack down harder on those flouting the rules using the powers given to them by law.It comes amid fears the warm weather could see the country\u0027s collective willpower wane, potentially allowing Covid-19 to spread faster.Yesterday Dominic Raab, standing in for Boris Johnson as prime minister, said the country was \u0026nbspstarting to see the impact of the sacrifices we\u0027ve all made.He added:\u0026nbspLet\u0027s not ruin it now.Good morning and welcome to The Independent\u0027s live updates on the coronavirus pandemic.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Version 14 of Unicode\u0027s standards, which would have included the new characters, has been delayed by six months, it said.The Unicode Consortium is made up of most of the biggest technology companies in the world, who work through the group to agree new emoji, ensuring that all the available characters are consistent across platforms and interoperable. But the actual work of the consortium is done in large part by volunteers, and the delay was agreed to ensure they were able to deal with the fallout from the pandemic.New emoji include animals, smiling tears and transgender options“Under the current circumstances we’ve heard that our contributors have a lot on their plates at the moment and decided it was in the best interests of our volunteers and the organizations that depend on the standard to push out our release date,” Mark Davis, president of the consortium, said in a blog post. “This year we simply can’t commit to the same schedule we’ve adhered to in the past.”New emoji work on a long schedule: they are usually finalised in January, but do not actually arrive in new phones until the following September. The new schedule pushes the schedule back by six months, meaning that any characters planned for version 14 are not likely to arrive until the spring of 2022.The delay in the schedule does give an extra six months to anyone planning to submit proposals for new emoji, with the deadline pushed back to September of this year. Anyone can propose an idea for an emoji to the consortium, which then works to decide if the character should be added.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

I was flattered that a young person wanted to portray me on a popular TV show but unfortunately this is where the flattery ends,” she wrote in a statement via her management..A new Tiger King episode is coming to Netflix this weekendNetflix viewers are raving about Spanish thriller The PlatformThe Innocence Files exposes how wrongful convictions tear apart lives“I did not respect being described as a ‘old cookie woman’ or being depicted as a washed-up actress who has taken too many drugs... I wish Aiden had given me the common courtesy of a “heads up” and maybe I could have given him a few lines etc, to say on the show.”The actor\u0026nbspalso attacked Zhane’s fellow contestant Sherry Pie for using a tremor to impersonate the late Katharine Hepburn.“From my portrayal to making fun of Katherine Hepburn’s neurological disorder, I found the show tasteless,” she wrote.Pie, real name Joey Gugliemelli, was disqualified from the show after multiple men claimed he tricked them into submitting “disturbing” audition tapes by “catfishing”.Season 12 of RuPaul’s Drag Race has continued to air as planned, but Pie will not appear in the final and the show has matched each of her cash prizes with a donation to LGBT suicide helpline The Trevor Project.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here’s how to take the perfect picture of it:Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUse a landmark to get perspectiveEveryone will be taking pictures of the supermoon by itself, but some of the best pictures show the moon next to a land mark or trees and houses, which is what helps to give the picture “a sense of place”, says Nasa’s senior photographer, Bill Ingalls. “Think of how to be creative – that means tying it into some land-based object. It can be a local landmark or anything to give your photo a sense of place.”Created with Sketch.9 best images of the 2016 supermoon Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016Pick the best spotLocation isn’t everything, but it can definitely help with getting a perfect picture of the supermoon if you have time to plan it. You can look up the best monuments or statues in your area to photograph the image of the moon against, like Mr Ingalls does in Washington D.C., where he lives. “It means doing a lot of homework. I use Google Maps and other apps – even a compass – to plan where to get just the right angle at the right time,” he told Nasa.Use an app to find the moonUnless you\u0027re an astronomer, the best way to know where the moon will rise or set is to use a app on your smartphone to locate it. There are several free or cheap options you can choose from, each using your phone\u0027s inbuilt accelerometer to know which way you\u0027re facing.The apps can also tell you what phase the moon is in, while some even give other celestial details, like the location of planets and star constellations. Decent options for iOS and Android devices include Star Chart, Sky Safari and Skyview.Get the right exposureIf you’re taking a picture on your camera, control the light balance by first tapping the screen where the moon appears to get the camera to focus on the object before dragging your finger up and down to play with the exposure. “You’ll usually want to drag it down for underexposure to be sure you have all the highlight detail,” National Geographic photographer Michael Christopher Brown said.Use a tripod for your camera or rest your phone on a solid surfaceDavid Reneke, an astronomer and writer for Australian science magazine told ABC.net that if you’re using an SLR or DSLR then it’s important to play with aperture settings on your camera to photograph the supermoon, but that using a tripod is essential.It’s worth using a tripod for taking pictures with a smartphone too, as any camera shake can compromise the quality of the pictures – but if you don’t have one to hand you can simply rest your phone on a window ledge.For older smartphones that use a digital zoom rather than an optical zoom, it’s generally best not to use the zoom as it could compromise the quality of the image. Instead, take the picture and then crop it.Newer phones like the Huawei P30 and P40 series feature incredible zoom capabilities that can take detailed pictures of far away objects. Other cameras come with special features to improve pictures of the night sky, such as the Google Pixel 4’s Astro mode.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He was terrified of these tigers. He was scared of all the animals. I remember a peacock landing on him and he freaked out. He broke its neck and fed it to the tigers.”Exotic\u0026nbspis is currently serving 22 years in prison for hiring someone to kill animal rights activist Carole Baskin\u0026nbspas well murdering tigers to make more room in his Oklahoma nature park.Kirkham claimed that Exotic would hug the tigers while the cameras were rolling, but accused him of “kicking” them once they were switched off.“I watched him shoot several animals just because he was p***ed off,” Kirkham said.Exotic’s niece recently said the TV star was “100 times worse” than what viewers saw in the docuseries, while Louis Theroux – who filmed a BBC show with him in 2011 – claimed the zookeeper said he would kill all of the animals he owned if his nature park closed down.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But we’re committed to working with others groups and organisations who come might along to help meet the needs of the community in different ways as time goes on.”He said the group has a pool of over 250 volunteers and an on call rota who are now getting several dozen calls a day from people in the area in “real need” of supplies.“Whatever help\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspcan give in mapping the support network across the country is a good thing, especially if it means more people get access to the support they need,” Mr Vine added.Many food aid charities have been struggling with a drop in donations and a fall in the number of regular volunteers.

There are a lot of people are struggling to make rent, struggling with loss of income, struggling to access universal credit, as well as isolating for health reasons.

Yet some arts charities have switched gears and stepped in to help, delivering emergency food packages to people in desperate need.The Auckland Project – an organisation delivering cultural and education programmes in the northeast town of Bishop Auckland – is now leading a huge emergency food operation to deliver supplies to vulnerable people in County Durham.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign has been supporting the work going on across the UK to ensure that everyone has enough to eat during the outbreak, backed by figures such as London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Khan, Labour MP\u0026nbspJess Phillips\u0026nbspand TV cook\u0026nbspNigella Lawson.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Auckland Project is an impressive example of how small groups are adapting to the crisis. Based at Auckland Castle, the kitchen staff at the visitor cafe are now cooking 500 fresh meals a day. More\u0026nbspthan 10,000 of the frozen meals have been dropped off at homes in the area over the past few weeks.“We knew a big section of the community would be hit hard by this, so we felt getting food out to those in need was the best way to help,” said Liz Fisher, one of the directors at the project. “It means big changes, but the staff wanted to do all they could – they really stepped up.”How to support our campaignThe Auckland Project’s team of 17 staff and volunteers has been busy working in the kitchen, preparing dishes such as cottage pie, lasagne, mince and dumplings and carrot cake for distribution.There is a move to grow food locally, too. Two acres of the castle’s walled garden has now been set aside for planting potatoes, beans, leeks, cabbages and asparagus.“Hopefully we can start getting the food we grow here into our meals, and possibly even have a celebration dinner once we get past the crisis,” said Ms Fisher.The charity has teamed up with the South Durham Enterprise agency and another local charity called Health Express to work out which iniduals and families need support.Chris Bowron – owner of The Miners Arms on the outskirts of Bishop Auckland – is also part of the emergency food drive. His closed-up pub acts a distribution hub for the local “mutual aid” group, and Mr Bowron and a team of volunteer drivers deliver around 150 frozen meals from The Auckland Project each day.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I accompanied one of 22 Felix vans that set off across the capital, filled to the brim, to ferry over 20 tons of nutritious food to three of the giant community hubs established in Barnet, Islington and Haringey, and to more than 75 charities and schools.“That’s more than double the 10 tons a day Felix were supplying in normal times.”Mr Lebedev added: “Within days, this picture is set to change dramatically yet again. Felix say\u0026nbspthey expect another 11 community hubs in another 11 boroughs to open their doors to hungry Londoners – and with it, Felix’s output will need to double again.“That is why we at The Independent\u0026nbspare committing our resources to raise another million pounds to prevent food insecurity to people already anxious about their health and that of loved ones. That is why we say: £1m raised, £1m to go. Let’s finish the job and keep vulnerable Londoners healthy and fed.”The deliveries are part of our food appeal’s support for the charities in the London Homeless Collective, the umbrella organisation of London homeless charities that The Independent\u0026nbspis working with through our Homeless Fund. Felix is delivering to other homeless organisations, as well as The Marylebone Project, including Centrepoint.Des Scott, CEO of the Church Army, which runs The Marylebone Project and provides 112 beds to homeless women under the Edgware flyover, said: “Being able to get fresh vegetables is one of the key things we can do to keep these women healthy.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only in China is a lockdown being phased out.\u0026nbspSo much is unknown.The message from the government’s chief scientific adviser and chief medical officer this week has been that the UK needs to get past the peak before lifting measures can even be considered.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut once the pandemic\u0026nbspis over, the government will have to start lifting measures. Here’s what we know about how restrictions could potentially be phased out.The government’s guidelines tell people to avoid going outside except for a small set of activities: limited exercise, buying food and medicine, going to an essential job, or giving care.If lockdown measures are to be relaxed, says Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, it would probably be done by gradually expanding the range of these exceptions.“I would do it one step at a time and expand the number of exceptions more widely in a gradual way,” he tells The Independent.“Then look at the more social things a bit later, and say people can meet with their families now, but don’t go to rock concerts and large pub quizzes, things like that. I think that’s the way it would happen.”Some things would probably\u0026nbspcome before others. But he sounds a note of caution: “We don’t know for certain and I think people are trying to work on this at the moment.“At present the\u0026nbspUK has not made it clear what our exit strategy will eventually be and there are very good reasons for this. We simply do not have enough information to make these decisions now. For example, we still do not have good data on the amount of asymptomatic illness in the community, knowledge that is vital to know what may happen after any relaxation of restrictions.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailOffices and other workplaces\u0026nbspThe government is expected to initially try to get as much economic activity for as little risk as possible: prioritising businesses that contribute to the economy without mixing too many people into one place.“I suspect that what would happen is that we would see relaxation first around areas that are more important to society and the economy,”\u0026nbspsays Prof Hunter. “For example, jobs:\u0026nbsppeople would be able to go back to work, possibly more freely than they are at the moment.”But one of the requirements for workplaces to reopen, says Dr Sridhar Venkatapuram of the Global Health Institute at King’s College London, is a higher level of confidence about who is immune, and who has the disease.“Imagine that your boss calls you and tells you to go back to work: you might say, well, is it safe?” he tells The Independent.“There’s going to have to be a point at which iniduals are convinced that there is safety in being able to go out of their house and engage in work or any of the activities that they’re used to.“So if this phasing out is going to happen there will have to be a dramatic improvement in the knowledge of our infections, where they are, who has them.“You could implement a phasing out policy tomorrow but I guarantee you that a significant population would stay home: because they would say they don’t trust it. A massive amount of testing will have to be done, greater clarity about levels of infections – that all has to be implemented to follow through on the phasing out.”Many jobs that could continue to be done from home might be still advised to do so. There is also the question of how to cater for people who have already lost their job.“They will also be trying to get as many people who are unemployed, I would think, into jobs that don’t have high social interactions,” says Dr Venkatapuram.Pubs, bars and restaurantsBut it would be unlikely that all workplaces would come back at the same time. Those where the risk of the disease being passed around is highest would probably\u0026nbspbe put on the back-burner.“I could still imagine an easing of pressure on people going to work, but not on things like clubs and pubs and bars and cinemas – things that you don’t have to have,” says Prof\u0026nbspHunter.“I think we will initially see an expansion of the number of industries encouraged to return to normal work, then the reopening of schools and, somewhat later, bars and clubs and other entertainment venues. However, we will still need effective disease surveillance followed by isolation and rigorous contact tracing for some months.”Pints and date night films at the cinema might be some of the last things to come back.The closure of schools is one of the more scientifically controversial parts of the lockdown, but\u0026nbspthey might end up being one of the first things to reopen.“I suspect we might open schools again, partly because there is still debate about whether school closures are actually beneficial or not,” Prof\u0026nbspHunter tells The Independent.“We’ve not answered that, and there are very good reasons why school closures, in terms of the children, might actually not be that useful. And if they don’t get that ill, maybe they’re not that infectious – but it is a maybe.”But when schools do eventually open their doors again, it’s possible that they could do so with some restrictions in place on pupils.One study published in The Lancet medical journal, which looks at data from the 2003 Sars\u0026nbspoutbreak in China, suggests students could be prevented from mixing and have social-distancing measures imposed during class.“Interventions in schools, such as closing playgrounds, keeping students in constant class groupsclassrooms increasing spacing between students in classes, reducing the school week and staggering school start and break times across years or classes, should be considered if restrictive social-distancing policies are to be implemented for long periods of time,” says Professor Russell Viner, one of the authors of the study.The Times on Wednesday reported one anonymous “senior minister” saying educational establishments could open again after Easter – though in public the government has given no hint of what might come.Sporting and cultural eventsUnfortunately for sports fans, football matches and other mass gatherings look like they will be the last parts of society to return to normal – they simply involve too many people.“What it will be is a slow allowing people to go back to work where they will not be in crowded or group situations.”Thus, Glastonbury is likely to remain cancelled the Premier League postponed – along with other major events.What will come next?\u0026nbspMost experts are agreed that increased testing and “contact tracing” are crucial to allowing society to return to normal as quickly as possible. But even with these measures, some are warning that\u0026nbsplockdown measures could be switched on and off for months until a vaccine is found, or enough people build up immunity – both prospects are potentially one or two years away.“To see us through the next year or more, we must all prepare for several cycles of a ‘suppress and lift’ policy,” Dr Gabriel Leung, chair of public health medicine at the University of Hong Kong wrote in The New York Times.“Cycles during which restrictions are applied and relaxed, applied again and relaxed again, in ways that can keep the pandemic under control but at an acceptable economic and social cost.” The end of the lockdown may not be the first end of the lockdown.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They usually include:Hayfever sufferers may also experience itching around the face and mouth or an itchy feeling inside the roof of the mouth and a burning sensation in the throat.It may also cause headaches and wheezing, but these are less common symptoms, along with a sore throat.Some of the symptoms of coronavirus may cross over with hay fever in a few cases, so its worth understanding how to tell the dference.We asked allergy expert Max Wiseberg, of Haymax, to explain...He said: “If your mucus is clear, thin and watery it is more likely to be hay fever.”“And although it is called hay fever, a fever is unusual, whereas it is possible with coronavirus.”Max added: “Despite its name, hay fever is not contagious, whereas the coronavirus is - another reason for determining which one you are suffering from.”“To help prevent the spread of coronavirus, it’s important to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth and wash hands regularly with soap and water for at least  seconds.”“Awareness of the coronavirus is key, so it’s crucial to avoid people who are sick and be aware of symptoms.Almost half of all those with hay fever also suffer with asthma - and pollen can irritate the airways and worsen symptoms.Coronavirus is also a respiratory illness and is also understood to cause symptoms which can exacerbate asthma and increase the risk of potentially le-threatening attacks.Emma Rubach, head of health advice at Asthma UK, told The Sun Online: “Coronavirus can cause respiratory problems for anyone.But for the .million people in the UK with asthma, respiratory viruses bring an increased risk of asthma symptoms and potentially le threatening asthma attacks.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day -

especially beds and fabrics - to remove pollen particles.Dry your clothes indoors rather than outdoors to prevent pollen particles being blown onto the clothes by the outside wind.”You should also make sure any pets are well groomed and shampooed, as they can carry pollen particles in their fur, and keep them out of the room where you sleep.There are also conventional over-the-counter medicines which can combat hay fever symptoms.Antihistamine tablets and capsules can relieve most hay fever symptoms – sneezing, itchy, runny eyes, skin irritation, itchy nose and throat – but are less effective for nasal congestion, according to Max.Antihistamine nasal sprays can quickly ease itching, sneezing and watering but generally only proof against mild symptoms.Steroid nasal sprays and drops help reduce inflammation in the nose.They work best for clearing nasal symptoms – itching, sneezing, watering  congestion – and sprays sometimes clear eye symptoms too.Eye drops may reduce itchy, watering, swollen eyes.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we must continue to be guided by the science.About , people have already died from coronavirus in the UK, as of April , while more than , have tested positive for the bug.Englands chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty said he would expect the number of deaths to continue rising for at least two weeks past when the number of people in intensive care starts to flatten off, showing the peak is still some time away.Government advisers now believe April  is the likely peak date.The UKs three-week lockdown mark will be reached on Easter Monday.Legislation behind the mass containment must also be reviewed at least once every  days - with the first due to be carried out by April  at the latest.No easing of the lockdown will happen until at least the end of next week, Mr Raab said - but the strict measures will likely continue for even longer.Ministers have warned that the lockdown could be stretched into May, after warning that relaxing it too soon will kill thousands more.Deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries has previously told the nation that restrictions could remain for the next six months.Englands Health Minister Ed Argar said the country was not at the stage where the lockdown can be relaxed.The lockdown is expected to be lted in stages amid Treasury fears that businesses wont survive past June.On April , the Mayor of London suggested the peak of the virus was ten days away.Sadiq Khan said: I think we’re nowhere near lting the lockdown.I speak to experts regularly, we think the peak, which is the worst part of the virus, is probably a week and a half away.A joint survey on the impact of the coronavirus lockdown upon , UK residents found that % are drinking more booze, and % are arguing with their family or housemates more than normal.Halfreported feeling more anxious or depressed as a result of coronavirus, while one in fivesaid they already cannot afford essential items or housing costs, the survey by Kings College London and Ipsos Mori found.March : Boris Johnson announced a partial, three-week-long lockdown, telling us to stay at home to stop the spread of coronavirus.

Stella was at the front - the star of todays show.It was a joyful scene, but as I shouted Say cheese!, Stella suddenly threw herself onto the floor, pulled off her knickers, pointed her legs upwards and parted them to face the camera.Shocked, Lloyd instantly put down the camera and looked at me.I felt my face crumple, as I blinked back tears.Though we had never seen anything like this before - and there was nothing in Stellas placement file about sexual abuse - we knew what it must mean: shed been sexually exploited.It was a devastating realisation - and one we promptly reported to social workers.Yet it was only one of several signs hinting at our foster daughters horrendous past.Before coming to us, I learned, Stella had stripped off in her first PE lesson at school. She had stood completely naked in front of her classmates, with bruises visible on her upper arms.Then, months into her placement with us, I found Stella had been drawing men with spiky teeth in her sketchbook. One picture showed three smiling men with big, erect penises. Another was of a man with a huge, rounders bat-style arm, reaching down towards her genital area.It was a childs gallery of abuse.Another time, I offered Stella a Lion Bar - only for her to recoil in horror.Though she looked at some foods - like lasagne - as though they had arrived from outer space, she had experienced many new things with us and enjoyed snacks as much as any child.But one glimpse at the Lion Bar and she fled to the end of the garden.It was strange behaviour, yet at the time, we could never have guessed the meaning behind it.That would come from a police investigation - sparked by our reports - which found that Stella had been exploited by a highly-organised, systematic paedophile ring, likely involving her own parents.Barely of school age, she had been photographed naked and passed around paedophiles, while her mum Shannon allegedly used a Lion Bar to control her. It was so, so warped and wrong.Though we will never know the full horror of what Stella endured, we do know she was dumped as a baby by Shannon - then a struggling -year-old mum - and left in her grandmothers care.Her dad Terry, in his late s, was in prison at the time - and when he came out, he took Stella back to live with him in his dingy flat, while Shannon carved a new le for herself where.But unbeknown to Terrys relatives, he had allegedly become involved in child sex abuse images behind bars. Now, alone with Stella, he was perfectly placed to find a child for vile purposes.Later, neighbours would notice a stream of men going in and out of the property.Yet even when Stella was discovered abandoned in the freezing flat years on - surrounded by empty beer cars, her own faeces and her dads pit bull terrier, Sharky - the abuse didnt stop.Instead, she was taken back in by Shannon - whom police believe also became involved in the abuse herself. Eager to make cash, the mum allegedly took Stella on trips to her fathers to be exploited.This will be a living hell for some, she tells Sun Online.I feel for all the women in domestic situations who are being beaten. I feel for the children who are witnessing that. I feel for the children who are being abused right now.There will be a lot of abuse going on.She also says the ageing fostering community is at risk of COVID-, which has already killed more than , people in the UK.I know foster carers that have died of the virus, she tells us.You have to factor in were an ageing workforce. They cant recruit foster carers, sadly, and a lot of foster carers are in their s and s.Louise, a best-selling author and artist who grew up in the care system in Oxford, is currently caring for two foster children.Yet while she says her own experience of lockdown is going smoothly, she acknowledges other foster families will be struggling.Ive looked after children who are deeply violent, she says.I can think of children I have looked after where,they were in lockdown with me, it would be the equivalent of domestic abuse. Weve been held hostage in our own home by an eight-year-old!There will be foster families and regular families who are going to be in a place of hell right now. Exploitation means a betrayal of innocence. It is a sullying of that clean, fresh time of being a ‘child’. There is no way to take that away again - as I know all too well myself.I was also abused as a child: my adopted mother repeatedly starved and beat me. So I know Stella will probably spend much of her le trying to recall, forget, understand and find answers.Her anguish was clear to us the day she finally used her voice.After Lily accidentally dropped some of her belongings, Stella screamed, You f***ing, c***ing t**t, adding: You wait! I will f***ing stick my fist so far up your c*** it will knock your eyes out.It was like a scene from Fight Club, but with worse language.Abused children in the care system, like Stella, need to be approached inidually and sensitively.But unfortunately, they are often simply stuck in front of a therapist or another trained professional in the well-intentioned but mistaken belief it will somehow fix them.I have seen rushed psychologists try to assess kids in just a single hour.Its always budgets versus what is actually best - and budgets usually win.In Stellas case, neither of her parents were convicted over the paedophile ring - her mum vanished during the police investigation and there was deemed insufficient evidence anyway.Today, Stella has many physical scars. The abuse she suffered was so severe shes had to undergo operations - with more lying ahead of her - and will never go through pregnancy herself.But despite what shes been through, shes found happiness - both at my house, and with her adopted dad, Danny, whom shes been living with for years and lovingly calls Dad.They are so lucky to have found each other.Stella brought such joy into our house during her months with us.This week, countless other children like her will be suffering abuse under the radar.To their abusers, the coronavirus lockdown must seem like the perfect opportunity for manipulation and control. Who can help their victims at this time of crisis  Who can hear them When this is over, I think there will be a real need for many, many more foster placements.And like tens of thousands of others across the UK, Lloyd and myself, , will be there, ready to welcome a new precious child into our own blended family for days, weeks, months or even years.In , I have no doubt well receive yet more joy, laughter and happy memories.The NSPCC has more information and advice about child sexual abuse - which affects one in  children in the UK - on its website.If you are concerned about your own thoughts or behaviour towards children, you can phone Stop It Now! in confidence on    or email help@stopitnow.org.uk.If you are a child and someone is sexually abusing you, you can get help and advice from ChildLine – phone  , calls are free and confidential.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Get it on now.”So there it sits, Monday to Friday at pm. The Steph Show, hosted by the former BBC Breakfast presenter, from her Yorkshire home, with nothing for company but a mission statement: “It’s a power hour of positivity.”An easy thing to claim, an impossible thing to deliver without ideas, creativity, content or anything other than secondhand clips and the same old guestsyou’ve seen clogging up every other show recently.The Steph Show has one thing and one thing only in its favour, though. Honesty.She promised viewers it “might be a bit rough around the edges”, and has been utterly faithful to her word, starting last Monday, when Steph went hurtling round her house to show off the remote cameras and then spent the next ten minutes gasping for air.Over the following  minutes, Skype links maled, mobile phones went off and an attempt to kick off a feature about weird dreams, with Keith Lemon, was shut down as quickly as it started.“What did you ask Michael Hutchence in your dream ”“Things he did romantically with Kylie Minogue that . . . ” “OK, let’s move on.”Had you thought day two was going to improve things, you probably banished those thoughts when Steph began with her own epitaph: “If you tuned in yesterday, you’ll know this is the show that isn’t meant to be on yet.”Or any other day for that matter, although Tuesday’s episode was a technical cracker and climaxed when someone rang Steph’s doorbell, mid-episode. We never did find out who, but I’m willing to bet good money it wasn’t Bafta.And so this hypnotic mess continued throughout the week.Thursday, however, was the day the edice really crumbled, as Steph attempted to lead a mass, safe-distance dancing demonstration, from a car-park in Bristol.Until it transpired the choreographer was at such a safe distance from her CD player it’d be another minute or so before it could start.Honestly, you’ve never heard a silence so awkward or so deafening and it was hard not to have a measure of sympathy for Steph and her production team, who’ve clearly been thrown under a bus by Channel .I say a measure of sympathy, because professional northerner Steph is hardly the underdog she’d have you believe.Her close friend, Sinead Rocks, is MD for the regions at Channel ’s Leeds HQ and, while there’s no suggestion she had anything to do with her recruitment, there’s always an assumption Steph McGovern is “a good thing”.Having never concentrated on her work before I’m going to assume this is for box-ticking, rather than professional, reasons, because, based on her performance here, she’s not a good presenter.For a start, she chunters for Britain, has a knack for saying exactly the wrong thingand crunches the gears during an interview like Jack Grealish heading back to lockdown.: “Provided the last laugh in Germany, did you  What are your tips for attracting wildle ” Eh  There’s more than a hint of The Fast Show about her as well.Absolutely everything is “brilliant”, especially when it’s not.

Save Lives . . . including your own.If the Prime Minister being in intensive care doesn’t focus their minds, then perhaps the sight of -year-old Ismail Abdulwahab’s coffin being lowered into the ground by strangers in hazmat suits will serve as a salutary lesson that this isn’t “just like the flu” — it’s a potentially deadlier unknown.Whatever your age, gender, race, health history or fitness level, it could be you. And until you have it, you have absolutely no idea what the outcome will be. No two cases have been the same.You could be lucky and only suffer mild symptoms, you might be less so and have a spell in hospital, or worst of all, you might never come out.The latter has been the harsh reality for — at the time of writing — , people in the UK, a figure that is likely to keep risingthose who clearly think that it won’t happen to them don’t start adhering to the strict behaviour codes that will, hopefully, send this thing packing.Or to put it bluntly, better six feet apart than six feet under.ONE of the positives of the lockdown is the rise of socialising via video apps such as Zoom, Houseparty etc.Some people dress up for a party, others have a virtual dinner together, choirs sing, kids have playdates and my friend and I completed a crossword together.But it has its drawbacks too.I’m due to do a chat with This Morning tomorrow and a virtual paper review from home on The Andrew Marr Show this Sunday, and I’m trying to find a suitable backdrop.The kitchen is too informal, with a real and present danger of either the dog snoring or The Bloke wandering into shot in his, ahem, attractive “lockdown shorts”.A couple of noisy, nesting pigeons rule out the garden, and for obvious reasons the bedroom would be a little too familiar.Most online commentators have chosen a backdrop of bookshelves displaying weighty tomes that convey their vast intellect, but thanks to The Bloke’s fondness for books such as The Subtle Art Of Not Giving a F*** and Is It Just Me Or Is Everything Sh** , I’d have to spend an afternoon sanitising ours.So, apologies in advance, it may have to be the downstairs loo.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealCHANNING Tatum is single again after splitting up from pop singer Jessie J.We know this because he’s reportedly back on celebrity dating app Raya, where his profile reads: “And yes, I used to be a stripper. Sorry.”No need to apologise, Channing.In fact, as any woman who’s seen Magic Mike will testy, it will no doubt be viewed as a considerable asset.DAME Julie Walters has revealed she didn’t tell her adult daughter about her bowel cancer diagnosis until she knew she was in the clear.She says she couldn’t “bear the thought” of -year-old Maisie worrying, so told her she was having her appendix out when, in fact, she was having two tumours removed from her colon.“I couldn’t say the word ‘cancer’ to her,” says Julie, , adding that she also “didn’t want to upset people around me. I wanted to keep it small.”In this social media age when certain celebrities post every thought, utterance and ingrowing toenail, it’s a reminder that some stars manage to keep things private too.LAST week I asked for examples of how you were passing your time in lockdown and there were some absol­ute corkers, thank you.Jigsaw puzzles, spring cleaning and garden maintenance were obvious favourites but Pat Ryan painted his shed rather spectacularly and ardent needleworker Irene Threadgoldis planning to produce “  of rock icons”, one of which is below.Well done everyone. Staying productive is critical for our mental health in these deeply challenging times.PICTURED is the gorgeous model Emily Ratajkowski “walking the dog” for a DKNY underwear shoot early in .Fast forward three years and here she is, walking the dog in the spring of Covid--hit .Emily keeping her clothes on.If that doesn’t convince you of how serious this pandemic is, nothing will.SCOTLAND’S Chief Medical Officer has resigned after being given a police warning for driving to her second home – twice – against her own advice.At an excruciating press conference, Dr Catherine Calderwood issued a grovelling apology for “the mistakes I have made”.Hmmm. If we’re being generous, then driving to your second home when you’ve just issued a “stay in unless absolutely necessary” edict to the nation might be perceived as a “mistake”.Doing it twice is, at best, stupidity, at worst, downright “do as I say, not as I do” arrogance.THE Duke and Duchess of Sussex have revealed the new name for their rebrand after the use of Royal was blocked by The Queen.“Archewell”.Of which, under the circumstances of Harry stepping down as a senior royal, there’s a rather fitting, aristocrat anagram: Earl Welch.We needed research to tell us this FORMER F boss Bernie Ecclestone has revealed he’s to be a father again at the grand old age of .“I don’t see there’s any dference between being  and ,” he says.“You’ve got the same problems I suppose.”Except, of course, for guaranteed death before your child is even out of their teens.SOME good news: They’re making another series of the superb Le On Mars, starring John Simm and Philip Glenister.Less thrilling is the suggestion that it will be set in the modern day.Gene Hunt barking: “Fire up the Toyota Prius” doesn’t have quite the same appeal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For those of you who say this virus is nothing out of the ordinary, a big fuss about nothing – how often do we have a Prime Minister in intensive care We all wish Boris a swt recovery. The country needs a strong leader at a time like this and Boris has proved, in three short months, he is that leader.There have been calls for a national unity government. All the parties coming together to see us through this crisis. It’s happened before, of course — most famously during World War Two, when we had a coalition government led by Boris’s hero, Sir Winston Churchill. We had one during the Napoleonic Wars back in , too, when that short French tosser was causing havoc in Europe.But do we need one now I think not. The only reason people are raising the issue now is because the Labour Party at last has a leader who isn’t actually certiable.Nobody would seriously think that giving power to an oaf like Jeremy Corbyn would help us through this crisis.But there are plenty of other reasons to object. First of all, we kind of already have a unity government.The Conservatives have a whopping -seat majority. In the last opinion poll Boris had  per cent of the country behind him, thinking he was doing a good job. That’s about as close to unanimous as you will ever get in a democracy. The Government, then, has a free hand.Perhapsthis virus had struck back in October last year, there might have been a point. Then we had a paralysed government with no working majority.Battling this virus would have been nigh on impossible in such a position. But the December General Election changed all that.But then there’s this. Unity governments are usually convened when we are threatened by a foreign power — as happened in World Wars One and Two and indeed the Napoleonic Wars. There have been brief exceptions.But by and large we have a unity government to show the foreign power that the whole country is united. The virus isn’t a ­foreign power. It is an insentient microscopic parasite. It doesn’t give a monkey’s who is running the country.But the most important objection is this. We are a democracy. And democracy is no less important during times of crisis than at other times. And we need a competent opposition to hold the Government to account. Boris and co haven’t done a bad job, so far. But there are plenty of questions that could be asked. Did the Government react too slowly  Why do our frontline medical staff not have adequate protection against the virus  Why did we allow planes to land from China, back in March, when the danger was apparent.OK, you may think some of those questions unfair. And asked with the benefit of hindsight. But it is the job of the Opposition to ask dficult questions, to challenge policies and highlight incompetency.I would argue that is more vital now than at any time in the last  years.Labour’s new leader, Sir Keir Starmer appears to be a sensible bloke.He is generally behind the Government in its fight against this pandemic.But he must be allowed to question, in public, the Government’s policies.We are no less unied when dficult questions are asked of politicians.The more those dficult questions are asked, the quicker this virus will be beaten.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealLIFE will never be the same again. No, I’m not talking about this wretched virus for once.The Labour Party has got rid of almost all of its nutters from positions of influence.Diane Abbott has gone. John McDonnell has gone.So has the former chairman, the godawful Geordie Ian Lavery.Corbyn himself will be gone very soon.What are we going to do for a laugh without these clowns spouting rubbish all day long Luckily — thank the Lord! — the genuinely berserk David Lammy has been installed as Shadow Justice Secretary.It’s up to you, now David, you dingbat. Keep us chuckl­ing during these dark days.DONALD Trump has turned his guns on the World Health Organisation.He’s threatened to cut off its funding. He reckons the WHO has handled the virus pandemic very badly.The WHO told Trump he was wrong to ban flights from China at the start of the outbreak because it “wasn’t necessary”.He said: “The WHO receives vast amounts of money from the United States and we pay for a majority, the biggest portion of their money, and they actually criticised and disagreed with my travel ban at the time I did it.“And they were wrong. They’ve been wrong about a lot of things.”He may look like a morbidly obese Belisha beacon in a badly fitting wig.He may sometimes talk out of his a***hole. He may have the diplomatic abilities of a semi-housetrained wolverine.But he may well be dead right on this.SOME experts reckon we could be in a state of lockdown until well into autumn.That sounds pretty grim. But there is a silver lining.It means that tour by Genesis might have to be called off.WHO’S nicked all the flour, then  Can’t find the stuff anywhere.It’s aspeople thought: “Uh oh. Armageddon’s coming. Better make a really nice cake. Maybe a coffee one with walnuts, or something. Or a Swiss roll.” I suppose stockpiling flour is more sensible than stockpiling bog rolls. People seem to have given up on that now. Crisps, though, are selling out really quickly.As I mentioned last week, that’s because most sensible people are sitting on their sofas watching Netflix. And you need a snackyou’re doing that for  hours a day.Plus copious quantities of alcohol. One serious point – round my way, it’s impossible to get a click and collect slot for any of the supermarkets.And it’s been that way for two weeks. I know these are dficult times.And I’m pleased the supermarkets are giving priority to vulnerable customers. But would it tax them too much to take on a few extra drivers LONDON Mayor Sadiq Khan reckons that bus and Tube drivers in the capital don’t need protection kits to keep them safe from the virus.With every day that passes, this looks more and more dangerously wrong.There is growing evidence that the virus is more severeyou catch it from multiple sources. That explains the tragedy of young doctors and nurses dying.And also London bus drivers – nine have died so far.All the people selflessly working in frontline jobs where they meet thousands of people deserve proper protection.These PPE kits cost less than  quid per person. Not much to ask, is it I SEE that my home town is in the news.Middlesbrough has been named the place in the UK where people are least likely to obey social distancing directives.This is almost certainly because they think thatthe virus comes anywhere near them, they’ll kick its f***ing head in.“Come near me, you radged microscopic t**t, and I’ll give you a split lip.”JUST seen a report that says our pets don’t know what the hell is going on.They don’t know why we’re home all the time. And they don’t get why we’re so stressy.I tried to explain to my daughter’s hamster, Alastair, what the problem was.“It’s the coronavirus,” I told it. “We’re all a bit worried.”It looked at me levelly for a moment and said: “Well stop Chinese people eating small mammals, then,” before crapping on my hand and going back to run around on its stupid wheel.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are researching, collating, and passing on advice and guidance in a fast changing environment.The volume of work has, understandably, increased over the last few weeks and they are working through it with all the additional challenges of working remotely.If things are a bit slower than usual, please bear with us as we navigate these uncharted waters. So to my team I say “thank you”.Labour staffer Amelia-Rose Tighe added: I’ve had to procure secure laptops for staff to work at home.We have never had as many vulnerable people contact us needing help.Anyone bashing this- are you expecting staff to travel to work to help constituents or should we just ignore them This money does NOT go in MPs pockets as the headline suggests, it goes into a budget to be spent on running an office.

We all need to take responsibility here. This is not about overreach.“We had scurrilous stories a few weeks ago about officers snooping through baskets and removing Easter eggs and that became a trading standards issue.“That is not what the police are there to do. As I said the police are there for public order.“I will be very candid, not everyone will get this right. It will take a few weeks to have these measures bed in.“We want our public spaces to be respected and utilised in the right way.“This is not about heavy handed law enforcement. I pay credit to the police, and the majority of the British public – these are extraordinary times.“But the fact of the matter is,you’re having a party or having a mass gathering do not be surprisedthe police come up and ask you to stop.“The police are using a common sense approach. Enforcement will always be used as a last resort.”In her interview Priti went on to accuse Yvette Cooper of playing politics and insisted she had given the Labour MP a date to appear in front of the Home Affairs Select Committee.When askedshe was concernedYvette wanted to publicly quiz her over bullying allegations made before the start of the crisis, and whether she wanted to deny those on the record, Priti answered: “This is not what this is about at all.“I have offered the chair of the committee regular briefings throughout this pandemic, including access to classied material.“It is disappointing to see this at the time of the crisis when I have already offered a date. There is politicking going on.“When you look at the work of the Home Office during this pandemic, by making  calls free of charge, through the extension of NHS visas, to ious things we’ve been doing across fraud, cyber, national security, policing every single day and the help we are giving to the front line – a lot of that is self evident.“I quite frankly think it is politicking, when we have given access to the entire committee to the department, to myself in terms of another date.“I just think it’s politics basically.”Priti also went on to give up an update about Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who on Thursday night was moved to a ward after spending three nights in intensive care at St Thomas Hospital in London.She said: “He is doing well from what we’re hearing, but we should take great heart that he is in the care of the NHS. We are rooting for him. He is really great, we just want him to get well now.”“I spoke to him last week, around the last cabinet meeting and then it was clear he was unwell and that he needed rest and recoup.“He has been working flat out leading us through this, we need to give him the time and space to recover. We wish him well.”During the interview Priti went on to say the government were considering new measures to help domestic violence victims and confirmed she would be laying out the plans next week.She said of domestic abuse victims on lockdown with their partners: “This is an absolute priority for the police.“I have spent a lot of time speaking to charities and third parties and also the victims commissioner.“There is a lot of work taking place, I have already been resourcing this area. But of course the longer the pandemic continues there will be all sorts of issues around people staying at home and victims of abuse being with their perpetrators. We are finding other ways we can give them the support but also ways we can do more in prevention and protection.“I have been doing a lot of work with this sector and charities about how we can improve our response and get resources out there on the front line in dferent ways. I will be outlining these in the days to come but I can assure you that when it comes to vulnerable children and domestic abuse victims there is a lot of cross government work taking place.”Priti also discussed the increased threats to the public from online fraudsters since the beginning of the pandemic.She said: “I spend every day looking at threats and risks to homeland security. We are seeing all sorts of things but we are especially seeing new threats from online harms and threats in terms of cyber fraud and breaches of cyber security.“As a result there are more protective measures we are undertaking. For example we are seeing a lot more financial fraud online. We are seeing more activity in the space and sphere on online harms particularly around vulnerable people and children and I am working with the National Crime Agency on this right now.“The wrong types of people, perpetrators of crime are at home and are spending a lot of time on the internet, so a lot of work is taking place across the whole of law enforcement, the crime agency, our security and intelligence services as well.“We absolutely are on it.“I will be very candid, they themselves are facing challenges themselves in terms of how they are working.“Across the policing and intelligence community they are incredible in what they are doing but the intelligence they are being fed in – we are actually seeing less crime but they are actually dealing with more crime because they are able to see more crime, perhaps in a way in which they haven’t been able to previously.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Im a lone parent to a five-year-old. Ive been getting my dad to come and park his car next to mine in the supermarket car park. I leave [the child] in it with a screen and my dad sits in his own car. I do the shopping for both houses at the same time.Others suggested the single mum should ask other pals or family to use click and collect, for someone  pick up and drop off her order.However, it appears that when it comes to shopping, the response from inidual supermarket bosses ies, with some happy to accept kids, while others quote social distancing rules to ban them.Given the confusion, Sainsburys has recently issued a message to customers, advising them children are of course welcomethey are not able to stay at home.The supermarket chain explains that they have a queuing system in place outside stores, and ask you to please queue at a safe distance of two metres apart.We are asking everyone to please only send on adult per household to our shops.This helps us keep people a safe distance apart.Our store teams will be asking groups with more than one adult to chose one adult to shop and will ask other adults to wait.Supermarkets have been working hard to deal with the spike of customers during the coronavirus crisis.Aldi, Sainsburys and Tesco told the Sun they dont have a ban on children in stores, with each supermarket saying parents are able to bring kids innecessary.However, they are asking families to be mindful of how many people they bring along on their supermarket trip.Asda: Asda is capping the number of people allowed in stores at one time. As each branch is a dferent size, the number of customers ies per store.Iceland: The Sun has asked Icelandit is capping the number of customers in store and we will update this story when we hear back.Morrisons: The Sun has asked Morrisonsit is capping the number of customers in store and we will update this story when we hear back.Sainsburys: Sainsburys has implemented a queuing system outside stores and is asking everyone to queue two metres apart. It is also limiting the number of people allowed in its branches.Tesco: Tesco is limiting the number of people who come into stores to help reduce congestion inside.People have been taking kids outside, in the sunshine, to stroll in their local neighbourhood - as part of the once-a-day outdoor exercise allowed by the government.Just make sure you keep two metres away from others also enjoying a walk nearby.The government also says:Unless you are with members of your household, gatherings of more than two people in parks and other public spaces have been banned.If children can stay safely at home, they must, to limit the chance of the coronavirus spreading, says the government.That means avoiding all public spaces, such as playgrounds, theatres and cinemas.

This morning, Professor Neil Ferguson of Imperial College said the social distancing measures appeared to be working better than expected but they would need to see more evidence the spread of the disease was being reduced. We made quite conservative assumptions about the level of contact reduction these measures would result in, he told the BBC Radio  Today programme. There is some preliminary evidence in terms of contact surveys, in terms of data from companies like Google about how people move, that we have seen even larger reductions in normal behaviour, contact, than we would have dared hope.That is good news but we have still got to see that reflected in case numbers coming down.

Rupert Shute, the deputy scientic adviser at the Home Office, has been slammed for the statement which was allegedly used to justy sending staff back to work. According to the BBC, he made the statement during a conference call with the Passport Office on Thursday over workers being asked to go back. In a leaked transcript of a Zoom meeting involving Passport Office managers, seen by the BBC, Mr Shute said: You are no more at risk at the workplace as you would be in your home or at the supermarket. It is about minimising it. We are working on the assessment that  per cent of us,we haven’t already, will get the virus.

The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said yesterday: The government’s view is on stopping the spread of the disease to save lives. The governmentaposs top scientic advisors did originally say the virus might infect up to % of the population. But those estimates were made before strict lockdown measures were brought in to reduce the rate of infection and number of people ill. The lockdown was introduced amid widespread concern about the impact of aposherd immunityapos after government advisors realised the strategy of only slowing the spread of Covid-, and not trying to suppress it completely, could lead to , deaths. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS Union said: “It is absolutely scandalous that HMPO are suggesting our members can go back into work during a pandemic to process routine passports. The cavalier approach to our membersapos health and safety is shameful and ultimately puts them in greater danger of contracting Covid-. A Home Office spokesman said: Her Majestyaposs Passport Office is fully adhering to public health advice across all our offices and adopting social distancing measures to keep both its staff and customers safe. It continues to operate at substantially restricted staffing levels with a signicant number of people working from home where possible, and staff are prioritising emergency cases. Guidance is also available for people who are travelling into work. It was made clear in the meeting that the Governmentaposs priority is slowing the spread of coronavirus and we all have a part to play in order to protect the NHS and save lives. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is standing in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson while he recovers from the virus, told Brits the dramatic lockdown measures would stay in place until there is strong evidence that it is working. In the daily press conference yesterday he said: We are not done yet, we must keep going.

Experts at Warwick University floated the idea this week - which could include reopening schools - because young people face a comparatively lower risk from Covid . Warwickaposs briefing paper, The case for releasing the young from lockdown, suggested releasing those aged - who do not live with older citizens, as the best approach to eventually lting the lockdown. Data suggested it could allow . million young adults to resume their daily lives, and shield society against an economic collapse. Medics and government ministers have made clear the lockdown will not be lted in any way for at least a few weeks, despite a review next week, and have urged people to focus on sticking to the rules. However, ministers are also facing questions about what the exit strategy will eventually be once the number of coronavirus infections starts to drop. Prof Paul Cosford, Emeritus Medical Director of Public Health England, today said releasing younger people earlier than others is being looked at. Asked directly about the idea, he told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: All those are sort of things that will need to be considered and are being considered. Medics have stressed that, while the risk of complications is far higher in the elderly, anyone of any age can fall seriously ill and die from Covid-. Prof Cosford said closing schools was an “important measure” to stop the spread of the virus, but said that despite some tragic cases, children are “at very low risk of getting serious complications”.  He added: “The importance of children’s eduction and children being in school is paramount. “That’s not the only issue, but I could conceive of circumstances in which some of the restrictions are lted sooner and some are lted later.” Asked directlyschools could open in a first wave of easing restrictions, he said: “Maybe. Some countries are looking at that. Other countries are looking at dferent ways of doing this.”  However, Prof Cosford also warned we have an “awfully long way to go” before any restrictions are lted at all, and “several weeks isn’t unreasonable. Let’s hope it’s sooner than that.” Ministers have also refused to be drawn on when schools could reopen, with few expecting them to open their doors after the Easter break and Scotlandaposs Nicola Sturgeon predicting they wonapost. All my experience dealing with any sort of infectious disease suggests once you start getting things under control, that is the time you absolutely need to continue with all your measures so you can bring the disease right down, essentially to crack it across the country, Prof Cosford said.  Professor Stephen Powis, the National Medical Director of NHS England, also suggested the idea was under consideration. Askedrestrictions could be lted by age and geography, he told Sky News today: “Those discussions are still taking place. There are lots of options being looked at.” But just like Public Health England, Prof Powis emphasised we shouldnapost expect any measures to be lted any time soon - and must follow the rules. He added: “This is not something that any country will be able to manage in a matter of weeks. We are going to have to work out a strategy and approach to managing this virus over months.”  It comes as Brits are urged to heed warnings that they should stay at home over the warm Easter weekend. There were encouraging signs on Thursday that the public were largely following the strict guidelines, with traffic levels showing an absence of a mass weekend getaway. The government has launched a publicity drive urging people to stay in their homes - including Easter eggs foil-wrapped with the words STAY HOME, SAVE LIVES.

But the government isnapost planning to actually tighten the law - yet. Instead the focus will be on enforcing the law we already have and making it last longer.  Meanwhile police are preparing for a tough Easter weekend - with threats to search peopleaposs shopping and fine anyone going to bask in the sun. So what can and canapost you do under the lockdown law, what is changing, and when will it all end   Hereaposs the lockdown latest explained. What are the basic lockdown rules  You cannot leave the house where you live without reasonable excuse. That boils down to:Shopping for basic necessities, for example food and medicine, which must be as infrequent as possible One form of exercise a day, for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household Any medical need, including to donate blood, avoid or escape risk of injury or harm, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person Travelling for work purposes, but only where you cannot work from home. Gatherings of more than two people are banned in public - unless youaposre from the same household, or a few other exceptions . And pubs, cafes, restaurants, gyms, funfairs, playgrounds, sports courts, cinemas, theatres, nightclubs, bingo halls, concert halls, museums, galleries, car showrooms, casinos, betting shops, spas, hair and beauty salons, barbers, massage parlours, tattoo studios, skating rinks and more must shut.  What is the punishment for breaking the lockdown  Breaking the rules above without reasonable excuse, or obstructing an officer enforcing them, is a criminal offence and you can be prosecuted. However, you can in most cases avoid a criminal conviction by paying a aposfixed penalty noticeapos issued by the police within  days. The law allows police to issue £ fixed penalty notices - rising to £ for a second offence and then doubling each time up to a cap of £. Police, PCSOs, council officers and other government representatives can also order or force you toto your home, and disperse gatherings of more than two people.  When did the UK go into lockdown - and for how long  The lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday  March. It took effect immediately. Police powers to enforce the lockdown took force a few days later - at pm on Thursday  March. The law says the lockdown must be reviewed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock every three weeks, with the first review by Thursday  April. But reviewing the lockdown doesnapost mean it stops. The law is in force for up to six months without the government needing to write a new one. Will the lockdown be extended for longer than three weeks  Yes. The UK government hasnapost made an official announcement because thataposll only come next week. But ministers, civil servants and  Downing Street have been absolutely clear that April  is much too soon to end the lockdown. Wales has already confirmed it will extend the lockdown. Scotlandaposs First Minister Nicola Sturgeon added: I don’t think there is any possibility, any likelihood of these lockdown measures being lted immediately or even imminently. Even before a COBRA meeting to discuss the lockdown, Downing Street basically confirmed the UK government agrees with Ms Sturgeon.  Why isnapost the extension being announced properly today  Because the government wants to wait to see how well the restrictions are working at reducing cases. A formal announcement will be made on or before April , based on scientic evidence. Whoaposll make the decision  Technically itaposs made by Health Secretary Matt Hancock but itaposll be overseen by Boris Johnsonaposs stand-in, Dominic Raab. Not the PM, whoaposs in intensive care. Downing Street said: The Prime Minister is not working. I think weaposre very clear on that. And he has asked the First Secretary of State to deputise for him. It will be the First Secretary of State who leads the COBRA meeting [on Thursday] and the First Secretary of State who will lead any cabinet decision making process.  So can I go out for a picnic this Easter weekend then  No, absolutely not. Yes, the lockdown is being reviewed, but that absolutely does not mean it has stopped. You may only go outside your home with a reasonable excuse - just like any other day under lockdown. When will the lockdown end  We donapost know. But it will only be lted when the UK is well over the peak of new Covid- cases per day, and thataposs not any time soon. Ministers had hoped the peak would be Easter Sunday but estimates now put it at least a week or two later. Even then, cases have to drastically dwindle too. Otherwise thereaposll just be a second outbreak. The UK government has also repeatedly refused to say what its aposexitapos strategy is. Until we get a vaccine next year, itaposs quite possible they just donapost know yet. Officials havenapost ruled out a partial end to the lockdown, where some people can go outside earlier than others. Or restrictions being lted for a few weeks, then reimposed.  Are even stricter restrictions on the way  Not right now, no. The government hasnapost ruled out making the rules even stricter - such as banning exercise. But No emphasised the focus is on policing the current rules more strictly, not making new ones. Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman said: I think the focus for now is ensuring that people continue to stick by the measures weaposve put in place. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden warned the government may enhance or change the lockdown, but thataposs not happening right now. No said: Weaposve always said thatthe scientic advice suggested other steps are needed weaposd be prepared to take them. But for now our focus is on ensuring the steps we already have in place are properly enforced. What does the law actually say  The lockdown is enforced through a law called the Health Protection Regulations . Importantly, it isnapost exactly the same as the government guidance. You should of course follow both, but it makes a dference to whether police can stop you going about your business. Here we go through a few common situations. Whataposs the full list of aposreasonable excusesapos for leaving my house  Reasonable excuses include, but it appears are not limited to:To obtain basic necessities, including food and medical supplies for those in the same householdor for vulnerable persons To take exercise either alone or with other members of their household To seek medical assistance To provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person, or to provide emergency assistance To donate blood To travel for the purposes of work or to provide voluntary or charitable services, where it is not reasonably possible for that person to work from home To attend a funeral of a member of the person’s household, a close family member, orneither are attending, a friend To fulfil a legal obligation, including attending court or satisfying bail conditions To access critical public services, including childcare school, social services, DWP services, victims of crime services To allow children with shared custody to move between each parentaposs house For a minister of religion, to go to their place of worship To move house where reasonably necessary To avoid injury or illness or to escape a risk of harm.When can more than two people gather in public  Exceptions to the rule are:Where all the people in the gathering are members of the same household Where the gathering is essential for work purposes To attend a funeral To facilitate a house move* To provide emergency assistance* To fulfil a legal obligation* To provide care to a vulnerable person** Where reasonably necessary. Can police fine meI exercise twice in one day  No. Government guidance is clear - you should only exercise once a day. You should follow this advice. But the law itself doesnapost specy how many times you can go out. It just says you may take exerciseyou need to. Meanwhile, guidance has been updated to let people with a medical need go out multiple times a day, for instance people with learning disabilities or autism.  Can police stop me sitting in the park  Yes,you canapost provide a reasonable excuse. You wonapost be surprised to hear the list of possible reasonable excuses does not include sitting, having a picnic or sunbathing - evenyouaposre doing it with proper social distancing. Police have of course been asked to show discretion, and there are exceptions in the rules for people with a medical need. Can police go through my shopping  The law isnapost % clear - but the Home Secretary has said itaposs not appropriate. It comes after a police force threatened to go through peopleaposs bags to check for non-essential items. After an outcry, Northamptonshire Police later claried: We absolutely will NOT be searching peopleaposs shopping trolleys in Northamptonshire. Home Secretary Priti Patel later said this is not appropriate and branded it heavy-handed. So thataposs all good. But what does the law say  The law says you can go out to buy basic necessities, including food and medical supplies. So you might interpret that asyou start buying non-essential items, youaposre breaking the law. But the government also says open shops donapost have to pull all their non-essential items from stock. So Sainsburyaposs can carry on selling, say, kidsapos toys and paddling pools - and thereaposs nothing to stop you buying them. Shops that are still open are free to sell any items that they have in stock, Downing Street told us. Yet Downing Street also told us: When we ask the police to carry out enforcement of any rules we give them discretion on how to do that. Thataposs the nature of policing in the UK. They have set out in guidance to officers that they should engage, explain, encourage and then finally enforce.

Everyone understands the importance of supporting doctors, nurses and other staff on the frontline. That is why you came out in your millions again last night to applaud our  brilliant national health service. But the battle against the pandemic is not just being fought in our hospitals and surgeries. In the scramble to shore up the NHS, the Government appears to have neglected the half a million people in care homes. These residents are almost exclusively in the high-risk category. Yet care home operators say they have been ignored and are struggling to get the help they need. Many are short of staff because workers have had to go into self-isolation. Others desperately want personal protection equipment such as face masks and gloves. One home in Luton has reported that  of its residents have died and tragically there are more cases emerging across the country. Without urgent action more lives will be lost. We cannot allow these homes, offering comfort and support, to turn into death traps. Break traditionThe Easter break is traditionally a time for worship and for friends and familiesto come together.A time when children enjoy Easter Egg hunts and many head for the country or coast. With good weather in many parts, the temptation to break the lockdown restrictions will be strong. But we urge you to stay home.

Cardf mum Sue Martin spoke to the BBCaposs Today programme about the fateful call from doctors telling her that her husband was being put on a ventilator, and the shell-shocked family needed to say goodbye.Sue described her -year-old husband Mal Martin as fit and healthy. But the devastated family has been told he has aposzero chanceapos of survival. The mum gave an emotional interview recounting the familyaposs final phone call, and a ten-minute visit behind screens around Malaposs hospital bed. Her description of the moment she and the coupleaposs two children, aged  and , stood behind screens around a sleeping Malaposs bedside to say their goodbyes moved listeners to tears. The family was allowed to go into hospital in full protective wear for what is likely to be the last time they are all together. Malaposs we and children could not even touch him to say farewell as they stood around his bedside at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend. Sue recalled: We just told him that we loved him. It was heartbreaking to hear the children tell him that they were going to make him proud. The family have been left to prepare for the beloved husband and fatheraposs death as he lies in intensive care on the brink of organ failure. Despite being told there was no way he would pull through, Sue says the family is living in hope of a miracle.According to the Independent, Mal is chairman of a recruitment firm and Sue is a communications manager at the Department for Transport, and the couple have been together for  years.Mal has Type  diabetes and had suffered a heart attack four years ago, but had lived a very, very healthy le, his we told the Today programme.   Sue said Mal first began feeling unwell with cold-like symptoms on March , and his condition got progressively worse. After about a week, his condition declined so badly he could not get out of bed. Sue told the Independent Mal had a persistent cough, a headache and a temperature of .C. She added in the BBC interview: The cough was the worse thing for him. It was like nothing  Iaposve heard before. aposI wish we had been able to give him a hugapos Mal began self-isolating to keep the rest of his family safe as soon as he began feeling unwell. But when his condition did not improve after another week, Sue said she tried to seek medical advice. However she claimed she struggled to get through on attempts to call NHS  services, saying she kept being put on hold for more than an hour each time then was cut off. She then rang a doctor at the local surgery, who encouraged her to keep a record of Malaposs symptoms and check on him every second hour throughout the days.  But Malaposs symptoms went into sharp decline on March  and Sue said she stayed up all night anxiously checking his condition. At this stage his breathing rate was normal, and the doctor seemed satisfied by his condition and recommended he stay at home at that point. By the early hours of Sunday morning, ten days after he first began showing symptoms of coronavirus his condition was so poor, Sue called an ambulance. She described how his breathing had become rapid, and when the paramedics arrived she and the children were not allowed to go near him. As he was rushed to hospital, they had to say their goodbyes there and then, Sue recalled. She said: It was awful because I wish now that we had been able to give him a hug. She did not know that the worst was yet to come, explaining that the family believed once Mal was admitted to hospital his condition would improve. Sue said: I really thought that a couple of days on oxygen and heaposd be back home with us.  But within around an hour of Malaposs arrival at hospital, she received a call from the AE at the Princess of AE Hospital saying he had whisked straight to intensive careand put on a ventilator. Sue said a doctor told her Mal was very, very sick and the family needed to be prepared that he might not pull through. Sue told Today she never thought her husband would be among the patients fighting for their lives in hospital. She described being shocked to hear that he may not survive, after he had been able to walk out of the family home to a waiting ambulance.  Sue recalled: The nurse said that she had spoken to him and he was aware of what was going to happen to him, and that they were going to put him to sleep and put him on a ventilator to do the breathing for him because his body was very tired and extremely poorly. The last time the family saw each other Sue was surprised to learn that he would soon be unconscious, saying I think I just assumed that a ventilator was like another type of oxygen mask, I didnapost realise it involved him being put to sleep. The nurse told her that Mal had asked for her to call him as he was too upset after he was told he may not ever come off the ventilator. Sue and her children called him over FaceTime, where they saw him struggling to breathe and already wearing an oxygen mask. The family were in tears, realising this might be the last time they were all together again as they were forced to say their goodbyes to Mal.  Sue said: We just told him how much we loved him and I said how much I was really sorry that I hadnapost sent him in earlier... They said in hospital that Iaposd done everything that I could have. He promised he would fight it. She said her husband promised their children he would pull through and be there for him.  He said to my daughter who was , Donapost worry, Iaposm going to be around a while yet and be here for your wedding and for you both growing up and see William play rugby for Wales - heaposs . He was told thathe did recover it would take over a year. Mal texted the family, promising he wouldnapost leave them, Sue said. He said it wasnapost his time, that he missed me too much and that he was coming home. When the text messages ceased, they knew it was because he had been put on the ventilator in ICU. Saying goodbye through a hospital screen She said: That day really was when everything changed for us and we have just been existing since.  She said the hospital had been amazing, with a consultant ringing every day with an update. At first the doctors told the family Mal had   chance of survival. But the -year-old dad is strong, fit and healthy, Sue said. She said the family kept faith when doctors said they would do everything they could to help him. But after a few days on the ventilator, the doctors told her despite their best efforts they had been unable to take him off the ventilator. Then Malaposs kidneys failed, and he was put on dialysis. After that, Sue received the fateful call from the doctors informing the family there was aposalmost zero chanceapos Mal would survive. The doctors told her they were giving him the maximum adrenaline they could to keep the blood pumping to his vital organs. But he was on the brink, and they told Sue they didnapost think they could do anything more for him as it was likely his organs begin failing. Reeling from the news, she rang the hospital again and begged to be able to see her husband. A nurse told Suethe family could get to the hospital quickly, they could have  minutes with Mal and even stayed two hours after her sht to ensure they fulfilled their desperate wish. The nursing sister helped the family dress in full personal protective equipment . Sue said they were taken in to say goodbye to Mal: we werenapost allowed to touch him, but we could speak to him. Essentially we were going in to say our goodbyes. I said to the children... aposyou absolutely donapost have to do this, this is a personal choice, thereaposs no right or wrong. You have to do what you feel.apos But they both wanted very much to come and see him. because they hadnapost been able to really hug him before he left. The family were forced to say their final goodbyes to Mal through screens around his bed. Sue said the medics were wonderful and compassionate.  She recounted the awful scene as she and her children stood around his hospital bed, unable to touch him. It was just like he was asleep. he had so many tubes and obviously wires in him and everything - it was like he was fast asleep. We just told him really that we love him, and it was heartbreaking, really, to hear the childrenthey were going to make him proud. She added: It was very hard not being able to touch him but we were glad to get to see him. aposA little glimmer of hopeapos The family had expected he would not survive Monday, but have since been told his condition has been improved slightly.Doctors said Malaposs lungs and kidneys had failed, but they had noted a slight increase in his blood pressure and were able to reduce his adrenaline .Sue said the family had accepted this did not mean he would survive. She said there had been no improvement or deterioration by Wednesday. He is still extremely, desperately ill and thereaposs still almost zero chance of him pulling through. As the emotional interview came to a close, Sue said the family had not yet given up hope. Although everyday we prepare for the worst, thereaposs a little glimmer of just maybe, just maybe, he might turn a corner. Chances of survival after ventilation slim The latest report into patients admitted into critical care in the UK showed that of those who required ventilation so far, just under a third have survived. Figures for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, from the intensive care national audit , showed that as at Friday, April , of , patients for whom data was available,  had died.  Another  patients were discharged alive from critical care and , patients were last reported as still being in critical care. The NHS requires an estimated , ventilators to meet the demand predicted for the peak of the Covid- pandemic in the UK.

Now is the time we can start to see mammals and their newborns pop their heads above ground. Today Chris Packham and zoologist Megan McCubbin talk about their favourite British mammals to keep your eyes peeled for in April and May. Badgers  Badgers are active throughout the course of the year and would’ve given birth in February or March, so in the next couple of weeks the young might be coming above ground for the first time. But they’ve very shy. They live in setts in the middle of the large territory that belongs to the whole family. The main sett is where the badgers live for most of the year and where they rear their babies but they also have smaller setts which they use in the Spring, Summer and Autumn so they can sleep near to where they find food.  A family of badgers can have a really big territory - each badger terrirtory might have up to six smaller setts. They’re sociable animals and like living with each other and love to play. And they’re really good at knowing which territory is theirs by their latrines - badgers have really distinct smelling faeces which they put at the edge of their territories so other families know they shouldn’t enter. It’s quite a sophisticated set up and is essential to their survival. Bats  We have  species of bat in the UK,  of which are known to be breeding here - that’s almost a quarter of our mammal species. They’re emerging this time of year and you can see them in all areas - urban or rural. But bats are always betteryou’ve got water near you. Soyou’re near a pond, reservoir, anything like that, you’ll see they’re beginning to emerge regularly. Bat populations have suffered severe declines during the past century. Deer  We had a muntjac deer near us the other day. You can tell the dference between male and female because the males have two very distinctive dark lines down the forehead and have very short antlers. The females are slightly paler. Muntjac have these amazing curved bottoms like rabbits. They are quite pig like with very sticky legs and are one of my favourites. They’re not native to the UK and were brought here in  to Woburn Safari Park. Some of them escaped, which is why they’re quite common across woodlands in the south of England. They’re very shy and secretive animals, soyou get a glimpse make the most of it. They’re fascinating, you can see them on roadsides nibbling at the verges. But they aren’t too popular with gardeners because they go for all the tasty parts of your plants - they love rosebuds. Also just be waryyou’re out walking your dog in an area where they might be and keep your animal on a lead. Foxes  April is the time we would expect start to see our fox cubs and they start to move around out of their den. If people are lucky enough to have a den in their garden shed, this is when they’ll first see the fox cubs. They’re very unfoxy when you first see them, they have quite blunt faces with short ears. They look quite cat-like, like kittens the nose hasn’t grown down yet and they’re chocolate brown in colour, they’re not red yet. Wobbling about with their skinny tails, they try to find their balance. We’ve already had reports of that cubs have been sighted as early as Christmas and January. This is really early, which is a sign of climate change. Fellow Springwatch presenter, Iolo Williams, told me he saw very young fox cubs and that was just before or after Christmas. That’s quite unusual. Otters  Pre s, where a lot of chemicals were put into our waterways, many of them were devoid of le and it damaged the eco systems. Everything at the top of the food chain disappeared. Otters only really occurred on the western side of the UK, in Wales, Cornwall and Devon. When I was a kid in the s, otters were a rather rare animal they were dficult to see and it didn’t occur in Hampshire where I grew up. Now they have recovered their range and have been found in every UK county, all the way across from the west and now including Kent. But they have not recovered their numbers, so there’s still scope for more otters to exist in our environment, particularly now our waterways have been cleaned up. We can’t be complacent about otter conservation just because they’re back everywhere - they’re not back in numbers they were, but it’s great to see them turning up. In urban areas they have even been turning up and you can see them in daytime from footpaths. Otters were almost an enigma and now are mostly accessible. The Sainsbury’s supermarket in Andover has a path that runs alongside the river and while you’re pushing your trolley you can look over the side and see them. How to make a hedgehog house and highway  Hedgehogs are a favourite this time of year - everyone loves hedgehogs. It’s mild and now’s the time they’re coming out into the garden soyou have a trap camera, now is the time to set it up. You can also make a little hedgehog house which is really simple. Get a bucket, put some hay or straw, grass, any long organic matter, inside the bucket, just something the hedgehog can hide in.

Kind-hearted Brits have rushed to the page to help out the family and almost £, has been raised in less than  hours.

Today, Gemma added: It is amazing how much has been raised in the last  hours and it shows how much Kev and his family were liked and loved.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, standing in for the Prime Minister, urged restraint amid signs social-distancing was beginning to work.But with temperatures set to soar over the bank holiday, police warned they were ready to take action against those who flout the rules. One police chief even warned his force was only “a few days away” from imposing roadblocks. The Devon  Cornwall force also said it would be patrolling the M motorway on the Somerset and Devon border to keep tourists away from the area.Military Defence Police, based in Portsmouth and Plymouth, will be operating along the coastlines in Dorset, Devon and Cornall to ensure people aposdo not gather unnecessarilyapos, reported i news on Thursday evening. It comes as Boris Johnson was last night moved back to the ward at St Thomas’ Hospital in South London after his condition improved following three anxious nights in intensive care.A No spokesman said the PM “will receive close monitoring” and was “in extremely good spirits”. The PM’s fiancée Carrie Symonds broke her silence by tweeting multiple clapping hand emojis and a child’s painting of a rainbow, as the country applauded health workers at pm. Government officials are now confident that new coronavirus infections are starting to level off. But as Mr Johnson spent his fth night in hospital, Mr Raab said it was too soon to begin lting the measures brought in almost three weeks ago.  Saying the Government would not even begin re-assessing the lockdown until the end of next week, he urged the public to think “long and hard” about the impact on heroic NHS staffthey ignored the rules. “After all the efforts everybody has made, after all the sacrices so many people have made let’s not ruin it now,” Mr Raab said. “Let’s not undo the gains we’ve made, let’s not waste the sacrices so many people have made. We mustn’t give the coronavirus a second chance to kill more people and to hurt our country.” Apologising that people would not be able to spend time with their families over Easter he added: “The deaths are still rising. It’s too early to lt the measures that we put in place.”  Ministers launched a Stay at Home This Easter publicity drive designed to make sunseekers think twice.And stars from sport, and music backed the message. England and Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford, and Happy Mondays singer Shaun Ryder joined key workers to record clips for a video released by Greater Manchester Police yesterday.The warnings come as new figures showed the number of hospital patients who have died after testing positive rose  to ,. But the rate of new infections appears to have slowed and officials are confident lockdown is working. Sources say they now believe Brits with Covid- are infecting on average less than one person each. This is the crucial reproduction numberthreshold which,kept up, would see the outbreak die out. New daily confirmed cases fell to , yesterday, a signicant drop from , the previous day. This had been falling with , on Tuesday, , on Monday, down from the peak of , on Sunday. Lockdown began after modelling showed the reproduction number– or amount of people each carrier infects – was between  and ., meaning cases doubling every four or five days.  A source leading the response to the crisis said: “If the R goes below , the epidemic just dies out anyway, which is hopefully what’s happening. “If the R is somewhat above  you can control it with active measures.” Daily testing is now starting to be increased to around , after stalling near the , a day mark. But insiders say easing lockdown can only be consideredthe Government meets its ,-a-day target. Even then it can only happensocial distancing has been maintained and hospitals are well within capacity. But the focus is now moving move to a Government “exit strategy”, which it has repeatedly refused to outline.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer asked ministers to publish plans to get Britain out of the lockdown.He said: “I’m not calling for timings, but the strategy. We need to know plans are in place, and what they are.” Downing Street said police would have the “full support” of Government in enforcing the coronavirus lockdown at this “critical juncture”.

Emmie splurged a whopping £ on food - much of which was perishable and has now gone off - leaving her with no choice but to dump it. The stockpiling mum says she now spends £ a week on shopping - and throws away around % of what she spends. Despite this, Emmie says she feels no guilt in throwing away food while others maybe going without. She said: I understand the criticism about food not being left for vulnerable people and key workers, but I donapost feel bad - itaposs supermarketsapos responsibility to order more and make sure they have enough stock in. Now, as Easter approaches, single mum Emmie said she will continue to stockpile, despite numerous heartbreaking stories of the elderly and the most vulnerable being left without any food.  Emmie said she plans on buying more chocolate, biscuits and treats for her three children because now more than ever she wants to spoil them. Speaking about her hoarding , Emmie said she was terried at what was to come, so packed her fridge with groceries, including lots of fruit, veg, biscuits, eggs, tinned food, pasta and  toilet rolls. Emmie revealed however that many of the toilet rolls were also binned as they accidentally got wet from the shower. The mum, speaking to Fabulous magazine, said she felt like she had been plunged into a disaster movie and was forced to think of what her children would and wouldnapost eat during the lockdown.When her children refused to eat some of the food she had stockpiled, Emmie said she needed to make room for things they did like.

The -year-old south Londoner then died last Friday in intensive care.Brother Yasser told the Daily Mail that Ayub, of Norwood, was struggling to breathe and he could hear his painful coughing during the night.For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here Within days of picking up the woman in his Prius he felt cold and couldnapost stop coughing before an ambulance was called when his condition deteriorated. Ayubaposs brother, Yasser, said he developed coronavirus symptoms shortly after picking up the coughing passenger. He was taken to Mayday Hospital in Croydon before being moved to St Georgeaposs Hospital, Tooting, where he messaged his family to tell them he was really scared and to pray for him. His family were unable to be at his bedside when he died a few days later due to how infectious the disease is.  Yasser said they knew he was seriously ill because he would take a day to respond to any messages while in ITU. Doctors were asking him to breathe with his lungs but it became impossible, he added. It has all happened so quick. It destroyed him, he said, holding back tears. Yasser went on to say the family has not seen his brother yet and they donapost know when the funeral will be, with burials usually done within a day or two in their religion. It is believed there are several taxi drivers seriously ill with Covid symptoms. The Chair of United Private Hire Drivers, James Farrar is seeking a Judicial Review to examine whether London Taxi Drivers are properly protected. He is concerned many more may have been infected because of inadequate protection.Ayub and Yasser helped found a local UPHD branch and gave himself to help others and to build our movement for change, according to a Gofundme page set up in his honour.Together with Yasser, he  bravely challenged  the terrible injustices of our industry.  He stood against discrimination, fought to end exploitation and worked tirelessly so that drivers might have a better le.

Shocking images taken from a drone show workers using ladders to climb into a huge pit on Hart Island, off the Bronx. The area has been used for mass burials for those who have no next-of-kin, or whose families canapost afford funerals, for the past  years. Typically, some  bodies are interred each week by low-paid jail inmates working on the island, which is accessible only by boat.

For context, New York stateaposs population is just under a third of that of the UK at about  million. There are about two dozen bodies a day, five days a week buried on the island, said Jason Kersten, a spokesman for the Department of Correction, which oversees the burials. Before burial, the dead are wrapped in body bags and placed inside pine caskets. The deceasedaposs name is scrawled in large letters on each casket, which helps should a body need to be disinterred later.  They are buried in long narrow trenches excavated by digging machines.  They added two new trenches in case we need them, Mr Kersten said. To help with the surge contract laborers have been hired, he said. For social distancing and safety reasons, city-sentenced people in custody are not assisting in burials for the duration of the pandemic, Mr Kersten said. A barge could be seen arriving at the island on Thursday morning with a refrigerated truck aboard containing about two dozen bodies.  The department referred questions about causes of death to the cityaposs Office of the Chief Medical Examiner . The island may also be used as a site for temporary interments should deaths surge past the cityaposs morgue capacity, a point that has not yet been reached, Mr Kersten said. U.S. deaths due to coronavirus topped , on Thursday, according to a Reuters tally, although there are signs the outbreak might be nearing a peak.

It would be our intention,the season is brought to an early conclusion, where practical, to reimburse those season ticket holders for the remainder of the season that was not played.  This will be further assessed for timelines, etc., as we make our way through the claims process. We have often said that the club is a family and that remains true throughout this situation.In addition to our insurance coverage, we have also sought to access ious sources of support offered by the League, the Association, Government agencies and our associates.  All that have been involved have been extremely helpful in our solidication of the club as a business.  I would like to personally thank John Bennett for his very generous and selfless gesture of suspending rent on the stadium. His call, on day one of this crisis helped to set the tone for all that followed throughout this shutdown and is the epitome of showing how we are all in this together.The UK Government and its agencies have also been extremely helpful in the offering of grants loans and providing relief through the Job Retention Scheme.  That includes HMRC. It is our experience, thus far, that this country’s handling of the crisis exceeds others in the mitigation of losses for businesses as well as iniduals.  In the coming days we will be implementing elements of the job retention scheme in respect of our staff and it is our intention that all are looked after fully throughout this crisis. This includes our football players, football staff and administrative staff receiving full pay while they are on furlough for the foreseeable future.We also think it is right to give credit to the dedicated workers at the SPFL and SFA. They have been working in an ever-changing landscape throughout this unprecedented event. They have continued to keep us informed and provide us advice on how to best navigate this predicament. They have freely shared the advice and guidance they are receiving from the government and UEFA as we all feel our way through these weeks. We continue to take advice and express our opinions on what football should look like when football resumes. Although none of us know yet what will transpire with this season, it is clear that football will be back.We’ve been inundated with requests on how people can help the club.  It’s truly been heart-warming. The one way to helpyou can – and onlyyou can # is to purchase season tickets and merchandise online.  We still have limited availability of this year’s Third Strip, which may become a collector’s item as it may never be worn.This supports the club as well as SSAFA and The Black Watch Association charities.  We will soon be launching our - kit in the upcoming days and we know it’s not enough to completely fill your appetite for football, but keep an eye on the social media sites for Dundee FC and DFC in the Community, which will provide some entertainment while we all do our part to save lives by staying home.We wish we had something more definitive to say, but we hope this brief update will provide some reassurance that we are still here and will remain here when this crisis is over.

Riverside was a shock for them on a December morning and certainly not what a guy like Caniggia was used to!“Caniggia, Ravanelli, Ketsbaia, all the top names that came into the club were brand new. They were great lads, they really were.“It was a bit surreal training against these boys. I was a bit stand-offish because I had a reputation of being a little rash and I wasn’t going to smash Caniggia in training!“He was just left to do his thing and you gave him the respect he deserves.“He basically got to do whatever he wanted around the club. Nobody was going to tell Caniggia he couldn’t do something!“We’d be at training and his five-year-old son would be up with us. We’d be doing a shooting exercise and running out of balls because Caniggia’s son had six at the side kicking them about!”Wilkie also revealed Caniggia’s free reign didn’t stop there and the Argentine was known to enjoy a pre-match cigarette in the Dens Park dressing room.He said: “We had the one cubicle in the changing-room and I used to like my pre-match toilet to just chill out and read the programme to get my mind ready for the game.“I’d always have to wait on Caniggia coming out the toilet because he’d be in there smoking a rolly-up.“He used to just come out with a wee smile on his face, shrug his shoulders and walk past you but that was just the kind of guy he was.“The Italians and the Argentines were horried the British boys would drink beer but they would smoke asit was the healthiest thing going.“They were really fit, though. Caniggia was probably the fittest guy I played with and fans could see that when he scored his first goal against Aberdeen and took his top off.“He was so strong for his age and looked after himself really well.“He was one of the biggest players in the world and it was amazing he was at Dundee.”It was a crucial time in Wilkie’s career but bust-ups with the Bonettis led to him going on loan to Plymouth Argyle, Notts County and Falkirk.But he found his way back to Dens, impressing then-Scotland manager Berti Vogts enough to get a call-up to the national team.“It was dficult for me because I was young and fiery and they were exactly the same,” Wilkie said of clashing with the Bonettis.“I had a couple of fall-outs with them that really came from nothing. It’s disappointing how it ended up because I really quite liked them.“Dario really knew his stuff as a coach and, as an ex-defender, he used to take us away to do bits and pieces in training.“I really enjoyed that. The two times I fell out with them were from silly little things in training that shouldn’t have happened.“My loan moves then came from the fall-outs but I got called back from Falkirk because they’d fallen out with Marco De Marchi and Fan Zhiyi.“When I was on loan at Notts County I’d pretty much given up. I was close to deciding I was done with football because I was fed up.“I was in a bad place. I got injured down there in my first or second game, sat stuck in a hotel and I thought that was me done.“I was only  so I was just a bit naive and immature I guess.

That goes for the clubs, too.That’s why I’m not surprised both the Dark Blues and the Tangerines have opted to use the government’s furlough scheme – they are businesses and they have to do what is right to ensure they stay afloat during this time when there’s no income.Like a lot of people in the city right now, that will bring a whole lot of worry to workers for what the future holds post-coronavirus.Not knowing where the next wage is coming from is a dreadful situation to be in.There are players at both clubs whose contracts end in a couple of months and they have my every sympathy.I’ve been through similar in my playing career and that uncertainty is probably the worst feeling you can have as a professional.Going through administration at Dundee was a dferent sort of situation but I ended up coming out of it with that question of how I was going to pay my bills.Back then I was prepared to take a wage cut to help the club but it was decided that wouldn’t be enough and I left Dens Park.EXCLUSIVE: Lee Wilkie on starring alongside Claudio Caniggia at Dundee, Argentina star#s unusual pre-match ritual and representing Scotland\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-claudio-caniggia-dundee-fc-scotland embed #

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg.

Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch. Letrsquos share our experiences, and understand that while we may be isolating, we are not alone."},{"url":null,"title":"european-stone-stacking-championships-dunbar-postponed","story":"The European Stone Stacking Championships were due to take place between April  and , with a place at the World Rock Stacking Championships in Texas next year up for grabs.However, James Craig Page, creator and director of the festival, broke the news that the event, like dozens of others across the county, had to be postponed amid concerns surrounding coronavirus.Mr Page said: ldquoIt has been postponed but we are very hopeful that we will find another venue or be able to go ahead at a dferent time.ldquoHowever, for the time being we have to postpone.This year would have marked the fth year a stone stacking event had taken place in Dunbar event.Each year, it attracts thousands of people to the area, as well as competitors from throughout Europe.Mr Page spoke to the Courier upon ing from the World Rock Stacking Championships in the USA last month.Initially, he was keen to see the European event, which takes place at Eye Cave Beach, off Bayswell Road, take place.However, upon ing to British shores, he became aware of the state of the global issue.Speaking to the Courier, he said: ldquoWe were just waiting for word and advice but it became apparent when I got back how bad things were and that we needed to put it on hold.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be taking any risks with anybodyrsquos health and wellbeing.

That might actually be the case with Mr Johnson, since hersquos been under immense pressure over the past year: replacing Theresa May, renegotiating Brexit, then fighting a General Election.So, no one should be under any illusion that hersquoll be able tonormally any time soon. This raises dficult questions. Who in his Cabinet will have the authority to tell him that he canrsquot be allowed to take key decisions while his faculties are impaired Who exactly is in charge  The First Secretary, Dominic Raab, is formally chairing Cabinet committees. But that begs the question of who takes the final decisions. Where does the buck stop Someone has to balance the competing demands of the two front-line Cabinet ministers, Matt Hancock and Rishi Sunak. They have very dferent constituencies of interests. Mr Hancock is all about saving the NHS and avoiding immediate deaths Mr Sunak is about saving the economy, upon which just as many lives could ultimately depend.Who decides whether and for how long to renew the lockdown on Monday  It will almost certainly be continued, but should there be a provisional timetable for lting aspects of it, following Austria and Denmark Research led by Professor Russell Viner for University College London appears to show that keeping schools closed is of little use in halting the spread of coronavirus. Yet it damages the educational prospects of less-well-off children. Others disagree, including, it seems, Professor Neil Ferguson of the celebrated Imperial College report that prompted the lockdown last month.The minor scandal of the Scottish Chief Medical Officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, breaking her own stay-at-home guidelines underlines the problem of compliance. For the comfortable middle classes, with gardens and nice homes, lockdown is tolerable but working-class families in small flats may find it unbearable.Then again, should the UK be encouraging the wearing of masks  Countries like Austria and Slovakia have made them compulsory. America is adopting masks on the grounds that it slows the spread of the disease. But the advice here is still that theyrsquore of little use.A broader question now there is a new Labour leader, is a government of national unity. Keir Starmer has clearly ordered his new shadow cabinet members to stop saying ldquowe were right and start talking constructively about how to revive a moribund economy when the lockdown is over.The Opposition has a crucial role to play in getting the Government to focus and be clear about what it is doing. But should there be a more formal arrangement, as in the Second World War when the then Labour leader Clement Attlee, was made Deputy Prime Minister It would mean the Opposition is bound by collective responsibility, and has to endorse the decisions made by Government in the next few weeks. On the other hand it would greatly enhance the political profile of the new Labour leader, and could provide a  on which Sir Keir could build a winning election campaign, in the way Attlee won the post-war General Election in .These are decisions that only a Prime Minister can make, for the simple reason that he will be required to accept the consequences. This is a desperate time for him and the country, as the death toll continues to rise.As I write, it seems that the PMrsquos condition is stable. Twitter aside, there has been a considerable degree of public sympathy for Mr Johnson. No one can be in any doubt that he feels our pain. The Prime Minister is, as it were, the first casualty among equals.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Shops across Scotland are closing.

The wording is apparently so ldquocack-handed ndash the charityrsquos phrase ndash that recipients are misinterpreting it to mean they will not receive any medical helpthey contract the virus.This is not what the letter says, but it would be an easy mistake to make. Evenit were clear, it would still be upsetting. Signing a DNAR is almost as sure an indication that the end of the line is fast approaching as requesting the last rites. Often it is signed by those with power of attorney for elderly relatives who are no longer of sound mind. Brutal though it looks when expressed in cold print, the intention behind it is compassionate.At a certain stage of ill-health, the process of resuscitation can be harsh. It unnecessarily prolongs suffering rather than allowing someone who has suffered a cardiac arrest to slip away peacefully. In some circumstances, especially where the patient is extremely frail, resuscitation is the worst of all options. Hard though it is to accept, the prospect of death can come as a relief to some for whom there is no hope of recovery, and who are simply longing to be gone.But for many who received this bald DNAR request, that is not the case. Instead of being asked to speed up and simply medical bureaucracy, they needed reassurance that, should they fall ill with Covid , they will be treated like anyone . The only grey area is over what they wish done in the event they require resuscitation. In their thoughtless and insensitive mail-shot, doctors presumably have pre-selected those for whom they think a DNAR is in their best interests. But what a way to go about it. It brings to mind Treasure Island and the sinister Black Spot pressed into piratesrsquo hands, signying their imminent demise.Even worse is the case of a care home where some residents, who were mentally well, learned staff had signed these forms on their behalf. I would not wish to be the manager should anyonersquos otherwise robust existence end prematurely because of a legally binding instruction they knew nothing about.What all this points to is troubling. There has been much trumpeting about the ways in which communities are pulling together under lockdown, growing stronger and kinder because of the strain on those who are least able to help themselves. Despite this, however, there is an insidious undercurrent to some discussions, a faint suggestion that the aged are in danger of being perceived as a nuisance, a drain on limited resources that are better used for the young. The tenor of recent government guidelines appears to hint that when people reach a certain vintage they should expect less heroic or interventionary treatment, and accept thatthings take a turn for the worst, their time is up.When new guidance was issued to medics by the former Chief Medical Officer Catherine Calderwood last week, Dr Donald Macaskill, chief executive of Care Scotland, was perturbed at its implications: ldquoNothing in this document gives me confidence that we will not be putting our clinicians in a position where they have no option but to decide on the basis of age.Le-saving equipment and highly trained medical staff are undoubtedly in limited supply. When intensive care beds and ventilators have to be rationed, then the decision of who benefits most will have to be made. Who would envy a doctor faced with such a bleak choice But it would be a terrible indictment of our societythe exigencies of this emergency fostered the sense that old is synonymous with surplus. If the word ldquopensioner is in danger of becoming a le-threatening label the long-term legacy of this disease will be far worse than the number of fatalities. It will have buried one of the primary principles on which modern civilisation is based.The idea that iniduals automatically become obsolescent after a certain age is repugnant. So too that their worth diminishes with each year. Who has the authority or right to say that one personrsquos le is more valuable than another  The more I see of friends in their eighties and nineties, the more I understand the old joke: Who would want to live to   Someone who is .One of the reasons this pandemic is so intense is because we have long recognised the importance of seniors. Modern medical advances have been expressly designed to allow much of the population to reach and enjoy advanced age, eventhey do rattle occasionally with their daily regimen of pills.Before going to university I worked for a year as an auxiliary nurse in a small hospital, on the male and female geriatric wards. It was a revelatory experience. Some of the patients had dementia, a few were permanently bed-bound, but there was not one of them who could not find some enjoyment and pleasure each day, or who did not retain much of their personality. It was an inspirational lesson that one of the finest achievements of society is to take such loving care of those whose best years are behind them, and for whom the future is measured in months, weeks, or simply hours.It is not for the state to determine who lives and dies. Every day doctors quietly make these calls, for reasons of humanity, and we must trust their judgement. When they need to discuss matters of le and death with relatively healthy patients, however, they would do well to remember that up to the very end, we all will rage against the dying of the light, and rightly, properly so.Shops across Scotland are closing.

However, a cause for hope is that the daily infection rate appears to be slowing, suggesting the attempt at flattening the curve of infection is working thanks to the public observing the Governmentrsquos instructions on self-isolation and social distancing.Yet the restrictions face their toughest test so far over the Easter weekend. Temperatures in some parts of the country are set to reach a balmy C, threatening to tempt more people to break the stay-at-home rules.The UK Government is expected to launch a media blitz in the next  hours to urge people to stick to its instructions and not allow the progress made thus far to be set back. The issue of the Easter lockdown is expected to dominate this afternoonrsquos daily Downing St press conference.Oliver Dowden, the Culture Secretary, took to the airwaves this morning to urge the public not to give up on the measures during the test of the long weekend as he predicted they would not be eased next week.\"I dont think its very likely these measures are going to be changed given theyre just starting to have an effect but, as we said, we would review them,\" he told BBC News.\"Its only prudent that on an ongoing basis we review them after three weeks,\" the Secretary of State explained.He went on: \"We are beginning to make progress on this, weve not seen the acceleration you would have expected had we not introduced this, the curve is beginning to flatten. This is the moment that we need to stick to the path weve chosen.\"The British people have really come behind this, we shouldnt be giving up this Easter weekend, that is the number one thing.\"Mr Dowden insisted the reason to hold off on making the decision until next week was because they were following the \"proper process\" and not because ministers were waiting for theof the Prime Minister, who he described as doing \"reasonably well\" in a stable condition. Last night, Mr Johnson was said to be improving and was sitting up bed ldquoengaging positively with his doctors.The Welsh Government has already announced an extension of lockdown measures. Vaughan Gething, the Welsh Health Minister, insisted there was \"virtually zero prospect\" of experts advising that UK-wide measures could be eased yet he said they would remain in place for \"a number of weeks\".Ms Sturgeon echoed the sentiment, telling Sky News: ldquoI dont think there is any possibility, any likelihood of these lockdown measures being lted immediately or even imminently.\"We dont yet really have enough data from what has happened so far to know for sure the impact they are having and, of course, we continue to see the number of deaths from coronavirus rising,\" added the First Minister.And in a sign that the police are poised to take an even tougher approach to those who disregard the Governmentrsquos instructions, Nick Adderley, the Chief Constable of Northamptonshire, made clear his force would now ramp up the enforcement of coronavirus regulations.He emphasised how the \"three-week grace period is over\" and people in the county could now face fines or a criminal record.Mr Adderley noted how a small number of people had been flouting the regulations with some having ldquobaited officers.He said the force could have to resort to more extreme measures such as road blocks and searching shopping trolleys should people continue to break the rules.\"These are not guidelines anymore. This is the law, declared the police chief.\"We havent issued any fixed penalty notices but we have charged a number of people with Covid-related offences.

Its website adds: ldquoPlease leave any unwanted items safely on your own property such as your back garden or your back court and remain mindful of any fire risk.All household waste recycling centres are closed until further notice.Edinburgh has also suspended the collection of bulky waste, and advises residents: ldquoIf you have large items please keep them at home and only use communal and wheelie bins for your day to day waste and recycling.The cityrsquos recycling centres are also closed until further notice.Mavis Valley Recycling Centre in East Dunbartonshire has been closed since March , while household waste recycling centres in West Lothian were shut on the same date.In West Dunbartonshire, the recycling centres at Ferry Road and Dalmoak are closed until further notice.Similar measures have been put in place at councils up and down the country.Mark Ruskell MSP, the Scottish Greensrsquo farming spokesman, said flytippers are putting others at risk.He said: ldquoFlytipping is illegal and dangerous at any time, but at a time of national emergency it is a downright disgrace.

Its other uses in a similar vein include the likes of ldquothe good book for the Bible or ldquogood tide at Christmas.Was Christ crucied on a Friday The day of the week was not mentioned in the Bible and there has been speculation it may have taken place earlier in the week, due to a Gospel reading from Matthew which says Christ would be dead for ldquothree days and three nights. As it is believed the resurrection took place on a Sunday, then this might mean the crucixion took place on a Wednesday or Thursday.It was not always observed The question of whether and when to mark the crucixion was a controversial issue in early Christianity and until the fourth century, the Last Supper, death and resurrection were observed in one commemoration the evening before Easter. From then on, they were marked separately.How is it marked Many denominations, including the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran and Anglican churches, observe Good Friday with fasting and church services, while countries around the world have their own traditions, ranging from flying kites to reenactments.Kites In Bermuda, residents make and fly their own kites to symbolise the ascension of Christ to heaven, before indulging in a feast of cod fishcakes and hot cross buns. Good Friday parties are usually held, with kites flying over picnics islandwide and even \"repair areas\" set up in parks, with tissue paper, glue and tape to patch up any kite damage.Re-enactments They take place around the world, including in the Mexico City borough of Iztapalapa, where , actors re-enact Christrsquos walk to his death. One man then plays the role of Jesus and wearing a crown of thorns, he is flogged in the streets while carrying a -pound cross.Jerusalem Carrying wooden crosses and singing hymns, thousands of Christians take part in a procession through the Old City of Jerusalem, retracing the steps Christ is believed to have taken carrying his cross to his crucixion.And in the Philippines In Pampanga, between three and  men are physically nailed to a cross each Good Friday to recreate the crucixion.Why does the date change The date for Good Friday dfers annually as Easter is determined by the moon - it falls on the first Sunday following the paschal full moon, which is the first full moon after the spring equinox, thought to have been determined by clerics in the middle ages.This year The  observance will be vastly dferent, of course, with places of worship closed and most of us restricted to our own homes amid lockdown.MAUREEN SUGDEN"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-pot-luck","story":"A FRIEND of Milngacie reader Robin Gilmour owns an antiques shop in Newport Pagnell.

Using a scientic technique called genotype imputation, the researchers have developed a lower-cost method that could make the process feasible for more breeders and producers.The approach uses a smaller number of genetic marers to predict the resistance of salmon to sea lice. This looks for iations at specic positions in the genes of fish that indicate how it will respond to parasites and disease.The information then allows breeders to select parent fish with improved resistance to sea lice.Similar techniques have been used successfully in livestock breeding programmes and could be effective in other aquaculture species, including shrimp and tilapia.The process could also be used as a preventative measure to improve other important health traits, suchas resistance to gill disease.Meanwhile, gill disorders can be caused by the growth of micro-organisms in the water such as plankton and algae.The researchers worked in collaboration with Hendrix Genetics and the University of Stirling s Institute of Aquaculture as part of a project supported by the Scottish Aquaculture Innovation Centre .Professor Ross Houston, chairmanof aquaculture genetics at the Roslin Institute, said: \"Sea lice is one of the costliest health-related problems forthe global salmon industry and can have a wide-scale impact on salmon health and welfare. In this study we used low density genetic markers to predict the resistance of salmon to sea lice. This is potentially a more cost-efficient way of breeding salmon with improved resistance to parasites and other diseases, helping to improve animal welfare and production.\"Scotland has more than  salmon farms, which produce , tons of fish a year. Concerns about the scale of sea lice problems recently prompted the introduction of new rules that require the farmed salmon industry to report weekly levels of sea lice.The Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation, however, has maintained farm operators have made progress in the fight against sea lice, with levels recently said to be at their lowest in six years.The industry has introduced a range of counter meamsures aimed at preventing and controlling lice infestations, including hydrolicers and thermolicers, which use water rather than chemicals in medicines to clear affected fish.Net pens with skirts, semi-closed containment systems that prevent lice copepodites from finding salmon and ldquocleaner fish that eat the lice from infected salmon have also been used, while some researchers are working on lice vaccines.Caroline Grfin, aquaculture innovation manager at SAIC, said: ldquoCollaborative research projects are crucial for finding new methods for enhancing fish health and wellbeing, while also supporting the future sustainability of the industry.ldquoSea lice continues to be a prominent challenge for the sector worldwide and developing cost-effective, data-led techniques for future breeding could transform the ways in which we manage and treat sea lice on fish farms."},{"url":null,"title":"uzma-mir-playing-happy-families-lockdown-no-neither","story":"By a weird quirk of fate, lockdown sees me living with my recently-ed-from-London younger brother. This, I can report, is providing endless reams of material for that sitcom I may yet write.Every day I am finding out or rediscovering aspects of his personality and character. He was despatched to university in London in . Once he graduated he took a succession of corporate jobs, always too busy to visit the homeland. Similarly, after I graduated I threw myself in my career, too. Wersquove always got on, but face to face time over the years has been limited.Le before lockdown was good for me. As a working single parent, I had waved goodbye to little kids, had a great two-day a week job that fascinated and challenged me and was selfishly enjoying the single le. I had joined a gym, had a perfectly clean and tidy house, reconnected with old friends, travelled to new places and was enjoying clubbing again, and maybe even thinking about finding that perfect man.Suddenly came lockdown and my -year-old brother came with it ndash all ft in of him in a tiny house made for small folk, alongside my hulking teenager, no stranger to the upper end of the measuring tape either.This was a jolt to the system. And it has been for the last two long weeks. The actual swishing puddles on the bathroom floor alert me to the fact hersquos had a shower, the sticky handles on the fridge tell me hersquos put honey on his cereal, then gone to the fridge to get the milk, and the sudden increase in Marks  Spencers reduced items ndash some  at the last count ndash remind me of the fact my wee bro is in the house.The boy who always loved a bargain has become the man who will buy large chocolate Swiss rolls, and sticky toffee puddings, four of them, for p each, without thinking how three of us are going to eat them all in the six hours before they go out of date.Instead they are met with a steely glare from me, on my perpetual diet, and the hardened stare of his -year-old nephew who has taken to examining all the food in the fridge declaring it lsquofit or unfitrsquo for consumption.ldquoYour brother is the actual antithesis of me, he informs me officiously. ldquoIf I see reduced stickers I think steer clearrsquo, but your brother takes a perverse pleasure in snapping these up!

Itrsquos like we are back in our semi in one of Glasgowrsquos suburbs where I used to protect him from the ice-cream van man who told him to ldquobugger off and not come back apparently because he was taking too long to decide what sweets he wanted to buy. .My role, once again, is to shield him, this time from an invisible menace ndash coronavirus. But hersquos taken the childlike thing too far. Suddenly he canrsquot make his own bed, fold his towel properly or wash and iron his clothes.

Where do you feel the anxiety  Be conscious of what your body is telling you. Is your heart racing, stomach churning  To help ease these symptoms, be mindful of your breathing. Inhale through your nose for  slowly and exhale through your mouth again counting to  slowly. Repeat this exercise four times.AwarenessWe cannot control how her lersquos have changed due to this pandemic but what we can control is our thoughts to this global crisis. To quote from the Greek philosopher Epictetus ldquoPeople are not disturbed not by things, but by the views they take of them. Through awareness of how our thoughts make us feel, we can challenge these to more positive helpful thoughts. Awareness is the key to unlocking our distorted thoughts and through recognising whether we are for example predicting, judging or catastrophising, this can assist us in challenging and changing these negative obtrusive thoughts to more positive helpful ones.Self-CareTake this time as an opportunity to look after self. Self-care is crucial for building up resilience to le events and there is no time more important than in the now to engage in self-care: it is a priority. Self-care consists of several elements:Physical self-care such as nutrition, exercise and sleep.Mental self-care such as being aware of our thoughts and behaviours and engaging in activities such as crosswords. Emotional Self-care such as being aware of our emotions for example anger and sadness and how these can be managed. For example, through keeping a daily journal to recognise the triggers for our emotions.Spiritual Self-care such as awareness of when our minds are racing with thoughts and to try and be still. Engage in activities such as meditation, mindfulness and through being still in the now this will quieten the racing mind and provide strength at this challenging time. Take time to assess your self-care by implementing a self-care plan and commence small steps to change through looking after self. ldquoAn empty lantern provides no light. Self-care is the fuel that allows your light to shine brightly. If you find yourself struggling with anxiety, low mood or lapsing into unhelpful ways of coping, then contact Sharon.

Situated on the banks of the River Teviot, in an award-winning conversion of the former Victorian electrical works, the distillery is laying down spirit for a future Single Malt release, makes an excellent gin, and recently released a vodka.Kerrrsquos Borders Gin is genuinely Scottish Gin ndash wholly distilled from barley grown within  miles of the distillery. It is named after William Kerr ndash Hawick-born, and among the th centuryrsquos most accomplished botanists. He sent  plant specimens back to Kew Gardens from his Far East travels.Kerr would likely have approved of the distilleryrsquos Carterhead Still ndash one of only a handful in operation. It gently heats the botanicals rather than boiling them like most other gin stills, capturing more of the subtle flavours. Together with the barley, this gives the gin a distinctive depth. The rounded flavour works well with the bitterness of tonic water, creating a beautully balanced GT.The newest addition to distilleryrsquos range is Puffing Billy Steam Vodka ndash unfiltered malted barley vodka, named after the special still which plays a key role in its production. The spirit is steamed through charcoal inside the still itself and never filtered as a liquid, preserving the delicious character of the barley.Itrsquos the only vodka in the world made this way, and drinks commentators have praised the result, suggesting it could reinvigorate vodka, a spirit somewhat overlooked during the recent gin boom. Fabulous with tonic or Ginger Beer, the vodka also tastes incredibly smooth sipped chilled and straight.Kerrrsquos Borders Gin and Puffing Billy Steam Vodka are available direct from the distilleryrsquos online shop, currently offering free delivery anywhere within the UK when you buy a bottle.See www.thebordersdistillery shop ------------------------------------------------The Mortgage Advice Service ScotlandRe-mortgaging During the Coronavirus OutbreakAlthough health concerns are their immediate priority, people are searching for ways to reduce their monthly expenditure and cutting their biggest monthly outlay makes financial sense.Although the Coronavirusis having a signicant impact on obtaining funds for purchasing a new home, re-mortgages are still available from lenders at competitive rates and depending on the size of your mortgage, you could make substantial savings each month by simply changing lenders.Re-mortgaging neednt be a hassleEvenyou can save hundreds of pounds by shopping around, the thought of trying to switch your current mortgage may seem like a hassle you could do without.However, re-mortgaging isnt nearly as much hassle as you may think, because, thats where we step in and do all the work that is involved in finding you a fresh deal that can lower your monthly payments and maybe even help you to pay off your mortgage quicker.Choosing the right mortgage can be tricky.Next to purchasing your home, choosing the right mortgage is probably one of the most important decisions you will make when you are looking for a new deal.Approaching your current lender or bank may not result in you obtaining the best mortgage deal because they generally only consider their own products.

Our current social security system is overly complicated, and actively discourages work because the loss of benefits when a person starts work can often leave them losing money.ldquoOur national economic recovery must begin with a clear signal that work always pays.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3068065.jpg--.jpg?1586335198000\n","title":"get your free sunflower seeds and help brighten borough","story":"Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is asking residents to help brighten up the Ballymena area, by delivering free packets of sunflower seeds to local shops.These will be free to customers for the annual sunflower competition.They are asking residents to grow their sunflowers in their garden and post their progress online with the winners being announced in September.A spokesperson for the Council, said: “Being outside in your garden is a very good thing to do especially in these challenging days.

Businesses, places of worship, schools, restaurants and pubs are all closed sad, yes, but the cumulative effect of the lockdown is the peace it has brought in homes. vw, px\"  TAILOR-MADE: Absence makes the heart grow fonder # Elly OdhiamboThat is my experience: fewer silly arguments about whose turn it to wash the dishes and get the food ready for the household. The shutdown is magical albeit an emotionally draining one. I had to talk to my landlord from across the street so that we don’t infect each other with this virus that has caused the shutdown. I have heard of families avoiding each other within the house in order to stay clean of the dreaded disease.The shutdown is non-discriminatory because its basic effects to you and me will probably be equal. It does not target this or that race, gender, height measurement and so forth, we have seen reports that little children ill with the disease are dying. So people need to stay home.Thee other day I was thinking about back home, Kenya – the dferent urban and rural settings where I grew up and the things that I am missing. For example, a slimy vegetable called apoth. This vegetable is heaven on earth especially after it has been left in the pot matured for days with some milk. You will regret ever becoming a fan of meat. So once you’ve cooked your ring aliya, a special sun-dried beef, and got your four-stars chilli pepper, you get your maize flour ugali meal ready. These are some of the things we miss.MISSING IN ACTIONThe plan was to fly back home this summer after being missing in action there since . Shock, horror! Not really, because I know of people who sadly haven’t been home for a very y period of time. A Zimbabwean told me seventeen years and counting.Eleven siblings meeting under one roof has never happened in our household since around the same time the Cold War ended in , or thereabouts. This was without a doubt the last time I saw all eleven of us packed in one room in the small lakeside town of Homa Bay. Our mother was a tailor, still is at the age of . She had the natural talent for making women’s cloths only. If she was going to cross that line and do outfits for males, it was for boys – her children. Her shop sounded elitist, Mama Vicky’s Boutique, but it was a normal place on an earthen, untarmacked road – what Belfast would call ghe High Street. Those were the days I tell you. Iniduals and families could afford buying new tailored clothes because the structural adjustment policies of the financial world had not yet hit our African economies. In simple words there was disposable money floating about even in countries without social security systems but people could afford basics.The cotton industry in African countries was still strong. I remember we used to pick cotton, bale it up and drive it to the local ginnery for cash. That cotton was not exported, it stayed in Kenya for the Kenyan market. Mama Vicky’s Boutique was a smaller version of the shirt factories that littered Ireland and made women the bosses of their household – correct me thereI am wrong.DILEMMA OF INHERITANCEThese unique places that kept the Irish and British economies going started shutting down . The women and male tailors in Kenya were generally not employed in big manufacturing textile mills, there were only about six such places in the country. But the feeling was the same when the garment industry faced closure. Jobs were lost and people could not sustain their livelihoods. In Africa many people had to turn to farming the smallholder units. Families rely heavily on rural inheritance, so the land favours the boys in the family and less so the girls as once they are married off, the women have to go to live in their husband’s home, hence the dilemma of inheritance. It is discriminatory against women and the laws have changed in many African countries, hopefully for the better.One day, with her permission of course, I will tell you why my mother prefers making women’s clothes.Elly O Odhiambo is a freelance writer living in West Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"toraithe ina gcumannaigh mar dhea ach an eagothromaiocht go smior sa sochai ar fad","story":"PODCHRAOLADH: Cliceáil ar an nasc thuas le héisteacht le GráinneMí ó shin, ní raibh iomrá cluinste ag go leor againn ar aipeanna mar Seesaw, Class Dojo ná Google Classroom.

He said he was grateful to everyone who#d made donations, big and small. The generosity of the Northern Ireland public and some of our business partners has been amazing, he said.All donations go towards getting meals to hospital workers, including food, delivery cost and payment processing fees.The meals can be delivered to the greater Belfast area: BT-BT in Belfast, BT- BT Holywood, Bangor, BT Newtownards, BT,  Lisburn, BT, ,  Newtownabbey, BT Antrim and BT,  Portadown, Craigavon.The delivery box includes either four portions of turkey or beef with seasonal vegetables and creamy mash potatoes plus dessert.However, the delivery box cannot be adjusted but will provide food for two days to households of two people.Elsewhere, Belfast Lord Mayor Daniel Baker is to donate the remainder of his mayoral budget to food banks across the city that are under increased pressure.The donation from my budget will be around £, with the council also agreeing to put an additional £, forward to assist foodbanks across the city, he said.As Mayor of Belfast, my priority is the health and well-being of the citizens of this great city.I hope that this initiative will help to assist citizens from the Colin to Newtownards Road, from the Falls to the Shankill.NHS staff who wish to avail of Rule of Crumb#s free Easter Sunday meals, should email nhs@ruleofcrumbBelfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But local representatives told the Belfastthe money will only be usedabsolutely necessary.DUP Westminster leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the rise to expenses, which applies to all eight party members, was indicative of the exceptional circumstances.Parliamentary authorities have made provision for MPs to avail of additional office costs to be incurred so that staff may continue to safely continue their work, he said.It allows for the purchase of any additional IT equipment for staff to work from home or for telephone systems to be amended so that important queries from constituents can still be dealt with.The support is not given directly to MPs, but enables them to purchase equipment from a central facility.The increase is obviously an exceptional measure and it was a decision taken quickly by Ipsa to assist during this exceptional time of crisis.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseColum Eastwood FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappColum EastwoodA spokeswoman for the SDLP, which has two MPs including party leader Colum Eastwood, said the cash will be a welcome boostneeded.The allowance is designed to allow MPs and staff to work effectively from home, she said.If we need to access it to enable us to provide an effective constituency service we will.Stephen Farry, who is the Alliance Party#s only representative at Westminster, said he did not think he would need to access the additional coronavirus fund.This is a decision taken independently from MPs and its purpose is to facilitate remote working, he said.I am committed to ensuring Parliament canand meet virtually during this crisis, with constructive scrutiny and accountability more important than ever. However, I don#t anticipate drawing down much,any, of this money.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseStephen FarryPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappStephen FarryA Sinn Féin spokesman said the guidelines on social distancing had created the need for additional IT equipment.This proposal is not an increase in MP or staff salary,he said. It is an uplt in office cost allowance for ensuring a constituency service can continue to operate remotely in these times of crisis and to meet the needs of constituents.Given the increased demand on constituency services at a time of public health emergency, constituency workers should be able to work safely from home or adhere to strict social distancing guidelines - this inevitably creates a need for additional IT equipment.” According to The Times, the extra funds will be available until March  and come with a relaxation of the rules on evidence of purchases.In addition to increasing the money available for MPs# office costs, the authority is also suspending the -day limit for claiming costs and relaxing the requirements on producing evidence of money spent.The monthly credit limit on MPs# payment cards has been increased to £, and the single transaction limit has been increased to £,.The authority says it will provide additional funding from the staff absence budget for workers who are unwell or cannot be in work.Responding to the announcement, Labour MP Andrew Gwynne said: Casework has explodedso it#s right that our offices remain open ­- remotely - at this time.But he added that it would have been betterIpsa had done an equipment loan scheme instead.And Conservative MP Julie Marson said: No MP will see an extra penny of this in their bank accounts.Ipsa increased the office budget to provide staff who primarily work from the office the ability to work from home, and to produce and distribute Covid- information.Ipsa was established in the wake of the  MPs# expenses scandal.

And this year, pregnant women also have to worry about Covid-, a virus that can affect a person’s lungs and airways.Last week, the UK government announced that pregnant women were at an increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus.However, the advice to pregnant women was described by Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty as “a precautionary measure” because “we are early in our understanding of this virus and we want to be sure.”So how does the coronavirus crisis affect youyou are pregnant or have just had a baby This advice was compiled with the help of Dr David Glenn FRCOG, a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at Kingsbridge Private Hospital and Clinical Director for Women and Child Health at Ulster Hospital.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr David Glenn FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr David GlennWhy are pregnant women in the high-risk category Pregnant women do not appear more likely to contract the infection than the general population. Pregnancy itself alters the body’s immune system and response to viral infections in general, which can occasionally be related to more severe symptoms and this will be the same for Covid-.Can a pregnant woman pass coronavirus on to her baby Transmission from mother to baby during the pregnancy or delivery is probable, although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, placenta swabs, genital fluid and breastmilk samples from Covid- infected mothers have so far tested negative for the virus. However, a new report describes a case in which the baby born to a Covid- positive mother was found to have antibodies in their blood at birth. This is thought to represent a baby’s response to infection within the womb.Is there a greater chance of miscarriageyou test positive for Covid- There is currently no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in relation to Covid-.Moreover, there is no evidence that the virus damages the baby. Despite recent evidence that the virus can be passed from mother to baby, the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined.What symptoms should pregnant women be aware of, and what should they dothey are experiencing any of them If you are infected with Covid- you are still most likely to have no symptoms or a mild illness from which you will make a full recovery. Most women will experience only mild or moderate cold flu like symptoms. Cough, fever, shortness of breath, lack of smell taste and even gastrointestinal symptoms are other relevant presentations.For women who have had symptoms, antenatal appointments can be deferred until  days after the start of symptoms, unless symptomspersevere.For women who are self-isolating because someone in their household has possible symptoms of Covid-, appointments should be deferred for  days.If women develop more severe symptoms or her recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that they are developing a more signicant chest infection that requires enhanced care. In this situation you should contact your maternity care team.Are all antenatal appointments going ahead as normal in Northern Ireland If you are well at the moment and have had no complications in your previous pregnancies arrangements for your care may be altered but they are still important to attend.If you have a routine scan or visit due in the coming days, you will still need to attend but the appointment may change due to staffing requirements. Maternity care is essential to reduce complications in mothers and babies. Even in the context of coronavirus, it is important that pregnant women continue to attend their scheduled routine care when they are well.Pregnant women will be asked to keep the number of people with you to a minimum. This will include being asked to attend maternity appointments alone.There may also be a need to reduce the number of routine antenatal visits.If women have an urgent problem related to the pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, they should get in touch using the same emergency contact details they already have. They should not contact that number unless they have an urgent problem.If women have symptoms of coronavirus, they should contact their maternity service and they will arrange the right place and time for the visits. They should not attend a routine clinic.What risks are there of an expectant mother contracting Covid- on a trip to hospital for an antenatal appointment Maternity care is essential and has been developed over many years with improving success to reduce complications in mothers and babies. The risks of not attending care include harm to mother, her baby or both.Many provisions have been put in place to reduce risk to mothers. These include reducing the number of visits to the hospital to a minimum, advice to mothers on reducing the number of people travelling with mothers to the hospital, attending the appointments alone, keeping numbers reduced in waiting rooms, spacing patients in waiting areas, staff taking additional protective efforts to reduce transmission in clinics with hand washing, cleaning equipment etc.How prepared are hospitals to deal with pregnant women with the virus Very signicant changes have been occurring in hospitals over the past weeks to deal with pregnant women with Covid-. Signicant changes have been made in all areas of the hospital, from clinics to wards and including delivery suites. Practice drills are being run frequently to train staff, additional resources have been brought in to help and a huge effort has been made by all levels of non-clinical, clinical, administrative and management staff.If the mother of a baby has symptoms or tests positive for Covid-, should she isolate herself from the baby Given the current limited evidence, we advise that women and healthy infants, not otherwise requiring neonatal care, are kept together in the immediate post-partum period.A risks benefits discussion with neonatologists and families to inidualise care in babies who may be more susceptible is recommended.Can a new mother with the virus breastfeed The main risk of breastfeeding for infants is the close contact with the mother, who is likely to share infective droplets. In the light of the current evidence, it is advised that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. Precautions should be taken to reduce spread to the baby such as, hand washing before touching the baby, avoiding coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding, and considering wearing a face mask,available, while feeding or caring for the baby.Can a pregnant person be accompanied by a partner or have visitors A person in labour can be accompanied by one birthing partner, according to the new guidelines. No visitors are permitted in ante-natal or post-natal ward areas.Will babies continue to be delivered in all Northern Ireland hospitals No, not at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine. Antenatal services will continue but it is not possible to deliver babies in the hospital during this surge period.This is due to a lack skilled paediatricians available to provide emergency care to a baby born in distress throughout the  hour period. To protect the wellbeing of mothers and babies, women booked to deliver in Causeway will be contacted and have their delivery transferred to Antrim or Altnagelvin Hospital.Should parents introduce their newborn to friends and family Current government guidance is that you should not meet with people outside your household, so no family celebrations are permitted at present.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The one exception was at the weekend when my we and I drove over to my daughter#s house nearby to look through the window at three of our seven grandchildren.You see, we have a new grandson who is three weeks old so we were able to take a look at him through the glass, evenwe couldn#t hold him.The coronavirus situation has had a huge impact on us, like it has on everyone . In a way I feel like we#re very lucky because we#re out in the country and we have plenty of room in the garden to get out and get a bit of air.Some days I feel asI#m competing to have the best mown lawn in the country, I#m tidying it up that much. We#ll be able to play golf on it before long. And I#m doing wee quirky things too, like a bit more cooking and bingeing on box sets.But it has been dficult too. For  years I#ve run a business, a factory  yards from my house where we create bespoke kitchens and furniture. We have  employees. So for  years that#s been my lestyle.I#ve been up and about, in and out of my work and the house from .am until pm in the evening, or later, but we furloughed the business on March , the day after the lockdown came into effect.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDeclan with his we Maria and granddaughter Moya before the lockdown FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDeclan with his we Maria and granddaughter Moya before the lockdownIt was a very upsetting thing to do, especially thinking about all the people we had to send home from their jobs.It#s the biggest call I can remember making in all that time but I think it was the right thing to do to protect us all for when we come out of this thing.I#m in a high-risk category for Covid- because I#ve got a heart condition, which was detected quite recently.I was due to have a procedure soon to deal with it, but because of everything that#s going on it#s been cancelled for now.I decided to isolate myself even before the government lockdown, so I haven#t been into Newry in more than two weeks, which is very strange.Normally I#d be in and out of the town at least once or twice a day, so I am feeling the effect of this in a big way. I#m in the house on my own quite a bit because my we is carrying on going to her work in the hospital.It#s strange to have my routine completely knocked on the head.From days when I#d be so busy morning to night with people milling around all the time in and out of the factory, it#s become very quiet and there#s a lot less activity going on.I#m doing some work in the house on my laptop, bits of admin and keeping in touch with my son who also works in the business.But compared to what it was, it#s very dferent. My we and I were supposed to be going to New York with our daughter and son-in-law a few days before St Patrick#s Day, but we cancelled. I#m relieved we did because the situation over there seems to be dire, and at least we avoided getting caught up in it or bringing it back home with us.The thing about it all is that, while it#s strange and dficult to adjust to, I think it will have a lasting impact. It#s definitely made me sit up and think what was all the rushing about for. If we#re lucky to come through it all then maybe it#s time to have a look at it and change our perspectives a bit.As well as my we working in the NHS, my daughter is a consultant up in the Royal in Belfast, so it#s a worrying time. It#s certainly made me sit back and take stock.We don#t really need the foreign holidays or to be so busy in our lives all the time. What we actually need is to slow down and realise what matters - our families, our health, a good quality of le in our local areas.It#s been a huge wake-up call and a huge chance to make some serious changes when this very dficult situation comes to an end.‘Living in a fth floor flat, we feel trapped.

It#s been hard for all of us, and especially because I#d be classed as a high-risk person. I had a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago, and while I#m about to hit four years clear it won#t be until the five-year mark that I#ll be able to feel truly confident.My immune system took a real knock through the treatment so when everything started to become more serious with the coronavirus outbreak we knew it was going to be major.When you have cancer, you learn to take every day as it comes and try to avoid going down the road of stressing about everything because it really doesn#t help.Living in the high-rises at the minute really isn#t easy. Daisy and I don#t get out - except that I get to leave the flat to do some volunteering at the Dunanney Centre to help other people in the Rathcoole community. But other than that, Daisy and I are pretty much stuck inside.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDaisy looks out the window FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDaisy looks out the windowDave is a key worker so he#s carried on as he works in distribution for animal feed. He#s the only one of us really going anywhere.We have three bedrooms in the flat, with a separate bathroom and toilet, a living room and a kitchen.It#s quite good in size compared to what some other people have, but being trapped inside all the time makes you realise just how small it is. We don#t have a garden to open the back door into. We don#t have a balcony, and our windows have latches on them so they only open a very small crack.You can take the latches offyou need to, but for now with Daisy so young I don#t even want to go there, so we keep the latches on. I keep the blinds pulled right back so any sunshine there is can get in, and the windows are open a crack for some air, but that#s it really. It will be hard as the weather gets nicer.There are communal areas outside, and we have communal lts to get you down there. Butwe do that then we#re running the risk of being in close contact with other people, and none of us know who may have symptoms or could have been exposed to this.Not getting out into the fresh air is very dficult. I suppose it#s getting me down a bit, and the longer it goes on the more I#m feeling a bit anxious. But I know it#s the right thing to do. Luckily Daisy has taken it really well. She#s not at the point where she#s tearing her hair out wanting to get outside. She misses the park and getting to school with her friends, but she#s been really understanding and accepting of the situation.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJillian with husband Dave FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJillian with husband DaveHer school was great in explaining a bit about the coronavirus so she knows we#re inside to stay safe and that it won#t last forever.What I#m desperate for is to be able to take Daisy to the park. Normally we stop off on the way home from school so she can have a run about for  minutes before we go home to do her homework, but now everything is limited to inside.We#re still doing some exercise. She really enjoys dancing and we put music on and she makes up dances and practices her cartwheels. I#ve got my stepper on my phone, and we go walking around between rooms to get our steps up.It#s actually been fine because we#re just doing our best to fill our days, and be flexible with it. I think trying to impose a strict timetable on ourselves just wouldn#t work, because this just isn#t a normal time.Our usual routine is completely gone. I don#t work, but I volunteer in the community as a Listening Ear and at other groups, and between that and school as well as Daisy#s Girls# Brigade we usually have a lot to keep ourselves busy.For now though we#re just trying our best, like everyone . When Dave is off he#s doing wee cookery classes with Daisy, and as well as that we#re trying to do a bit of school work every day because she#s always really enjoyed learning. I don#t want that to be something she loses because of all this.The next thing to think about is Daisy#s birthday, which is later this month, a couple of days after mine. We#ve told her she#s going to be like the Queen, with two birthdays in .She#ll have a small one at home with me and her daddy and then a lovely big one later on when all of this stuff comes to an end.

What I have been saying all along is the need to try to look at the cumulative effect, he said.Mr Kinahan suggested that each new application is just seen as one.He also questioned the ability of Ballyclare#s sewerage network to cope with any new housing developments.He said he has written to the Department of Infrastructure to highlight the issue of sewerage.According to a recent letter sent to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council by NI Water, half of Northern Ireland#s sewers will be full by  and wastewater treatment works in more than  areas across Northern Ireland are at or rapidly approaching full capacity and where NI Water is unlikely to be able to accept additional sewer connections.Northern Ireland#s wastewater infrastructure is at serious risk and nearly every main urban area is impacted, the letter stated. The council was told that these areas include Belfast, Ballymena, Carrickfergus, Larne, Antrim and Ballyclare.The letter continued: The economic consequences are clear with new housing, businesses, schools, hospitals and tourism all seriously affected. We are now facing a tipping point and collectively need to urgently make decisions about the structure of funding of NI Waterwe are to continue to provide the water and sewerage services which are expected in a healthy economy.According to the Belfast politan Area Plan , almost  hectares of land have been zoned for housing on the site of the former basalt quarry overall.The Plan says that public infrastructure and road improvements are expected to include provision for cycle and pedestrian links to Ballyeaston Road and Ballycorr Road.The proposed new houses will front onto Ballycorr Road and Ballyeaston Road. The Plan has stated that a proposed development on the former quarry site should include provision for a local neighbourhood centre to include local retail outlets and community facilities.A multi-purpose hall and a #Healthy Living Centre# to accommodate medical and fitness facilities have been suggested. All existing trees, shrubs and hedgerows within the site and on boundaries must be retained and construction will not be permitted between March and July in a bid to limit disturbance to breeding peregrine falcons.A geology report by Earth Science Conservation Review has stated that the best exposures of the lower basalt formation in the Ballyclare area are to be found at Craighill Quarry.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus: PSNI probe gathering for ex-Sinn Fein councillor#s funeralDon#t take Lisburn anti-NHS graffiti personally, MLA Butler urges health workersMotorcyclist who died in Armagh crash had become dad for first timeCoronavirus: Police to display #dferent approach and attitude# over Easter weekendMan charged after #CIRA# graffiti scrawled around Ballymena town,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Professor Kieran McEvoy from the School of Law at Queen#s University led the team behind the report. The latest Government statement appears to envisage the abandonment of the structures proposed in the Stormont House Agreement in favour of a process wherein the bulk of outstanding conflict investigations would be #fast-tracked#, he said. It is dficult to see how this could allow for an effective investigation.It is clear that a driving influence on the UK Government#s approach has been a desire to ensure soldiers do not go to prison for conflict-related offences.QUB Law Professor Louise Mallinder said the CAJ report offers a new proposal on sentencing.Bearing in mind the Government#s clear determination to keep soldiers out of prison, we have reviewed a number of options which would see the Stormont House Agreement implemented in full - but where the current two-year sentence before being considered for early release could be reduced to zero, she said.DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the new Government proposals had been a much needed fresh approach.The Stormont House Agreement legacy proposals lack the support of many innocent victims, he said.It is vital that justice and truth are not denied to those innocent victims and that there is no provision to re-write the past.Ulster Unionist justice spokesman Doug Beattie said the time for victims being ignored by the Stormont House Agreement was over. Innocent victims have been let down time and again by legacy arrangements, he said.Now we have a group of self-appointed experts with proposals to reduce the tarf on Troubles-related convictions to a zero term sentence. It would neatly fit the agenda of those who want to rewrite the history of the Troubles, he added.Sinn Fein#s Gerry Kelly welcomed the new report. The analysis of the options is timely, given the signicant sht in the British Government#s position last month, where they unilaterally attempted to reconstruct and rewrite the Stormont House Agreement, he said.Any cherry picking or attempted solo run by the British Government is unlikely to secure the support or agreement of the other parties.SDLP Policing Board member Dolores Kelly MLA has said the report was a robust rejection of the Government narrative of a witch-hunt against former soldiers.It is clear that the Government#s latest legacy proposals are motivated by a political desire to shield former soldiers, Ms Kelly said. I do have to express reservations about proposals to reduce the tarf on troubles-related convictions to a zero term sentence.Alliance Justice spokesperson Stephen Farry said his party would give the latest report full consideration. Any approach for dealing with legacy must be consistent with the rule of law and human rights compliant, he said.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus: PSNI probe gathering for ex-Sinn Fein councillor#s funeralDon#t take Lisburn anti-NHS graffiti personally, MLA Butler urges health workersMotorcyclist who died in Armagh crash had become dad for first timeCoronavirus: Police to display #dferent approach and attitude# over Easter weekendMan arrested after #CIRA# graffiti scrawled around Ballymena town,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Well, it came from China, but you know what I mean! Our world as we know it has changed, but not forever… It is horrible for families in isolation as they cannot visit friends, family, or play sports. The elderly are alone and afraid with only doorstep conversations . People are getting sick and this virus is taking control! For me personally, I hate this thing and what it’s doing. I miss my friends, I miss my cousins and I especially miss my grandparents. My Granny Jean is  tomorrow and I can’t even visit her. Mummy and me are making a cakefor her but there will be no party – for now. googletag.cmd.push I also miss my football matches and trips to the club to watch my brothers play. The club is locked up now when it should be packed with football and camogie every night. I can’t wait for it to reopen. I’m daydreaming about trips to the beach, the cinema, the restaurants in Belfast and even our next holiday to Portugal. The endless days at home are giving me cabin fever – the war on WiFi here is endless! Then there is the handwashing… I really miss the classroom. My teacher, Mrs McLea, uploads voice messages of morning prayer and greetings to us every morning and I look forward to that as we all get a chance to say something to each other. googletag.cmd.push I really hope Covid- disappears soon so I can get back to St Mary’s for my final days there in P. We had so much planned…school trips, leavers’ mass, Confirmation. Our plans have changed now and it’s just such a shame. Wouldn’t it be great not to have to worry about Covid- anymore and just have our old le back! It is dficult to see any positives with this situation but we should look on the bright side of these times. Global warming has been reduced because not many people are going out in their cars and high pollution factories have been on lockdown too. Our planet is getting a well-earned rest! We are all getting a break or a rest as we’re not rushing anywhere! I am spending more time with my brothers - evenit is to get a haircut in the kitchen with Luke’s new hair clippers. Not getting up until I actually waken is nice. I am enjoying baking and cooking with mammy – I am getting good at it! We say an Our Father together at am every day for those with the virus to recover and for the NHS staff . I am grateful at least for the Xbox. I can still chat and stay connected with friends online . I love watching films with Daddy as it is normally only Christmas we get the chance to do that so much. Sometimes it feels like we are on holidays, especiallyit’s a late Netflix! There is the odd darts, pool and poker competition at home now – that should cover the maths home schooling surely ! I suppose with the weather improving we can always go outside more. The trampoline is back in use and I’ll practise my football – maybe my left foot! I hope Covid- will go away forever and when the world s to normal, what a better world it will be. I think we will all have learned new skills and how to make the best of a bad time. We’ll be so thankful and appreciate everything and everyone even more!

Castledawson man Jason is currently renting a flat on Ireton Street, off Botanic Avenue near Queen’s University in south Belfast with three other students. Jason said his letting agency were unsympathetic to the students’ situation, saying there was nothing they could do. He told Derry Now: “They said it wasn’t their problem – that was what guarantors were for. “The situation is that they won’t give us any sort of leeway in terms of paying it when they know we’re not in the house due to university being cancelled. googletag.cmd.push “They’ve said it’s not their problem because it’s privately rented and I understand that to a point, but common sense has to kick in somewhere.” Jason and his flatmates are renting their accommodation through USPM Ltd, a letting agent based on University Road and say they had to initiate contact about Covid-. “There’s very little contact with the letting agency unless you miss or have to arrange a payment. They hadn’t contacted us about the pandemic, we had to do the ringing,” said Jason. “I rang them, and our contact said they understood the frustration but there was nothing they could do. To them, we were renting a house in Belfast to live in. googletag.cmd.push “Our landlords are usually dead on, butthey had any sort of generosity, they could do something. It’s not always up to the person on the end of the phone.” While Jason is able to fall back on the support of his family, he realises not everyone has that support available. He said: “I have a few friends who wouldn’t come home as much, they don’t have a stable home to come home to and they’re paying rent through jobs in Belfast. “A lot of them were in part-time jobs and have now been laid off. They have no way to continue that, no income. It’s not a good situation for them.” Jason believes the ‘mortgage holidays’ mooted by the government could provide the solution to the problem, but that the options did not appear to be being explored. “Anybody renting privately is just being made to pay. There are no mortgage holidays coming into play,” he said. “We’re probably now having to pay- months where we aren’t there whereas we had been in years gone by. That’s probably half the year of not being in the house and having to pay for it. “If they can take mortgage holidays, there is absolutely no reason for us to be paying rent, except for making a profit.” Derry Now contacted UPSM Ltd for a response, but none was available at the time of going to print.

Derry Trades Union Council chair, Niall McCarroll, said: The global Covid- crisis means we cant celebrate May Day, the international workers day, in the way we normally would. This year we were working with Derry and Strabane Council to host a Workers Rights and Social Justice Week culminating with the May Day march and rally. The Covid- crisis is causing tremendous pain and hardship. We are in the midst of a tragedy that we hope will end as soon as possible with as few deaths as possible. googletag.cmd.push The response to the crisis has also put a spotlight on the inadequacy of government action, the state of our public services and the central role of workers saving lives, protecting communities and allowing society to . Many in the political establishment have joined claps in recent weeks for our heroic nurses and frontline workers but they have spent the last decades justying poverty wages, undermining trade union representation and dismantling our public services, including our health service. The hypocrisy is glaring. Governments have described the battle to contain Covid- as a war but theyve sent frontline workers out without PPE and testing. Far too many employers have risked workplace and public safety by refusing to implement public health guidelines. Workers have been forced to take strike action to make sure health guidelines are followed. googletag.cmd.push Its crucial we put a focus on the heroic efforts of workersresponding to this crisis, on the need for workers rights and on the central importance of our public services. The Derry Trades Union Council is calling on everyone to mark this May Day by joining a Five Minutes of Noise for Workers Rights at pm on Friday May st - and by putting up red flags and signs for workers rights from homes and workplaces for  hours. Well be working with unions, community groups, equality campaigners, artists and others that we were collaborating with for the Workers Rights and Social Justice Week to organise as much as possible through social media. We will be launching our Workers Charter - our vision for dignity, respect and justice at work, in communities and for a more equal society. Were calling on the trade unions and organisations supporting workers rights across Ireland, North and South, to join this effort. People from all backgrounds and communities deserve workers rights,dignity and equality. We want this event to be as inclusive as possible. We need to begin to shape a new way of doing things thats centred around recognising the value of workers and the needs of the working class communities.

Like a B-rated sci-fi movie, our world is being ravaged by a killer virus which will affect tens of thousands, maybe millions. No-one knows. The experts disagree. Politicians do too, though that’s less of a concern. Worst, there is no certainty of a happy ending, with a superhero with special powers and a shiny suit to sort it all out. In a world where for almost all illnesses, we have effective diagnosis and treatment, and international experience and research to guide management, this Covid  lark is beyond our comprehension.We people who are accustomed to a pill for every ill must readjust to a new set of paradigms. googletag.cmd.push The prospect of arbitrary illness and possible death, without the presence of loved ones at the bedside, and for those of faith, the comfort of the sacraments, is terrying. For families, being unable to have the beautul and peculiarly Irish ritual of farewell, a wake and funeral to grieve and offer thanks, compounds the dread. We know that the young and healthy are likely to come through this, and that it is our elderly who are likely to succumb. Many of the sacrices we make are to protect the vulnerable and those who care for them. But there are no guarantees that any of us is safe. googletag.cmd.push Prince and pauper are vulnerable-tho it’s fair to assume that the prince isn’t coping from a homeless shelter or wracked with worry about how the bills will be paid. As with all human endeavour, there is goodness in abundance. People are delivering hot meals from their own resources to the isolated and vulnerable. Supermarket staff are stocking shelves, scanning tins and packets and smiling through the fear. Council staff empty bins, clean the streets and work from home to keep the wheels of this city turning. Bus drivers, mechanics, what we used to call lorry drivers but are now logistics operatives, all are at their posts, so that we can eat and stay healthy. Mammies and daddies, facing their own worries are reassuring their children that all will be well, putting them over their lessons and trying their best to keep them occupied and safe.So many people who have left work are offering their skills and experience to help in whatever way they can. Machinists skilled from years in Derry’s factories are working at home making masks to protect their neighbours. An incredible , people have volunteered to help the beleaguered NHS. A friend confided regarding her own health worries that she wasn’t concerned so much about herself, but about what might happen her mother with dementia, for whom she cares at home. This is love in action. Our postman came this morning, our usual chat done at two metres distance. We still managed to cover our usual repertoire of politics, weather, health and families, while keeping two metres part. My washing machine packed in. Well I think it’s a vital service, so I rang the man, fully expecting him to tell me to get lost. He told me he would look at it, but wanted to work alone, as his son is immunosuppressed. He came in the back door, I left the money in an envelope, and my clothesline now flutters with clean sheets. I feel especially for our young people, the unique, primal, mad impulsive joy of teenage springtime pulsing in their veins with the first sunny days. They are staying indoors, chatting online, putting in the days, making mad memes for the craic and to keep sane. My niece, doing her Leaving, and with no prospect of exams, is still doing a bit of study, and helping her daddy plant spuds.Her school days ended without the rituals of parties and goodbyes. Even our wee Fionnuala, my four year old grandchild, who lives with us and is the light of our lives in these dark days, knows that school is now at the kitchen table, because of the bad germs which and might make people sick. She washes her hands hourly - and the floor and walls - with enthusiasm and great care. Everywhere, people are doing what they must, often at great personal cost, while struggling with their own worries about work, bills and what the future will bring. They do these things cheerfully and in the best way they can. Superheroes don’t always wear fancy costumes, they are all around us. In these surreal times, we see our old certainties and values exposed as worthless. They seem to have been replaced by an older and more tried and tested value system, less about rights, and more about what is right. Let’s hope that these lessons stick when Covid  is a distant memory.

Kieran Stevenson was man of the match in their win over Antrim and Michael McMullan spoke with the Derry keeper, as he rekindled the memories of their golden era.  For  years, Derry had wandered around in Ulsters hurling wilderness. Until that moment. The  Ulster final was ticking towards a conclusion. Mickey Collins won a free which his brother Ollie drove between the posts at the Andersonstown Road end. Derry fans among the , strong Casement Park attendance exploded into another frenzy, as their caman-wielding heroes hit the front again. googletag.cmd.push Was this eventually going to be their day  Not just yet. There was time for Antrim to cast the dice one last time. Gary OKane composed himself over a stoppage time sideline cut. The wind carried the sliotar into the danger-zone, where vigilant Derry goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson deflected it wide. It was the last action and the final whistle kick-started an outpouring of emotion for the new Ulster champions. Bullfrog was the keeper in Banaghers three-in-a-row winning minor team, before moving into the county scene. An -year career began in , as understudy to Laveys Fergal Shorty McNally. The following year, he was second choice behind Padraig Oacute Mianaacutein when Derry won the All-Ireland B championship. googletag.cmd.push In , the Us lost to Antrimin the Ulster final. From that team, captain Colin McEldowney, Benny Ward, Mickey Conway, Gary Biggs and Geoffrey McGonigle would help spearhead Derry seniors towards Division One. The minors lost in the final that year, to the Saffrons, by an almost identical margin and Stevenson was the keeper on both teams. In , the Us took Antrim to a replay and  frees from the unerring Dermot Doherty, on his own Emmet Park turf, finished the job as Derry took the title in mid-week extra-time thriller. “That was a good win,” Stevenson recalls. “Antrim were always the team to beat, in terms of the county.” Things began to change. They ran Antrim to three points in the  senior final, but lost convincingly the following year. It was a spell in hurlings top tier that made the wheels of change turn that bit quicker. Promotion at the end of  began a four-year stint in the top flight. They ran Waterford to seven points at Ballinascreen in their first outing, before facing Cork and Kilkenny. The cream of hurling was lting Derrys standards. A -point slump to Tipperary, in Thurles, was their toughest afternoon. A one-point defeat in Laois was the one that got away, leaving Derry needing to beat Kerry in a relegation play-off to stay afloat before dropping down at end of the  campaign. “I think it as the Division One hurling that stuck to us and we were on an upward curve,” Stevenson feels. “There were more players added to the . “Derry hurlingwas about filling up the numbers and going out to play the matches. Then it changed and everybody was taking it serious. The club scene was improving and you could see the skill level going up from  to .” HARMONY In an interview three years ago, Conor Murray painted the Derry hurling scene he played on at the start of the noughties as a family. A unique one, with club rivalry left at the gates of Owenbeg and picked up on the way home. Stevenson agrees. “No club stuck to themselves, everybody got on well with everybody,” he said. Other managers werent chirping in players ears, telling them not to commit to the small ball game. In the  season, Kieran McKeever threw his lot in with the hurlers, while also playing in an Ulster football final weeks later. “Players were not restricted in playing for the county, in terms of hurling and everybody gelled,” Stevenson added A mountain of upside-down kit bags would be erected in the aisle of the team bus, with a coat thrown over it. Hey presto, they had a card table, around which they laughed on their journey to whatever battle they would later brace themselves for. It got more advanced when Stevenson, a kitchen manufacturer by trade, patented a custom-made card table. “When we were coming home, we were arm-wrestling on it and it was all a bit of craic,” he joked.  Emmett McKeever, Kieran McKeever and Geoffrey McGonigle celebrate Derrys  Ulster title. Steering the ship was Cushendall man Kevin McNaughton. After spending time helping foster Swatraghs structures and leading them to back to back intermediate championships, he came on board with Derry at the start of the  season. His trusted lieutenant, from the Swa, Roger Anthony Quinn, Laveys hurling godfather Tom Magill, Banaghers Gerard McCloskey and athletics coach Malcolm McCausland made up the management team. Heading up the M for the  final, Derry were in a decent place, following a - to - win over a Down team who had beaten New York in the quarter-final. Antrim were -point winners over London in their semi-final, but Derry blitzed them in the first half of the decider. Rookie defenders Emmett OHara and Declan McKillop were led a merry dance by the Derry attack. Ace attacker Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever were missing through suspension. That told enough of the depth in Derrys squad. “We were getting better with playing all the better teams. There was plenty of skill, speed and fitness in the team. It was about trying to put it all together...it was a good ,” Stevenson explained. McKeever had been suspended after being sent off with Downs Noel Sands in the semi-final, on the advice of a linesman. With high-ranking officials on their July holidays, the appeal – lodged before the end of June – wasnt heard and McKeever would miss the final. “Beefywas our best player in defence...he was lethal,” Stevenson said of his captain. “We wanted to try and win it for him because he was hard done by. He was well-liked and in every match, hed have put his head in front of the hurl to stop the ball. “Antrim had Alistair Elliott, Gregory OKane was full-forward and Gary OKane started at centre half-forward, before going back .” DREAM START Kieran McKeever, Gary Biggs and Ollie Collins hit first half goals to leave Antrims foundations rocking. The Saffrons didnt score from play for  minutes. “We shouldve been further ahead,” said Stevenson of their - to - interval lead. “We had missed a pile of scoring opportunities and we were against the breeze in the second half. “We knewthe forwards were getting on the ball, they could score goals because they were skilful and quick.” Derrys backs were to the wall as Antrim notched  unanswered points and, with  minutes gone, went four points ahead. Derry replied with points to take the wind out of Antrims sails. Their case was helped further when John ODywer finished to the net for the crucial fourth Oakleafers goal. “It was the goals that won us the match,” Stevenson said. “I still have a hurling ball in the house, with the scorewritten on it.” All the press cuttings and programmes were kept too. A raft of memories from the glory years. But the hurl that deflected Gary OKanes last minute sideline cut to safety is long gone. “Some wee Belfast boy stole it,” Stevenson reckons. The Derry squad threw their history-making hurls on the turf to celebrate and within minutes they had vanished. “When the final was blown, it was more thepressure, you were always checking the time to see what was left. If the game had went onthere was less likelihood that we couldve won the game.” Conor Murray accepted the cup in the stand, before taking it down to the pitch for the suspended Emmett McKeever to again hoist it skywards to salute the magical moment. “We were there on merit,” was Stevensons assessment of their win. “We had a good defence and a good forward line. When you take the likes of John ODwyer, Geoffrey and Mickey Collins as your front three – you have a good side. “Conor Murray at full-back was safe, you had Collieand Niall Mullan in the corners.” Stevenson picked up the man of the match award and added to it with the Ulster hurler of the year accolade the following season when Derry retained their title. Later that night, the team partied into the wee small hours in Dungiven club. You could barely turn a sweet in your mouth. It was jam packed. Before that, on the joyous journey home, there was a poignant moment when the players got off the bus to carry the cup over the River Bann in Toome. “We had talked about it in previous years – the days when we were beaten,” Stevenson remembers. “It was a short walk, the boys were more interested in getting on the bus and heading on home.” Derrys fallow  years was over.

Bullfrog was the keeper in Banaghers three-in-a-row winning minor team, before moving into the county scene. An -year career began in , as understudy to Laveys Fergal Shorty McNally. The following year, he was second choice behind Padraig Oacute Mianaacutein when Derry won the All-Ireland B championship. googletag.cmd.push In , the Us lost to Antrimin the Ulster final. From that team, captain Colin McEldowney, Benny Ward, Mickey Conway, Gary Biggs and Geoffrey McGonigle would help spearhead Derry seniors towards Division One. The minors lost in the final that year, to the Saffrons, by an almost identical margin and Stevenson was the keeper on both teams. In , the Us took Antrim to a replay and  frees from the unerring Dermot Doherty, on his own Emmet Park turf, finished the job as Derry took the title in mid-week extra-time thriller. “That was a good win,” Stevenson recalls. “Antrim were always the team to beat, in terms of the county.” Things began to change. They ran Antrim to three points in the  senior final, but lost convincingly the following year. It was a spell in hurlings top tier that made the wheels of change turn that bit quicker. Promotion at the end of  began a four-year stint in the top flight. They ran Waterford to seven points at Ballinascreen in their first outing, before facing Cork and Kilkenny. The cream of hurling was lting Derrys standards. A -point slump to Tipperary, in Thurles, was their toughest afternoon. A one-point defeat in Laois was the one that got away, leaving Derry needing to beat Kerry in a relegation play-off to stay afloat before dropping down at end of the  campaign. “I think it as the Division One hurling that stuck to us and we were on an upward curve,” Stevenson feels. “There were more players added to the . “Derry hurlingwas about filling up the numbers and going out to play the matches. Then it changed and everybody was taking it serious. The club scene was improving and you could see the skill level going up from  to .” HARMONY In an interview three years ago, Conor Murray painted the Derry hurling scene he played on at the start of the noughties as a family. A unique one, with club rivalry left at the gates of Owenbeg and picked up on the way home. Stevenson agrees. “No club stuck to themselves, everybody got on well with everybody,” he said. Other managers werent chirping in players ears, telling them not to commit to the small ball game. In the  season, Kieran McKeever threw his lot in with the hurlers, while also playing in an Ulster football final weeks later. “Players were not restricted in playing for the county, in terms of hurling and everybody gelled,” Stevenson added A mountain of upside-down kit bags would be erected in the aisle of the team bus, with a coat thrown over it. Hey presto, they had a card table, around which they laughed on their journey to whatever battle they would later brace themselves for. It got more advanced when Stevenson, a kitchen manufacturer by trade, patented a custom-made card table. “When we were coming home, we were arm-wrestling on it and it was all a bit of craic,” he joked.  Emmett McKeever, Kieran McKeever and Geoffrey McGonigle celebrate Derrys  Ulster title. Steering the ship was Cushendall man Kevin McNaughton. After spending time helping foster Swatraghs structures and leading them to back to back intermediate championships, he came on board with Derry at the start of the  season. His trusted lieutenant, from the Swa, Roger Anthony Quinn, Laveys hurling godfather Tom Magill, Banaghers Gerard McCloskey and athletics coach Malcolm McCausland made up the management team. Heading up the M for the  final, Derry were in a decent place, following a - to - win over a Down team who had beaten New York in the quarter-final. Antrim were -point winners over London in their semi-final, but Derry blitzed them in the first half of the decider. Rookie defenders Emmett OHara and Declan McKillop were led a merry dance by the Derry attack. Ace attacker Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever were missing through suspension. That told enough of the depth in Derrys squad. “We were getting better with playing all the better teams. There was plenty of skill, speed and fitness in the team. It was about trying to put it all together...it was a good ,” Stevenson explained. McKeever had been suspended after being sent off with Downs Noel Sands in the semi-final, on the advice of a linesman. With high-ranking officials on their July holidays, the appeal – lodged before the end of June – wasnt heard and McKeever would miss the final. “Beefywas our best player in defence...he was lethal,” Stevenson said of his captain. “We wanted to try and win it for him because he was hard done by. He was well-liked and in every match, hed have put his head in front of the hurl to stop the ball. “Antrim had Alistair Elliott, Gregory OKane was full-forward and Gary OKane started at centre half-forward, before going back .” DREAM START Kieran McKeever, Gary Biggs and Ollie Collins hit first half goals to leave Antrims foundations rocking. The Saffrons didnt score from play for  minutes. “We shouldve been further ahead,” said Stevenson of their - to - interval lead. “We had missed a pile of scoring opportunities and we were against the breeze in the second half. “We knewthe forwards were getting on the ball, they could score goals because they were skilful and quick.” Derrys backs were to the wall as Antrim notched  unanswered points and, with  minutes gone, went four points ahead. Derry replied with points to take the wind out of Antrims sails. Their case was helped further when John ODywer finished to the net for the crucial fourth Oakleafers goal. “It was the goals that won us the match,” Stevenson said. “I still have a hurling ball in the house, with the scorewritten on it.” All the press cuttings and programmes were kept too. A raft of memories from the glory years. But the hurl that deflected Gary OKanes last minute sideline cut to safety is long gone. “Some wee Belfast boy stole it,” Stevenson reckons. The Derry squad threw their history-making hurls on the turf to celebrate and within minutes they had vanished. “When the final was blown, it was more thepressure, you were always checking the time to see what was left. If the game had went onthere was less likelihood that we couldve won the game.” Conor Murray accepted the cup in the stand, before taking it down to the pitch for the suspended Emmett McKeever to again hoist it skywards to salute the magical moment. “We were there on merit,” was Stevensons assessment of their win. “We had a good defence and a good forward line. When you take the likes of John ODwyer, Geoffrey and Mickey Collins as your front three – you have a good side. “Conor Murray at full-back was safe, you had Collieand Niall Mullan in the corners.” Stevenson picked up the man of the match award and added to it with the Ulster hurler of the year accolade the following season when Derry retained their title. Later that night, the team partied into the wee small hours in Dungiven club. You could barely turn a sweet in your mouth. It was jam packed. Before that, on the joyous journey home, there was a poignant moment when the players got off the bus to carry the cup over the River Bann in Toome. “We had talked about it in previous years – the days when we were beaten,” Stevenson remembers. “It was a short walk, the boys were more interested in getting on the bus and heading on home.” Derrys fallow  years was over.

I went off to my daughter’s school and got everything sorted out and then came out home. “I thought we’d all go to the beach a run and walk the dogs to get away from the chaos for an hour, but I wasn’t in the house ten minutes until the police landed.” Maggie immediately realised her mistake when the police officers appeared, and they accompanied her back to Tesco so she could pay her bill. googletag.cmd.push However, once she had paid the outstanding amount at the Customer Service Desk, she was waved over by the store’s security guard. She said: “The security man was talking to what turned out to be a manager and he waved me over.

He said he would need my name, address and date of birth. I said I’d already given that to the police. “I explained that I wanted to come in and recty it and that the police were sitting outsideneeded, but he handed me a Notice of Intended Civil Recovery.” The notice explained that Tesco’s solicitors could write to Maggie to recover the costs of investigating the incident, and there was further punishment in store. “They said I was barred for a year.

The day before I’d spent pound and the day before that I’d spent pound. “It was all kept in the public eye, they didn’t take me into a room or anything. I didn’t care though, because I was doing the right thing. “Where is their compassion, their humanity  Especially at a time like this.

Aodhan Curran often draws sketches of people, both living and deceased. Families of those who have received one of Aodhans drawings say that it has brought them great comfort.

He said the family were very thankful of the gesture. googletag.cmd.push “It is only a small thing but I think many of the families affected will get some comfort from it,” he said. Aodhan, who lives at Jacqueline Way in Derry, said he had always been interested in art. “I am studying to be a technology and design teacher at Ulster University in Coleraine but I have always loved art and doing sketches. “Over the years, I have done loads of drawings of people. “My uncle, Robbie Kennelly, died a few years ago and I did a drawing of him after he passed away. “His we, my aunt Margo, says the drawing is so special for her and it is lovely to hear that. googletag.cmd.push “From talking to other families, they love the sketches I have done for them and I just thought this would be a nice thing to do for some of the families of those who lose a loved one to coronavirus.” Aodhan said the circumstances surrounding the virus made it particularly dficult for families. “The people who area very ill with the virus are in the hospital on their own and then often die without their family being present. “And then there is the funeral service at which only a small number of people can attend. “It is a very dficult process for families to go through and many more will have to experience it over the next few weeks and months. “If my drawings can bring families even a small bit of comfort then I will be more than happy to help.” Any families who would like to contact Aodhan, can get in touch with him through his Facebook page Aodhan Curran Art.

Aodhan Curran often draws sketches of people, both living and deceased. Families of those who have received one of Aodhans drawings say that it has brought them great comfort. As a result, the -year-old, who is currently studying to become a teacher, has offered to do a sketch of anyone who passes away from the virus. He has already been contacted by one family and within days of the person passing away, Aodhan had left the drawing at their home. He said the family were very thankful of the gesture. googletag.cmd.push “It is only a small thing but I think many of the families affected will get some comfort from it,” he said. Aodhan, who lives at Jacqueline Way in Derry, said he had always been interested in art. “I am studying to be a technology and design teacher at Ulster University in Coleraine but I have always loved art and doing sketches. “Over the years, I have done loads of drawings of people. “My uncle, Robbie Kennelly, died a few years ago and I did a drawing of him after he passed away. “His we, my aunt Margo, says the drawing is so special for her and it is lovely to hear that. googletag.cmd.push “From talking to other families, they love the sketches I have done for them and I just thought this would be a nice thing to do for some of the families of those who lose a loved one to coronavirus.” Aodhan said the circumstances surrounding the virus made it particularly dficult for families. “The people who area very ill with the virus are in the hospital on their own and then often die without their family being present. “And then there is the funeral service at which only a small number of people can attend. “It is a very dficult process for families to go through and many more will have to experience it over the next few weeks and months. “If my drawings can bring families even a small bit of comfort then I will be more than happy to help.” Any families who would like to contact Aodhan, can get in touch with him through his Facebook page Aodhan Curran Art.

Even in defeat, it was Derry who stole the show. What was supposed to be a Sunday stroll for Offaly turned out to be nothing of the sort as Derry flew the underdog flag with real pride. At the midpoint of the second half, Derry were level and pressing, and it took a strong finish by the overwhelming favourites to earn a six-point cushion at the end. Offaly’s manager, Pat Fleury, readily admitted that his team would have to make enormous improvements before the semi-final against Cork. googletag.cmd.push The truth is, Derry were always in contention in this game despite the dire predictions of a massacre. Geoffrey McGonigle ed from suspension to rattle in two goals and the full forward line of Gary Biggs, Michael Collins and John O’Dwyer scored - among them. There were high-class performances at midfield from Ronan McCloskey and Oliver Collins, and at the back, Derry held both John Troy and Gary Hannfy scoreless. We came down here to win, said manager Kevin McNaughton. We know we are not that far away and I always thought we were in with a chance, we were hurling so well. googletag.cmd.push There was the feeling throughout the first half that Offaly always had the upper hand, but once McGonigle pounced for goals in the final quarter, the complexion of the contest changed. Brian Whelahan had been left out of the starting lineup due to a hamstring strain, but he was quickly pitched into service to shore up a leaky defense, and Joe Errity was also sent into the action. Their presence had the desired effect as Derry managed only two scores in the closing stages, while Offaly had five points and a vital goal by Brendan Murphy. Derry were five points in arrears at the changeover, but they had the advantage of the breeze to come. McGonigle got the first of his goals when he latched on to Kieran McKeever’s probing delivery, and then when Stephen Byrne made a save from John O’Dwyer’s shot, McGonigle was perfectly positioned to dispatch the rebound. We put in a hell of a performance, said Ollie Collins, who was forced out with injury during the second half. This our first time down here. I’m certain this team will be back at this stage of the competition and go better.

No matter where you go or who you are talking to up and down the country, they always ask about Roly. There is always someone who knows him or has played with or against him.The above paragraph was taken word for word from Drumaness Millsrsquos th anniversary booklet in . It captures brilliantly the essence of Roly lsquoThe Manrsquo.Roly died on Wednesday, March , sparking a deluge of tributes on social media. True gentleman, one in a million, what a lovely man, one and only Roly, top man, a legend mdash these tributes, among many others, appeared again and again.Roly was an integral part of village le in Drumaness, dandering to the bookies or the shop. He would make multiple stops to say hello to everyone he met, discussing the issues of the day.I have known him for a!most  years. He worked in Sam Bellrsquos egg factory across the road from St Josephrsquos Primary School in Crossgar. The workers would kick a ball about the road during their break and even to my untrained eye he was dferent class. It was my introduction to Roly lsquoThe Footballerrsquo.Some years later Roly and his brother, John, knocked on our door in Crossgar. They wanted me to play for the Mills in the Newcastle Summer League and I was more than happy to do so.Playing with Roly was a great education for a young player. He made football look easy, was stylish and talented, possessing the rare gt of keeping the game simple.Small wonder then that when talk comes around to the Millsrsquo greatest ever player, Roly is always in the conversation, despite competition from the likes of Robbie Strain, Osie Gelston, Conor Walsh and Davy Mills.Legend has it that in those days boys were born with boots on in Drumaness because this was a village where sport was king. So it was that Roly also excelled at billiards and cricket, reaching a very high standard in both.But football and the Mills were Rolyrsquos first loves and he rarely missed training or matches. Inevitably his talent came to the notice of Irish League managers and he enjoyed spells with Portadown and Cltonville in the early seventies. Nevertheless, Roly was a home bird and sooner or later he would pull on the Mills shirt again.By now I was playing for the all conquering Downpatrick Rec team of that era and we pitched up to a Border Cup final early in  to play the Mills. We had just won the Steel and Sons Cup and had our eyes firmly on the double, but Roly and Osie Gelston had other plans and proceeded to inspire the Mills to a famous - win.Roly had reached the twilight years of a glorious footballing career, but there was still time to lead the Mills reserves to another giant-killing act, beating Castlewellan in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final in .After such a stellar playing career, Roly was expected to become a manager. He did dip his toes in the managerial waters once or twice, but with no offence intended to the managerial fraternity mdash myself included mdash Roly was probably too nice to be a manager. In all the years I have known him I canrsquot remember him raising his voice. He was just so easy going, decent and level-headed.As a result people liked Roly and this popularity unsurprisingly proved to be an asset in his working le. After Sam Bells he spent a number of years working in the Co-Op shop in Drumaness before taking up employment with well-known butcher Vincy Doran.He was a familiar sight in Vincyrsquos van, delivering to hotels and restaurants, but it was his weekend door-to-door run which played to his strengths and further cemented his popularity.He became known as Butch or Butcher mdash a nickname he loved mdash and Vincy to this day has nothing but good things to say about Rolyrsquos eight-year stint with him.Rolyrsquos next stop was with Jimmy Quinn, who owned a bakery in Downpatrick. Jimmy shrewdly ed Roly to the door-to-door market and with people still finding it dficult to say no to the personable Roly, their successful liaison continued for  years.Jimmy likes nothing better than relating Roly stories,none of which can be repeated here, and like the rest of us he will remember Roly with the utmost fondness.Unfortunately Roly wasnrsquot immune to the ups and downs of le and deteriorating health curtailed his working le. He managed to fight and beat prostrate cancer a number of years ago, but this time around the lsquoBig Crsquo has claimed this lovely man.Ironically it was during these latter years that he seemed to be ever present on the streets of Drumaness, allowing him to befriend a generation entirely unaware of his past sporting prowess.Roly married Betty Rice on October , , and together they brought Noel, Pauline, Betty, Carol and Christine into the world. After almost  years together as a couple they remained best friends, as well as husband and we.Apart from my football connection to Roly, I have been his neighbour for  years and since his passing I have heard him described as lsquoMr Drumaness Millsrsquo, but for me he was Mr Drumaness full stop. This village will never be the same without him.Rolyrsquos family should be immensely proud of his impact on those who knew him and how sad it was to see coronavirus rob them and Roly of the fitting send-off he deserved.However, the good news is that I know there are plans afoot to have a celebration of his le when normality s. Nobody deserves it more. RIP Roly.Roly Hanna -.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Cormac.jpg","title":"Ardglass golfer on teeing up with the best in the world  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin could be forgiven for feeling understandably frustrated right now.The richly talented  year-old should be locking horns with some of the worldrsquos best players on the European tour.But instead of prowling the fairways hersquos holed up in his apartment in Dublin mdash like many others undergoing coronavirus lockdown.Itrsquos not how Sharvin, currently th in golfrsquos world rankings, thought his first season on the European Tour would go.Having secured his card for the  season by finishing th on the  Challenge Tour rankings, he was gearing up for a potential breakthrough campaign on the top circuit.However, after just four events, he is unsure of what the future holds as the sporting world goes into shutdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.He clearly appreciated that golf, and sport in general, is of minor importance when compared with the COVID pandemic.Of the decision to close all golf courses north and south of the border, he told the BBC recently: ldquoItrsquos a precaution that needs to be in place.I donrsquot know enough about the virus, but theyrsquore obviously trying to slow things down. Hopefully wersquoll be back playing as soon as possible, I think thatrsquos the goal.ldquoI think we just have to accept it and sit tight and when it does pass, we can get things moving a bit quicker.Certainly things have happened fairly quickly for Sharvin in his career to date. He only took up golf seriously relatively late in his teenage years, but went on to have glittering amateur career.In  he was a member of the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, contributing three points and remaining unbeaten in a .-. thumping of the United States.Sharvin turned  the following year and joined the ranks of the European Challenge Tour.Having missed his European Tour card by a single shot in , Sharvin relocated to Dublin and It proved to be the right move.He amassed eight top ten finishes in  starts to earn a rookie season on the European Tour thanks in large part to his six top fives.Sharvin only missed four cuts, two of which came in the first two events of the season, before he kickstarted his campaign with back-to-back top ten finishes.However, his best performance came at the Irish Open at Lahinch where he finished tied for th and was also the leading Irish golfer.He showed impressive consistency during the  season and proved his elite-level credentials with a tie for th finish at the Irish Open, ending the week as the leading home competitor.He says: I had a really good year, I put myself into contention a lot which was great. I think I was ready to take that step and I think the way I played, I deserved to get my card in the end with a few good results.ldquoI also managed to play well in a couple of European Tour events as well which showed me that I was ready to take that step. Therersquos a relief that I have my card now but itrsquos only the start of it mdash I know I have to keep improving and moving up the rankings.At the Irish Open he finished ahead of future Open champion Shane Lowry, Ryder Cup star Tommy Fleetwood former world number one Lee Westwood and Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington.ldquoIt was disappointing to shoot level-par on Sunday, but I feel like I didnrsquot do much wrong, he said.ldquoIt was really nice to have that pressure of going into the final round of a big European Tour event with a chance to win. It showed me where I was mentally and physically, that I was able to come from the Challenge Tour and compete in a top-level European Tour event.ldquoThat was an unbelievable week. The crowds were incredible and I attracted a big following being the leading Irishman, and that was a great feeling.ldquoItrsquos a nice feeling when hundreds of people are following you and everyone is willing your ball into the hole. I think that really geared me up quite a lot. It was a class buzz.ldquoIt was dficult going back to playing the Challenge Tour in the middle of nowhere in France the week after, but that week gave me the confidence to string together more good results to get off the Challenge Tour.Sharvin admits itrsquos been a slow start on the European Tour, with a tie for th in the Oman Open his bestin four starts this year, but his belief in being able to compete at the higher end of leaderboards remains undimmed.ldquoI feel like my game is good, but I havenrsquot really put all the facets together. ldquoI think in Oman I was second in strokes, gained tee-to-green and just putted really poorly. I played quite nicely in Qatar and just didnrsquot get it going.ldquoItrsquos obviously such a short period of time so itrsquos hard to assess in four events, but I feel like Irsquom close. This break may help me improve other things and hopefully Irsquom a better player when we start again.Given his Walker Cup experience, Sharvin would dearly love to play in the Ryder Cup in the years ahead.ldquoThe Ryder Cup would definitely be up there for me. I grew up playing team sports and have been involved with them my whole le, so that would be huge.ldquoI feel like Irsquom pretty good in a team and having tasted a little success in team sports, I think thatI can get my game to that level, Irsquod be a good asset in that sense..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch singer performs at nursing homes  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH man is serenading residents in local nursing and residential homes through the COVID- crisis with hit songs to remind them of happier times.The gesture from popular singer Wayne Rodgers is even more laudable as he lost all his work overnight in the lockdown as a driving instructor and a wedding band performer.The  year-old performed outside four homes on Monday, delighting the residents and carers in Redburn Nursing Home, Oakridge Care Home, Spa Nursing Home and Fishbourne House Care Home.Performing classic hits from artists such as Jim Reeves and Clf Richards, Wayne believes his singing is helping strike a chord with the elderly residents who need to be kept apart from family members at this time.ldquoThe singing helps the residents and it really helps me too as it passes the time for me as my work has had to stop due to the virus, said Wayne, who now lives in Bellaghy.ldquoIrsquove received photographs taken from the inside of the home showing residents enjoying my songs and itrsquos lovely to see. It can get really emotional as there are now family members turning up to wave and talk to their relatives through windows while I sing.ldquoItrsquos heartfelt to see their enjoyment at being able to connect with their parents or grandparents inside. It can be heart-breaking at times but itrsquos still nice to see it.ldquoI have been told by some of the carers that they have seen some patients with dementia sing along to the music and thatrsquos also really good to know.A former soloist with St Patrickrsquos Church in Ballynahinch and ex-pupil of St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College, Wayne ensures he keeps the residents and carers safe at all times.A long extension power lead from the home is laid for him before he arrives so he can plug in his mixing desk, microphone and laptop.Wayne said: ldquoItrsquos sterilised before I get it and when I had it back itrsquos sterilised again so I have no direct contact with anyone in the home.ldquoI try not to sing beyond  minutes as the homes often open the windows to allow residents to hear better and Irsquom conscious of not wanting anyone to get too cold in the process.Wayne started off singing at a Magherafelt nursing home when a pub owner hersquos friendly with was approached by the home asking for suggestions at how they could entertain the residents.He added: ldquoThe residents in the home loved it and asked me to come back again so I did and then I got calls from other homes.He now has nine performances under his belt with the help of his brother-in-law, former Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin, and his sister, Michelle, who runs Paddy Kellyrsquos Bar in Ballynahinch.Wayne, whose parents Maurice and Naveen still live in Ballynahinch, has been a show band singer for years and once performed with the legendary Sunshine.Gigs for his wedding band, The All Stars, have been cancelled or postponed as couples were force to rebook their wedding dates.Wayne is performing free of charge and says he is happy to as it gives him some focus in his le at this time.ldquoI donrsquot have much  to do as work has stopped, but I do feel a lot better knowing that Irsquom bringing some happiness to others, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Binmen.jpg","title":"Binmen receiving thank you messages for essential work  ","story":"THE districtrsquos binmen have been thanked for continuing to provide collection services during the coronavirus pandemic.Some people have been pasting messages on their bins thanking the men for the job they are doing, while their efforts have also been commended by Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey.Working in extremely dficult circumstances, the binmen are providing a critical service at this time and their efforts have not gone unnoticed by ratepayers who taking time to wipe the handles of their bins with disinfectant before they are collected to help keep refuse staff safe.Householders are also being reminded to ensure that they continue to place the correct waste in the right bin to help ease the burden on public health services to help stop additional risks to staff who are working under increasing pressure.Refuse collection staff have been singled out for particular praise as they collect and transport waste, with their work also helping to protect the environment.Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots said the materials refuse staff collect for processing such as cardboard, plastic and glass are vital resources in package production across the food and retail sectors, explaining that ain recycling could impact on the supply chain ing effectively.He added: ldquoAll those working in the waste sector are key workers and I have also established a COVID- Waste Group to provide support, guidance and regulatory direction to the waste sector.Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash which recently closed all its household recycling centres to redeploy staff to work in refuse collection mdash said that all bin collections continue as normal.However, residents are asked to provide additional help by ensuring that bins are put out for collection no later than am every morning or the night before.Where possible, residents are asked not to restrict bin lorry access and park as considerately as possible. Over recent weeks, binmen have experienced issues accessing homes in a number of areas including Ballynahinch and Newcastle to collect bins.Residents are also asked to ensure that all bin handles are cleaned or wiped-down before and after use and not to approach refuse staff without following the minimum two-metre social distancing guidance.Commending refuse staff for the work they are doing in dficult circumstances, the council chairman explained that as the coronavirus crisis unfolded, the local authority was quick to implement a number of health and safety measures to protect staff.He explained that the measures allowed bin collection teams to continue the service with minimal disruptions to residents.ldquoCrews now operate staggered start times between .am and am and are authorised to leave work immediately upon the completion of their rounds, said Cllr Casey.ldquoTo support social distancing, crews are restricted to one driver and one loader in each cab.

It is certainly a strange experience for me.I was ordained in  in Downpatrick. New technologies and new means of communication came after that, and Irsquove struggled ever since. So the recent experience of having to install web-cams at short notice into the three churches in my two parishes of Portaferry and Ballygalget, has been somewhat traumatic.This week is the holiest of weeks for Christians. The passion and death of Jesus is commemorated, in preparation for the resurrection on Easter Sunday. We celebrate this in ious ways. We might well ask ourselves what happened to Lent and how on earth do we celebrate what will seem like a lsquovirtualrsquo Easter Coronavirus suddenly intruded into our Lent, at close quarters, and changed everything.My mother still remembers the glow in the sky over Belfast, when from her home in Ballykinlar, she heard the planes over South Down on their way to blitz Belfast. No doubt her grandmother would have told stories of the terrible pandemic of Spanish Influenza just over a century ago.But my generation and that of my nieces and nephews have known little of such things and we experience this pandemic a grave threat.At the moment of writing, the streets of Portaferry and Downpatrick are entirely empty, as are the great cities of Rome, London and New York.The unexpected severity of lockdown leaves us feeling bewildered, disorientated, shell-shocked. We are acutely aware of the suffering around us mdash illness, hospitalisation, loneliness in sudden isolation. As schools close we are anxious about increased tension in family le. The loss of our work and leisure patterns, financial and employment worries.In the Old Testament Jobloses so much of what he had mdash health, family, possessions and friends mdash yet he refuses to rebel against God in his suffering. This is incredibly dficult for most of us. His attitude of acceptance of his suffering can be of help to us. He says: ldquoShall we receive the good at the hand of God, and not take the bad Jobrsquos story can be useful to us at present. If you can get a chance, read it.Lent mdash an old English word for spring mdash is more challenging this year than we ever expected. As we celebrate Holy Week here are two words that figure in the writings of Henri Nouwen, a Dutch spiritual writer, that I find useful.The first word is security. Where do we look in our lives for security. A basic human need  In success, popularity, money, friends, family, insurance and so on  We mightnrsquot think we do. We will always be influenced by them, but deep down they will never provide us with security.Many of those things are good in themselves, but spiritually, the only true security will be found in the everlasting love of the One who loved us first and who wishes to love us into and for all eternity. Job understood that mdash security.The second word is patience. Patience means a kind of ldquosuffering through the present. Itrsquos from the Latin, patior, which means to suffer. But being patient does not mean sitting back and doing nothing. It is not being passive. Having patience is not easy for us. How do we wait patiently for God this Holy Week, Easter and beyond during this world pandemic Being patient is an active waiting mdash it means a certain experience of suffering through the present moment. To let the seeds of our suffering be sown in the ground so as to grow later into healthy, strong plants.It means avoiding the dead-end of what could have been for the ability to pay attention to what is happening before our very eyes, paying attention to the people and world around us. By that patience, we can begin to catch a glimpse of the first rays of Godrsquos glorious coming.Last week, I personally saw those first rays when I witnessed the staff in a residential nursing home in Portaferry decide to live-in with the residents for as long as this emergency would last.This week I witnessed those first rays when a cousin, a retired doctor, rang me to tell me he was volunteering toto work to bolster the Health Service.In one way or another have we not all been privileged to witness the generosity of spirit, despite danger, of those carers, nurses, doctors, medics, ancillary staff and many others Might this not be for us another glimpse that helps us experience in our present circumstances that Christ is indeed risen and lives now among us  It certainly is a glimpse for me.The Old Testament reading for many of us on Sunday last was from Ezekiel. ldquoThe Lord says this: I am going to open your graves. I mean to raise you from your graves and lead you back to the soil of Israel. I shall put my spirit in you, and you will live, and will know that I, the Lord, have said and done this it is the Lord who speaks.The people of Ezekielrsquos time knew their frailty and experienced uncertainty as we do today. Their faith in God had been severely shaken. Could they start again Security, patience, maybe these two words might stay with us over the next while as the reason for the hope that we have I leave you with the words of a psalm, which St Patrick himself echoed in his own writings, his lsquoConfessionrsquo.The words encourage us to place our hope in the Son of God who will sustain and strengthen us in our days, the Son of God, Jesus, who knew what it was like to stumble and fall beneath the weight of the Cross. With these words I ask God to bless us and keep us safe:ldquoI waited, I waited for the Lord and He stooped down to me, He heard my cry. He drew me from the deadly pit, from the miry clay. He set my foot upon a rock, and made my footsteps firm.With security and patience we can put our trust in the fallen saviour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Huge.jpg","title":"Huge boost for foodbanks  ","story":"THE districtrsquos foodbanks have been provided with a pound, boost by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to help them respond to increasing need during the coronavirus pandemic.The funding has been provided via the local authorityrsquos community network and is one of a series of initiatives the local authority is spearheading to continue providing a range of frontline services and responding to the needs of the vulnerable and elderly in particular.This week, residents across the district have been thanked for adhering to advice to help stop the spread of coronavirus by staying indoors and keeping safe.And, as the Easter weekend approaches, council chief executive Marie Ward has appealed to people to continue to listen to the advice to stay at home and save lives.

","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm, a new report has revealed.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computermodelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.There is also the Phennick Cove marina located behind a breakwater mdash which could be extended mdash to the west of the main harbour which can accommodate up to  leisure craft and the inner harbour which dries out at low tide.The consultants say that the inner harbour is particularly useful for vessel maintenance but not utilised as extensively as the outer harbour due to limited water depth.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.The report suggests deepening the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.In addition, consideration is being given to creating a pontoon with so-called finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.Removal of the existing slipway at the southern end of the harbour adjacent to the beach is suggested as it is not generally used and considered too deep for access, with potential issues in relation to the removal of an area know as Church Rock to be investigated.Quay reclamation work is suggested between the north west corner of the existing finger pier at the ice plant and north western tip of the fish market quay.This would feature a new piled quay, backfilled and surfaced with a heavy duty concrete. Extending theof the quay wall by  metres is also suggested.The estimated cost of the harbour dredging is in the region of pound, with piling work and the new quay line and reclamation work estimated at poundm and poundm respectively.The breakwater extension is estimated at pound.m with the new pontoon facility estimated at pound,.The consultantsrsquo report makes it clear that the costings include primary construction elements but does not include licensing fees, site investigation, engineering design and tendering costs.Before anything happens, a marine licence is required for specic site investigation work, rock quality design and testing, sediment sampling of overburden, contamination testing and an environmental impact assessment.The regeneration jigsaw also requires detailed design work and planning approval ahead of tendering and construction.An economic appraisal may also be required.News of the proposed investment at Ardglass harbour comes after the portrsquos importance to the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy was highlighted during a recent meeting with Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots.He met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss planned improvement work at the harbour, with the politicians also highlighting the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure.They described Ardglass harbour as ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fishing fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed at the port.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran say further investment is ldquocritical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand to provide an economic boost, not only for the village but the wider area, and create new jobs..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Mourning.jpg","title":"Please stay in  ","story":"ldquoHE was my superman ndash the moving words from Loughinisland woman Maria Farrell whose father sadly lost his battle with COVID-.As her sister also lies in hospital fighting the virus, the mother-of-two has bravely spoken out to warn others not to be complacent about the deadly disease.Maria, who buried her father on Sunday, warned: ldquoIf you think you are exempt from this or you are immune to COVID-, you are barking up the wrong tree.ldquoMy dad went really quickly, hersquos tackled prostate cancer, heart attacks, falls, you name ithellip and hersquos bounced back.

He also highlighted the need for financial support for the southern relief road scheme in Newry.ldquoI fully understand that the roads minister has a lot on her plate and recognise that she is not responsible for the failure of her department to invest in any major road scheme in the local area over the past number of decades, he continued. ldquoThe bypass should be in place by now. Itrsquos potential for Ballynahinch and the wider South Down economy is immense.ldquoThe multi-million pound road scheme can rid Ballynahinch of its traffic nightmare, help rejuvenate the town and encourage more visitors into the district and wider Mournes area.South Down MP Chris Hazzard signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December  when hewas roads minister in a previous Executive.The by-pass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting that it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the by-pass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

I have been transported to a time that has changed my perception of le forever.People with CF have a faulty gene which means the mucus in their bodies is much thicker and stickier than in other people.They donrsquot catch viruses more easily than other people but when they do, it affects their lungs by causing inflammation and increasing the amount of the sticky mucus. This makes bacterial chest infections more likely, some of which are resistant to antibiotics, leading to a decline in lungwhich is the leading cause of death in people with CF.As parents, for the first sixth months of Lorcaacutenrsquos le we were consumed with the fear. We were advised not to visit baby groups, not to let people with colds into the house, not to take him to the supermarket on a weekend when it was busy, not to let him play in soil, wet sand, or day-old playdough as well as taking many, many more precautions to keep him safe.We also discovered that my mother-in-lawrsquos COPD and my fatherrsquos bronchiectasis meant that Lorcaacuten would always have to be careful around his beloved Nana and Grandad in case he caught an infection from them. For the same reason, he could never be within six feet of someone  with CF because of the risk of cross infection. My world would never mdash could never mdash be the same.We rarely left the house. I gave up my job in the RSPB and postponed my studies. Much of our time was taken up with the heavy burden of treatment for CF, including daily physiotherapy and antibiotics. I spent a lot of time campaigning for a cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi, to be made available on the NHS.And I cried a lot.Over the last three years, le has become more lsquonormalrsquo but beneath the joy of every milestone has been the fear of taking risks that could shorten Lorcaacutenrsquos le at any time.During this time we have learnt that there are some risks you need to take in order to be happy. Lorcaacuten began pre-school as well as swimming, gymnastics, and football classes and I resumed my studies and began working a few hours a week.There has been a lot of stress and sleepless nights, a lot of handwashing, and a lot of happiness. With the support of the public we won the campaign for Orkambi, a drug which can slow the decline in lungby up to % and can be taken by around half of people with CF. Lorcaacuten started taking it at the end of last December mdash the champagne was popped and finally we thought we could start to relax a little.Sadly it wasnrsquot for long. During the wait for Orkambi, Lorcaacutenrsquos lungs had become damaged, after catching a couple of colds in March, he ended up in the wonderful Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children for  days of IV antibiotics to treat a long standing chest infection.During those  days I watched the horrying news that COVID- was spreading. I grew ever more disturbed at the lack of action by the UK Government. How could our amazing health service, stripped bare by  years of austerity and cuts, possibly hold up under the strain of COVID- Lorcaacuten was moved to a room further away from other patients, masks appeared and I watched the eyes of the incredible staff in the hospital become more and more tense.With nearly every death I read that the patient was either elderly or had an underlying health condition. But why did that make it OK: Surely that made it worse  The message seemed to be that lsquoonlyrsquo the vulnerable were at risk but other peoplersquos lsquoonlyrsquo is my everything.As the days in hospital passed, I learned that the lung conditions of my son, mother-in-law, and father put them among the , in NI on the extremely vulnerable list. They would need to lsquoshieldrsquo for the next  weeks. Shielding means not leaving the house at all and having to rely on the government and the goodness of others to deliver medication and food to your door.When Lorcaacuten was able to leave the hospital, we arrived home mdash with great relief mdash to a lockdown. Once again, with no job to go to and my studies on hold, I am transported to those months of isolation three years ago.This time, however, it is dferent, because this time I have hope. For us, this too shall pass. We willto the normality so hard won in our lives. We, unlike so many others who will lose their lives, will have this as a memory to pass on. I let so much of Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy be marred by fear that I just canrsquot let it happen now. Every day I am thankful for my good fortune in a desperately unfair world. I am thankful for all the frontline workers and volunteers, for the Executive finally working together for the common good to sustain us and to protect the most vulnerable in society, for the kindness of people delivering food and medication to those most at risk.I am grateful to the other souls sitting in their homes feeling helpless and feeling like le is passing them by. But by feeling helpless we are helping more people have a le toto after this all ends.It will end but the world will never mdash can never mdash be the same and none of us will look at it in the same way either.Maybe it will be a world in which those who need support will begin to get it, a world in which our NHS will finally be built up rather than worn down, a world we protect rather than profit from. As I watch Lorcaacuten run happily and healthily around our safe home with his little sister, Saorla, I donrsquot feel fear for him. I feel fear for those putting their lives at risk for all of us, for those who will lose their lives and loved ones, and for those who are sitting in their homes feeling afraid.I often think that doing nothing is the hardest thing to do, but for the moment doing otherwise is a risk too great to take, for us all. If you can, embrace the cotton wool,only for a while..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Workload.jpg","title":"Workload up for Good Morning Down staff  ","story":"THE Good Morning Down charity which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district has increased the number of calls it makes as the coronavirus takes hold.Volunteers who work for highly acclaimed charity mdash now in its th year mdash have relocated from the organisationrsquos base at the Down Business Park in Downpatrick to their homes to ensure that the friendly voices people have come to rely on continue to be heard.Good Morning Down has also confirmed that in addition to increasing the number of calls that it makes, it has moved some people off the servicersquos waiting list in order that they can receive a call at this worrying time.Since it launch in , Good Morning Down has supported over  people with a wide range of disabilities and needs and the service it provides to people who live alone has never been more important.While there is concern among the senior citizens they contact and who have been advised to remain in doors for the foreseeable future, there is also great stoicism, with several able to recall hardships that they had to endure during World War Two.Staffed by  volunteers, the charity normally makes around  calls between Monday and Friday but the number has increased to help reassure elderly and vulnerable people that they are not alone.Relocating staff away from their main hub at Innovation House, the charity is unable to pick up any messages that may be left on the Good Morning Down answering machine.

In the main, he said they are relying on the television and radio.ldquoWe are letting them know what is happening and reinforcing the message to stay indoors and not let anyone into their home, even their own relatives. We are highlighting the importance of them doing all that they can not to catch the virus, the charity volunteer continued.ldquoPeople are very concerned at what is going on and many of those whom we contact used to get out to attend ious clubs but they have all closed due to the pandemic which means the elderly and vulnerable are spending even longer alone in their homes.Aidan also revealed that some who normally received only one call a week are now getting several more, with people brought off the waiting list so they can be contacted.He also revealed that the charity is also providing the people they contact with details about local shops which are providing a delivery service.ldquoWe are emphasising the hand hygiene message as much as we can and reminding people to stay indoors. We are also telling them to exercise social distancing and not let anyone into their homes, he said.ldquoWe are also telling those whom we contact not even to let one of their neighbours over the door as it is simply too risky. The people whom we contact are very concerned about what is going on but they are made of stern stuff.Aidan added: ldquoAll the volunteers are working hard to make sure we maintain contact with our clients, more regularly than in the past by increasing the number of calls we make to them.ldquoThe reward is how grateful they are for the service we provide and our main goal is do all we can to let them know that we are here for them and want them to keep safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/18336251.online-charity-concert-great-success-says-nathan/resources/images/11245101.jpg","title":"latest figures reveal island trend","story":"Latest statistics show that in the Fermanagh and Omagh District region the number of positive cases rose to  with a total of  positive cases across Northern Ireland.Health Minister, Robin Swann explained that there is likely to be a second surge of the virus later in the year: ldquoEven then, a reasonable worst case scenario would involve signicant loss of le in Northern Ireland.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The story of the Exodus from slavery in Egypt is told from generation to generation and the symbols of unleavened bread , wine and other items are are consumed as Jewish families recall the Ten Plagues, following positively by the Ten Commandments, and the crossing of the Red Sea followed by the crossing into the Promised Land .At its essence it is about the relationship between God and His people and how they experienced ine intervention and protection, most notably being spared the Destroyer or Angel of Death as it swept through Egypt killing every firstborn child and even animals after Pharoah refused to let the Hebrews go. The instruction was to daub blood from an unblemished lamb on the lintel and door posts of their homes thus when the Destroyer “passed over” the Israelites would escape the fate of the Egyptians, who had just previously tried to kill the first born Jewish babies.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Egypt had been ravished by pestilence and plagues galore and the country was devastated as a result. In the end the stubborn Pharaoh lets the people of Israel go. There are similarities with this classic story from the Bible and events today with the ‘plague’ of coronavirus and so many people having to stay in their homes till the danger has passed. We know in the end the final outcome was one of overcoming and redemption. We do hope for that too in the present situation which has come upon so many countries in almost ‘Biblical’ proportions.The Last Supper of Jesus which many Christians commemorate at this time of year was that same Passover meal that featured the unleavened bread and wine and the telling of God’s redemption from slavery through the shedding of the blood of the Passover lamb. The New Testament says, “Christ our ‘Passover’ was shed for us, therefore let us keep the Feast ” which the early Jewish Christians did to remember His death on this date. This was later changed to a day of the week rather than the actual date and so the two no longer link up, except for early Christians like St Patrick and other early pre-Roman churches. We can be mindful of these things this Passover, with both Jews and Christians in their homes while their places of worship remain closed. There is enough rich symbolism to satisfy both faiths. It may even bring some understanding between them as they both recall redemption and deliverance.Colin Nevin, Kosher chef, King Solomon Restaurant, Hilton Tel-Aviv, Israel -"},{"url":null,"title":" most popular dog breeds uks favourite dogs spaniels bulldogs and retrievers ","story":"People gathering at local beauty spots - PSNI ask public to ‘stay home’ and ‘save lives’Cars pack picturesque coastal venue - after government appeal for us to stay at home to save livesNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusNewsPeopleDogs : Other rd Party most popular dog breeds: the UK’s favourite dogs - from spaniels to bulldogs and retrieversWhen it comes to the most popular breed of dog, this is a topic always up for debate.

Until Saturday, he had never won the Irish Cup.He said: “I played in the final for the Reds versus the Crues in . We were beaten - by a Mark Dickson goal. That’s my actual cup final kit and runners-up medal used in the video we made.“The best I got domestically was a couple of runners-up in the league and I won a couple of Co Antrim Shields and played in Cltonville’s first ever win in Europe. I scored in two games against FC Dinaburg.”Asked who came up with the idea of holding an Irish Cup final in their back garden, Kieran said: “My two kids are football nuts. Keagan plays for Crumlin Star and Killian plays at Cltonville so my we Roisin is tormented by us. Our cup final was just a bit of fun.”He said he and his sons were missing football a lot but had come up with ways to fill the void: “It’s handy having a big garden to play in and great for kids but to be honest I’m old school. For me kids kicking a ball against a wall and doing keepy ups is the best practice.”Kieran, who works for a children’s charity – MACS NI – supporting children and young people, retired from playing last year at Crewe United where he linked up with his friends Eamon McCarthy and Ronan Scannell.He was also behind an Irish League Masters event in Larne last month which had to be cancelled. Over  former players were due to take part and it’s hoped the event can be rearranged during the summer.Meanwhile a number of Irish League stories have been circulating on Twitter.Gerry Flynn has continued to post daily stories. One of the funniest concerns a half-time team talk during which Coleraine manager Marty Quinn inadvertently booted a Jaffa Cake at Rory Hamill.Ex-Portadown player Alfie Stewart contributed the story of Marty Magee doing an impersonation of Ronnie McFaul with sock tie-ups as strands of hair.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away. For others who have been out for a little bit longer, they may need more of a refresher because, of course, its vital that we keep people safe, thats the whole point of the NHS.\"So the letter will go out today, well then be engaging inidually with all those who respond and I very much hope that many, many thousands will respond.\"From those Ive talked to, I think people can see just how important this is. The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Providing that people continue to be generous then there wonrsquot be a problem.As increasing numbers of people self-isolate to protect themselves from the virus, Claire said that the food bank was able to offer deliveriesnecessary.ldquoWe are a very open foodbank. If yoursquove got a need, just ask and we can do our best, said Claire.After the Church in Wales announced the suspension of public acts of worship, the Tabernacle and other churches in Penarth have been finding innovative ways to support their congregation.ldquoFrom this weekend we are going to be streaming virtual services, said Clair.ldquoOur musicians are recording pieces in their homes which will be shared online.ldquoAll our small groups meet on Zoom so wersquore in touch with our congregation.ldquoThe more elderly congregations are keeping in touch by phone and telephone to support them in every way ndash spiritually, emotionally and practically.ldquoThe epidemic is pulling everybody together and cutting across denominational boundaries.The Tabernacle Foodbank is open for donations and collections between am and pm Monday to Friday.You can also deliver donations to their collection point in Sainsburyrsquos on Windsor Road.The foodbank would particularly welcome tinned products, including curry, chilli, corned beef, and potatoes.For more information, visit: Info@tabspenarth or call:  . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves.

I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It runs past dozens of shops, cafes, restaurants and hostels, nearly all of which are closed.In ordinary times, tens of thousands of pilgrims from around the world retrace Jesusrsquos steps in the Holy Week leading up to Easter. But this year, flights are grounded and religious sites in the Holy Land are closed as authorities try to prevent the spread of the virus.James Joseph, a Christian pilgrim from Detroit, dubbed ldquothe Jesus guy because he wears robes and goes about barefoot, lives near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre year-round. On Friday morning he had the plaza outside to himself.He said Good Friday has special meaning this year: ldquoThe crucixion is the saddest thing possible, andfelt what we feel right now, he said. ldquoBut thanks be to God hellip He rose from the dead and changed the world on Easter. vw,vw,px, px\"Pope Francis attends a Mass for Holy Thursday inside St Peterrsquos Basilica at the Vatican In Rome, the torch-lit Way of the Cross procession at the Colosseum is a highlight of Holy Week, drawing large crowds of pilgrims, tourists and locals.

And he stressedthat those flouting public health advice have no right joining in the weekly applause for care workers. “Please don’t be tempted into letting down your guard over Easter. Our health and social care staff are relying on us all to keep doing the right thing. “The weekly Thursday night applause is so important and heartening, but it is not sufficient by itself. We have to keep following the social distancing restrictions. The vast majority of people are doing so, and I thank them for it. “But I am urging the small majority ignoring the restrictions to think again for the sake of themselves and their loved ones. Don’t be a hypocrite tonight by applauding care workers and then letting them down by your actions.” Mr Swann added: “The social distancing measures will stay in place for as long as they are needed and will be strengthened furtherrequired. “They are starting to make an impact. However, it is still early days and there will be many dficult weeks and months ahead.” The Minister concluded: “As we head into the Easter weekend, the message remains the same. Stay at home - do not go out unless it’s absolutely necessary. Keep your distanceyou do have to leave your home.
