The Center Party also criticized Rinne\u0027s leadership skills prior to a two-week strike by the country´s state-owned postal service Posti in November that spread to other industries, including the national flag carrier Finnair.       The 34-year-old minister and MP (left) has been tipped to become Finland\u0027s youngest prime minister ever and its third female government headRinne\u0027s resignation prompted the formal resignation of a coalition of the Social Democrats and the Center Party and three junior partners: the Greens, the Left Alliance and the Swedish People\u0027s Party of Finland.On Sunday, Social Democrats and the four other coalition parties said they are committed to the government program agreed upon after the April election and will continue in Marin\u0027s new government.

Institute of International Studies in California, pointed out the differences on Twitter         The test took place as a year-end deadline that Kim Jong-un set for Donald Trump to soften his stance and return to stalled nuclear talks looked set to expireHe did not say what the path would be, but observers have said it might include the launch of a space satellite, which would help North Korea demonstrate progress in its rocket capabilities without returning to overt military provocations, such as firing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).Some South Korean experts said North Korea may have tested a solid fuel rocket engine, which could allow it to field ICBMs that are easier to hide, faster to deploy and therefore harder to shoot down.\u0027They may well have tried to see the thrust and duration of a solid-propellant rocket engine for ICBMs,\u0027 a diplomatic source in Seoul told Reuters.\u0027That\u0027s effectively what they can do on the ground at this point without firing anything into the air.\u0027 Following the test, Trump warned Kim Jong-un on Sunday that he has \u0027everything\u0027 to lose if he does not rid his country of nuclear weapons.\u0027Kim Jong Un is too smart and has far too much to lose, everything actually, if he acts in a hostile way,\u0027 the president tweeted on Sunday.\u0027He signed a strong Denuclearization Agreement with me in Singapore.\u0027He does not want to void his special relationship with the President of the United States or interfere with the U.S. Presidential Election in November.\u0027North Korea, under the

has made two high-profile trips up a sacred mountain on horseback, a trip typically undertaken by members of the ruling family when important decisions need to be madeKim Dong-yub, a former South Korean Navy officer who teaches at Kyungnam University in Seoul, also said North Korea could have tested a solid fuel engine as it has been striving to shift from liquid fuel.North Korea appears to have used Soviet-era liquid propellants in all its ICBM or satellite launches in recent years, while developing solid fuel missiles to be fired from a submarine, officials and analysts say.In March 2016, state media said Kim oversaw a \u0027successful\u0027 test of a high-power solid-fuel rocket engine \u0027designed and manufactured in the Korean style\u0027.Kim also said the North\u0027s rocket industry had \u0027firmly transitioned\u0027 to solid fuel from liquid propellants, while inspecting a newly developed missile based on a submarine-launched ballistic missile in February 2017.\u0027It could be solid fuel or they might have developed a new engine,\u0027 said Jeong Han-beom, director of the Graduate School of National Security at Korea National Defense University.\u0027In any case, it\u0027s meant to improve their capabilities for ICBMs, which need to be tested several times, while sending a message to Washington that we might go back to those old

\u0027Given the price of the apartment, the fact that it was a new luxury development, and its situation in central London, it was so obvious as not to require express statement that the apartment would have a good quality internet service available in all rooms from the time he purchased it.\u0027 Mr Shalson says he had to resort to using his own 4G connection while starved of home internet, and his connection was so slow during the day he could not send or receive emails.\u0027As a result, until 14 October 2016, he had to travel to his brother\u0027s house in Hampstead to use the internet, or to an internet shop in Kings Cross,\u0027 said the barrister.He also made regular use of the library to get online.\u0027He paid £2.95m for this apartment in a brand new high luxury residential development and did not have any internet....This was not trivia,\u0027 he continued.Mr Shalson needed to access the web for \u0027all sorts of things\u0027, he added, including for key aspects of his personal and business life. Although now semi-retired, he relies on the internet for \u0027social, administrative and entertainment purposes\u0027 and states that his home was his \u0027primary internet resource\u0027.Mr Shalson, who says he also had problems using his mobile phone in the luxury block, says Heron confirmed before purchase that his flat would be \u0027wired for Sky TV and internet\u0027.         Mr Shalson, pictured outside Central London County Court, made his fortune in the travel industry But Heron Residences denies liability to compensate Mr Shalson, refuting his claim that \u0027cabling for data services\u0027 was part of a clause in the sale contract.It also denies that Mr Shalson was told through conveyancing solicitors that the apartment would be wired up or suggested to him that there would be quality broadband in all rooms.Having an internet connection from the time of purchase was \u0027not an outstanding obligation or provision in the contract of sale,\u0027 barrister Robert Bowker says in the written defence.And the fact that he had no internet service until the Hyperoptic cabling was installed in October 2016 was not a breach of clauses in the lease, he added.The case reached court in a pre-trial clash between his lawyers and The Heron\u0027s legal team, who were trying to block his claim going ahead, arguing that it is an \u0027abuse of the legal process\u0027.Mr Shalson, who bought his apartment on a long lease from Heron, is suing for alleged breaches of the contract of sale and lease, as well as under the Defective Premises Act.Mr Bowker claimed Mr Shalson\u0027s case was an abuse of process because several of the issues were previously dealt with in earlier litigation relating to payment of service charges.But Judge Richard Roberts said the internet claim now being fought was \u0027an entirely separate set of proceedings\u0027, adding: \u0027there has been no abuse of process here\u0027.The judge\u0027s ruling means Mr Shalson\u0027s case against his landlords can now go ahead with a full trial fixed for next year.         Mr Shalson is suing the freehold owners of the building, Heron Residences LLP, for £100,000, at Central London County Court (pictured), accusing them of breach of contract by failing to provide proper internet facilitiesMr Shalson\u0027s £97,300 claim is centred on compensation at £100 per day for no internet facilities, with part of it based on \u0027the time and cost incurred accessing alternative Internet facilities\u0027.But, asked by the judge how he arrived at this figure, Mr Shalson\u0027s barrister said: \u0027it\u0027s not a mathematical exercise, I accept that\u0027.\u0027It relies on factors which I have already identified: It\u0027s a luxurious and expensive new build development,\u0027 added Mr Goodkin.Due to the complexities of his claim, the judge directed there should also be expert evidence at trial about the alleged \u0027diminution in property value\u0027 during the time before the cabling was installed.Outside court, Mr Shalson said that he now has satisfactory internet access in the apartment, where he still lives, and is currently a more contented resident.\u0027It\u0027s a nice place,\u0027 he said simply."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/20/08/0E54F9B500000578-5411929-image-a-4_1519116182592.jpg","title":"Builder won 105m Lotto jackpot finishes customers jobs","story":"Share this articleBuilder who won £105million EuroMillions jackpot lugs boxes as he fulfils promise to go back to work and finish jobs – The Sun"},{"url":null,"title":"Earthquake strikes Tuscany damaging buildings sending people fleeing streets","story":"Share this article Schools in towns near the epicentre were closed as a precaution while experts checked for structural safety.Geologists noted that 100 years ago, a quake some 1,000 times more powerful struck the same area, killing 100 people.               The national geophysics agency said the strongest in a series of tremors was measured at magnitude 4.5 and struck at 4.37am local time.

He grew up in the American south and started his career as a travel writer, but when he moved to New York he discovered that words and sentences could not do justice to the streets he lived on.In the first instance, he has suggested, photography was a cheap surrogate for therapy, a way of slowing Manhattan down and forcing himself to look and find patterns in the apparently chaotic visual scene around him. He started to get a feel for odd coincidences in that chaos – moments when the background of street furniture and high rise and billboard and graffiti and traffic seemed to communicate directly with the people passing by: stripes on shirts that matched zebra crossings legs extending from bus shelters that made a comic tableau with adverts accidents of scale and serendipity that seemed like the fleeting work of an inspired choreographer.Among his favourite pictures in his book, Coincidences: New York By Chance, is this one of a “giant” walking past a billboard on 42nd Street. To Higbee’s delight, extensive Reddit threads and Instagram conversations have been devoted to theories of how the image is made. In the best of his photographs, as here, even when you understand the visual trick, your eye holds on to the illusion.Finding these images is slow work for Higbee. While he might spot the possibilities of a backdrop quite quickly, he watches and waits for hours for the ever-shifting cast in front of it to bring its ironies to life. He says he is lucky to add two images to his portfolio of the uncanny in a month.

Both sides suffered, and this is the strongest message in this soul-stirring account, which acknowledges all sides of the tragedy.Aivali starts and ends with the story of Antonis, named after the graphic novel’s creator (Soloup is his pen name), who took the ferry from Mytilene to Aivali in 2014 to better understand what his family left behind when they fled Turkey in 1922. But the bulk of the story is set in the past, built on real accounts of three refugees: Fotis Kontoglou and Elias Venezis, who were moved from Turkey to Greece, and Ahmet Yorulmaz, a Muslim who was sent to Turkey. Their words are visceral, ringing with the pain and stigma of forced displacement.Soloup’s black and white pen lines are simple and fragile, but the story behind them is anything but. A renowned political cartoonist in the Greek press, he adapts his cartoonish style to harmonise with the story’s solemn gravity. Even when he deviates from his usual style to adopt deeper, more detailed lines that are closer to a woodcarving than a comic illustration – in homage to Fotis, a notable woodcarver in his time – it never disrupts the flow of the narration.Current events loom over the book and Soloup makes the connection to Greece’s most recent refugee crisis. When he tells the real story of a Turkish soldier saving a Greek girl from being killed by his comrade in 1922, it is easy to see the same spirit in people today, as with Maritsa Mavrapidi, a Greek grandmother in Mytilene and former 1922 refugee herself who famously tended to Syrian refugee children when they arrived by boat in 2016. The Greeks and Turks endured being traded like chips in a card game nearly a century later, Aivali shows how this trauma has been carried through generations in Greece and Turkey, as well as highlighting the suffering of displaced people fleeing violence around the world today – including the 50,000 refugees currently scattered over the Greek mainland and islands.Soloup’s art and words offer a glimpse of the strength of the human spirit, showing how people on both sides of those waters were persecuted, yet also found the power to forgive and help each other. There is no hollow empathy found here. Soloup demonstrates how problematic it is when human beings are treated like statistics. Aivali doesn’t shy away from showing the complexity of human lives – on either side – and the ongoing struggle for some, still searching for a place to call home.• Aivali: A Story of Greeks and Turks in 1922 by Soloup, translated by Tom Papademetriou, is published by Somerset Hall Press."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c333ba55713a7c30a8ae0efc42ee6a16aaed9473/0_35_1532_919/master/1532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46dedbdab55754ad366cd45da30db334","title":"germany exposure journalist claas relotius","story":"The furore surrounding Der Spiegel journalist Claas Relotius is back, with a book by the colleague who exposed himFiction and non-fiction can feed off each other in unusual ways. In the winter of 2018, Germany was shaken by the biggest media scandal since the forged Hitler diaries, after it emerged that the country’s bastion of investigative journalism had published stories by a reporter who had “fictionalised” his prize-winning articles with armies of invented characters. Now the “Relotius scandal” has gone into its second round, with the publication of a non-fiction book by the journalist who exposed his fraudulent colleague: a detective story about the search for truth in the era of fake news that makes a more gripping read than most novelists could have managed.The plot of Juan Moreno’s Tausend Zeilen Lüge (A Thousand Lines of Lies) resembles that of the 2003 film Shattered Glass, about New Republic reporter Stephen Glass – a film that the young Der Spiegel journalist Claas Relotius was shown as a cautionary tale as part of his journalism degree. Claas Relotius was regarded as a likable colleague with a great talent for unearthing incredible stories from across the globe: a vivid inside account from a high-security prison in California the tale of how a boy’s graffiti started the war in Syria an exclusive interview with the parents of American football star Colin Kaepernick.But the scale of Relotius’s deception was more ambitious, and, for a while, more successful: before he was exposed, he had won the top prize for German reporters, the Reporterpreis, four times in six years. One judge praised his stories as jumping off the page “almost like literature”. He was in line for a promotion at Der Spiegel.What makes A Thousand Lines of Lies such a riveting read is that Moreno doesn’t present himself as an invisible arbiter of truth, but remains honest about his self doubts and the ego that drove his quest. The son of Andalusian migrants, Moreno writes how he sometimes feels like an imposter in the predominantly white world of German media. At Der Spiegel, he had found a niche “as a kind of expert on people with black hair”. Then came blond-haired Relotius, almost 15 years younger and a “high-performance Teuton”, kissed by the reporter gods.With such antagonists, it’s little surprise the book has firmly established itself in the bestseller charts, and a film adaptation is scheduled for 2021. The book’s integrity has so far survived a post-publication post-script: in October, Relotius’s lawyer announced he was suing Moreno over 22 instances of “considerable untruths and misrepresentations”. In one instance, he alleged, the author had described a scene which had never taken place. Two months later, Moreno says he is still waiting for Relotius’s lawyer to follow through with his threat. “All the time while writing this book I was expecting to be sued over it,” he told the . “So why would I have made stuff up? That is insane.”Describing his experience on the borderlands of fact and fiction, in the book Moreno writes: “You can make sense of the world at your writing desk, but then you leave the office and realise nothing is as simple as you imagined it to be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6495c12f0e3fdbf6916bca8d9b077b31fb144608/0_187_3630_2178/master/3630.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e501a40f9d0c36e9adef01480303135","title":"poem of the week the flea by john donne","story":"A ludicrous image of physical intimacy provides a suitor with a feeble wooing ruse – and us with sharp romantic comedyMark but this flea, and mark in this,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHow little that which thou deniest me is\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt sucked me first, and now sucks thee,And in this flea our two bloods mingled be\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThou know’st that this cannot be saidA sin, nor shame, nor loss of maidenhead,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspYet this enjoys before it woo,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAnd pampered swells with one blood made of two,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAnd this, alas, is more than we would do.Oh stay, three lives in one flea spare,Where we almost, nay more than married are.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThis flea is you and I, and thisOur marriage bed, and marriage temple is\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThough parents grudge, and you, we are met,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAnd cloistered in these living walls of jet.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThough use make you apt to kill me,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLet not to that, self-murder added be,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAnd sacrilege, three sins in killing three.Cruel and sudden, hast thou sincePurpled thy nail, in blood of innocence?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWherein could this flea guilty be,Except in that drop which it sucked from thee?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspYet thou triumph’st, and say\u0027st that thou\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFind’st not thy self, nor me the weaker now\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp ’Tis true then learn how false, fears be:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspJust so much honor, when thou yield’st to me,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWill waste, as this flea’s death took life from thee.This flea is a comical and complex figure. So is the speaker, a suitor well aware of the contrivance, exaggeration and contradiction of his ingenious but wobbly argument. From the moment he commands the woman in question to “mark …  How little that which thou deniest me is”, the reader has no doubt that the argument is one that the woman addressed will succeed in quashing – or rather squashing.The suitor’s vain quest is to persuade her that he’s asking nothing much of her, a thought amplified at the end of the poem, where he argues preposterously that the loss of her “honour” would be no more to her than the loss of blood incurred by the fleabite. Major issues are minimised, minor ones overblown. Donne’s “pampered” flea swells with importance as well as blood, and shortly approaches godhead, as represented in the Christian concept of the holy trinity, three persons in one God. You might think the poet imagines the creature as a God-sized penis. But Donne has the science of the day to some extent on his side: conception was thought to occur through the mingling of the blood of man and woman.This idea of blood-mingling impels him to greater heights of nonsense, when he declares: “This flea is you and I, and this  Our marriage bed, and marriage temple is.” The trio of overblown positive analogies (notice the “I” grandly substituting for the standard grammar of the accusative pronoun “me”) replaces the negatives – the sin, shame, and loss of maidenhead that were declared irrelevant to flea chemistry in the first stanza.The flea consolidates the union, and its shiny, armoured carapace, rather wonderfully evoked in the phrase “walls of jet”, provides the new marital home. Man and wife are “cloistered” inside the flea, the religious symbolism expanded in the choice of verb. Holy matrimony has become a flea-shaped cathedral.Towards the end of the second stanza, the speaker seems to shift identity. We can imagine the performative backdrop, the woman teasing the speaker as she tries to catch the flea. The suitor seizes the opportunity to foresee his own “death”, observing that “use make you apt to kill me” (“use” here means habit). He concocts a new absurd trinity, this time, the offences the woman will commit in killing him: murder, suicide and sacrilege.There is more than poetic justice in the consummation that of course we’ve guessed was coming. It happens between the end of stanza two and the beginning of three. The woman has crushed the flea, even in death a noble martyr: “Cruel and sudden, hast thou since  Purpled thy nail, in blood of innocence?” By turning this accusation into a question, Donne nicely maintains the comic pitch.While the woman doesn’t speak in the poem, her reported comment is so plain and sensible that we’re in no doubt she has won the argument. She is right in saying that the flea’s death has not made any difference to either of the blood donors. The suitor’s attempt to trump her argument is feeble, because the analogy is feeble: “Just so much honour, when thou yield’st to me,  Will waste, as this flea’s death took life from thee.”If the speaker had not steadily convinced us of his sense of his own absurdity, the poem would be less enjoyable. Donne was a young lawyer when he wrote it, and in building his case through exaggeration, he satirises both the ways of lawyers and the manners of suitor-poets.The movement of the argument is embodied in the structure, with those alternating tetrameter and pentameter lines depicting the contrast, perhaps, of great and small, physical and metaphysical, playfulness and mock solemnity. At first glance Donne’s analogy is adventurous, but he was adding to a solid tradition: Ovid and the medieval Latin poets had already made a lively connection between fleas and sexuality. A grim reality may underlie the playfulness. Fleas were a familiar, minor irritant but sometimes carried disease, including plague. They were ready symbols of the risks, as well as the pleasures, of proximity.• Smart Devices: 52 Poems from the  Poem of the Week, edited by Carol Rumens, is published by Carcanet.

Prosus argued that its bid was “the only one that delivers certainty in the face of undeniable industry change”.Just Eat said its board was studying the increased offer, and advised shareholders to take no action.The Prosus chief executive, Bob van Dijk, said: “We have had the opportunity to listen to the views of Just Eat shareholders, share our perspective on the global food delivery sector and reflect on the unquestionable challenges Just Eat faces, as clearly seen in its third quarter results.“We have also had extensive discussions with our own shareholders with regards to our long term strategy for food delivery and Just Eat’s role within that.”Takeaway insisted its all-share offer remains “far superior”. Jitse Groen, its chief executive, said: “A slightly higher derisory cash bid remains a derisory cash bid.”The board of Just Eat has continued to recommend the Dutch offer despite higher terms from Prosus.Just Eat shares closed at 777p on Friday, valuing the company at £5.3bn, and rose to 784.4p on Monday morning.Cat Rock, a top 10 Just Eat shareholder, is maintaining its backing for Takeaway’s bid, saying it would only support Prosus if its offer were raised to 925p a share.Alex Captain, Cat Rock’s founder and managing partner, said: “Prosus continues to dramatically undervalue Just Eat.“We think a Prosus cash bid needs to be at least five times 2020 consensus revenue, or 925p per share, in order to compete with a Takeaway merger that we believe could comfortably be worth 1,200p per share by the end of 2020.”Prosus became Europe’s biggest listed consumer internet firm when it floated on the Amsterdam stock exchange with a value of more than €100bn (£84bn) in September, and is controlled by Naspers, one of Africa’s most valuable companies.With growing competition from Uber Eats and Deliveroo, there have been a number of deals in the fast-growing online food delivery market.

The firm will be run by the chair, Dorothy Thompson, a former Drax boss, until a new chief executive is found, while Mark MacFarlane, its East Africa chief, becomes chief operating officer.Thompson said: “The board has been disappointed by the performance of Tullow’s business and now needs time to complete its thorough review of operations.”The company was founded in 1985 in Tullow, near Dublin, by Irish businessman Aidan Heavey, and was promoted to the FTSE 100 in 2007. Its shares reached a peak of £13.70 in 2012 but the oil market collapse led to the debt-laden firm’s ejection from the blue-chip index three years later.Heavey left last year and recently announced a new oil venture, Boru Energy.Tullow has been plagued by problems in Ghana, Uganda and Kenya. Demand for Jubilee field gas from the Ghana National Gas Company has been much lower than expected and Tullow has run into mechanical problems on two new wells at one its other fields. It also warned last month that two discoveries off the Guyana coast contained heavy crude oil, which cast doubts on their commercial viability.It expects to produce between 70,000 and 80,000 barrels of oil a day next year, down from about 87,000 barrels this year. From 2021 to 2023, it expects production to remain at 70,000 barrels a day.The company has suspended its idend and said it would be open to offers to acquire it “at the proper value.”Russ Mould, the investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, described the production downgrade as a “real disaster”.“You know an update is bad when it is accompanied by the immediate departure of senior management. The news represents a continuation of the problems which have dogged the company ever since its share price peaked more than seven years ago.“The company’s skillset was in exploration – it enjoyed notable discoveries in Ghana and Uganda in the mid-noughties – and it has clearly found the transition to being more of a producer and developer of hydrocarbons more difficult.”Mould noted that Tullow has debts of nearly $3bn (£2.3bn)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/faffea5546032caf41e5d4814b8cab91df8c087c/0_106_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc0df1ec2c5ede3c25e5f76384e91e4d","title":"pound high euro dollar election brexit eurozone markets business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as the Conservative party extends its lead over Labour to 14 pointsIn other news, the battle for takeaway company Just Eat rumbles on.Amsterdam-listed Prosus has hiked its offer for the FTSE 100 firm, to over £5bn, which rival bidder Takeaway has dismissed as ‘derisory’. Here’s the latest:Gambling site Betfair reports that the odds of a Conservative win have narrowed again today, to its lowest levels since 2017.When the Election was called in October, no overall majority was odds-on and the Tories had a battle on their hands according to punters, but once Nigel Farage announced his Brexit Party candidates would not oppose in Tory seats, Boris Johnson and his party have seen their odds continue to shorten to the point that today they look almost unbeatable.“But if there’s one thing that the last few years in British politics have taught us, is that nothing is ever certain and we will be watching those exit polls and first seats very closely when they come in on Thursday night.”Labour’s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has denied that the pound would plunge if his party forms the next government.Presenting his fiscal plans in London, McDonnell is asked what his plan is for a sterling crisis (something he said Labour was planning for back in 2017).McDonnell insists that there won’t be a run on the pound, claiming: My fear is that the pound will start to go up because of our investment plans.McDonnell adds that the markets realised that Boris Johnson’s promises are neither “truth nor implementable”.They are worried about instability, and very fearful about dropping off the edge within a year with a cliff-edge Brexit, he adds.Back to the pound.... and Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada points out that sterling has already largely priced in a Tory victory.That means there might not be much of a rally if Johnson wins a majority....and quite a tumble if he doesn’t.In another fillip for the eurozone economy, Germany has managed to grow its exports.Economists are encouraged by the pick-up in eurozone confidence this month:Just in: Eurozone economic confidence has jumped unexpectedly, in an encouraging signal for the European economy.That shows that fears of a euro-recession are easing investors’ expectations have hit their highest level since March 2018.The receding danger of a disorderly hard Brexit may be cheering Europe, along with hopes of a breakthrough in the US-China trade wars.Some stocks could rally if the Conservatives win Thursday’s election, given Labour’s commitment to nationalise parts of the utilities sector.But Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says Brexit uncertainty could still hold the market back:The pound nudged ahead to $1.3162 as the latest polls showed the Conservative Party extending its lead ahead of the General Election later this week. “The key question for investors is by how much UK shares could bounce on a Tory majority win. This scenario would remove various negative factors which have been weighing on markets such as Labour renationalising transport companies. Yet there is still Brexit to tackle which sustains some level of uncertainty among investors.”Elsewhere in the City, shares in oil producer Tullow are in freefall after announcing its CEO and exploration director had both resigned.The firm also suspended its idend, and admitted that oil production from two fields in Ghana will be rather lower than expected.Shares in UK focused companies are strengthening this morning too.This means the FTSE 100 has dipped by 10 points in early trading, to 7228.For all the talk of ‘getting Brexit done’, it’s inevitable that the issue would dominate UK politics in 2020 and beyond.If the UK does leave the EU by the end of January, a new battle to define the future trading relationship between the two sides will break out.Mujtaba Rahman, managing director at Eurasia Group, says Johnson will have some “very big decisions to make”, about how close to stick to European rules and regulations in return for less friction at the border.The size of any Conservative win would be a crucial factor here. A big majority would free Johnson from having to placate the hard-line Brexiteers on the back benches (and now in his cabinet too). Rahman says there’s little clarity about which way Johnson will pivot (if he remains as PM):Cabinet ministers admit privately they have barely discussed the future relationship question that would loom large once the UK had left the EU on 31 January. “All the focus has been on the election,” one minister said. “Boris is vague about the EU trade deal.”Whitehall officials believe Johnson would soon have to confront the dilemma May faced: to secure close to frictionless trade needed to protect UK business, he would have to accept more EU regulation than he has been prepared to admit.Johnson’s position is deliberately opaque. He is still in the “have cake and eat it” mode he outlined when May was PM. In effect, he has asked voters to take him on trust, and allow him to sort out the detail after “getting Brexit done.” He wants a “no tariffs, no quotas” deal with the EU but has not addressed the quid pro quo of regulatory alignment. He has avoided speaking about possible trade-offs in politically sensitive areas such as fishing rights, an inevitable EU demand. He has raised the prospect of a “buy British” policy and state aid for struggling UK companies, and largely avoided the EU’s demand for a level playing field. If he wins, he will have some very big decisions to make.Time would be very short. Johnson has argued that after securing a withdrawal agreement in three months, he can be confident of landing an EU trade deal by December 2020. An extension of up to two years, set out in the withdrawal agreement, would have to be approved by EU leaders at their summit next June. Brussels officials say December is an “extremely challenging” deadline and predict a trade agreement would take at least three years. Some UK ministers privately predict (and hope for) a fudge: a bare bones deal in some areas—with the details filled in later. There would be a mechanism to allow the UK to erge, with consequences for its EU market access.Another scenario—more likely if Johnson has a small majority—would be that the bare bones deal is as good as it got.Our morning briefing explains what the parties will be up to today:Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank has warned clients that the Conservative lead has been slightly whittled away in recent days:The weekend polls showed a wide spread of Tory leads from 6pts to 15pts but with the average edging back above 10pts after recently dipping below. A reminder that anything below a 6-7 point lead is around hung parliament territory.The closely-watched MRP opinion poll, released on Sunday, also gives the Conservatives a solid lead of Labour -- with a majority of 38.But... it comes with a warning that many voters are undecided, so that majority could yet evaporate.This chart shows how the pound has rallied against the euro in recent weeks, to this morning’s 31-month high.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.With three days until polling day, the City is growing increasingly confident that Boris Johnson is heading back to Downing Street with a healthy working majority.Fears of a hung parliament are receding, as the Conservative Party extends its sizeable lead in the opinion polls. This has lifted the pound to a new 31-month high against the euro this morning, touching €1.19 for the first time since May 2017 (just before the Tory’s lost their majority in a snap election).That would surely be enough to guarantee a Conservative majority, who could drive Boris Johnson’s Brexit bill through the Commons by January 31st.But elections are unpredictable beasts -- so traders could yet get a nasty shock after the polls close on Thursday night.Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada points out that undecided voters could still swing plenty of seats:There are two main possible outcomes for this week’s election which will shape the UK for possibly decades to come: (1) A Conservative majority government (exit from the EU at end-Jan on terms of Withdrawal Agreement and then still TBD, the free trade agreement that has to be negotiated by the end of the transition period) (2) A hung Parliament that would see a further delay to the UK’s EU exit and potentially a second referendum.Bookies odds show a Tory majority as a near certainty, in line with the steady gap in most (but not all) opinion polls. But there is a historically high number of undecided voters which could affect as many as 80 marginal seats. We will be neutral GBP going into Thursday and look to trade the outcome.The election campaign will continue today across the country, with Labour outlining its plans if it defies the polls and forms the next government....Asian stock markets have rallied overnight, after last Friday’s US jobs report came in much stronger than expected. Europe is likely to be subdued, though, having ended last week strongly.

We wake up in the night after replaying it in our dreams, worried about the mistake we might have made.Is it good to have emotionally disturbed people policing the internet? Maybe one day artificial intelligence will be able to spot nuance and context enough to differentiate between satire and hate, find a way to manage Dave and Doreen, and make judgment calls about when a victim is actually dead, but it’s not going to happen any time soon.Until then, you’re relying on a secret army in the shadows to protect your kids from perverts and extreme content. They’re not allowed to talk about their conditions or even identify themselves. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg makes proud public announcements about how many moderators there are, then dismisses their complaints as “a little overdramatic”.Facebook says it provides “wellness”, which meant invitations to finger painting and yoga, but try taking time off to take care of yourself when you have targets to meet and your boss is agitating because there’s a backlog in the child sexual abuse images queue. Someone has to take care of the innocents, it’s our job, but we can’t face it any more.So here we are, filing writs in the high court of Ireland – not simply seeking compensation but looking for respect. We need our part in your healthy internet to be recognised and valued, which means quantifying the harm done and paying the cost of making things right.Thanks to the tireless work of campaigners and lawyers in the UK and Ireland, content moderators are now being heard. Since going public I have heard countless stories of trauma and illness from people who were previously afraid to speak out. Nobody wants to be anonymous, nobody wants to be disposable. We took this job to make a difference. Now we understand we’re fighting Facebook as much as we’re fighting extreme content."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd663d2f5cbd6ca260f0f5805356fb39af3deef6/61_0_1768_1062/master/1768.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c1e158f003294d2276421daf58e014c","title":"why are people on tinder swiping right on kombucha and realness","story":"For all of the seemingly strange new online dating trends, mating in the 21st century is surprisingly similar to what it’s always beenIs irony or despair the best way to process the news that “real” was the most used word on Tinder bios in 2019? People are constructing advertisements for their hearts on a platform where their face will be viewed by thousands of people for the fraction of a second it takes to totally reject them. All the while, they say things like “I’m real,” or “I’m looking for something real” or “you better be real.”Tinder released a summary of all the data it collected from its users over the past year. And leaving out all of the creepy stuff it keeps tabs on – like, your exact location when you get horny for attention and affection, what you do on other apps like Facebook and Instagram, and the exact phrasing of your awkward attempts at flirting with strangers – and then sells to advertisers, it presented us with “The Year in Swipe: What 2019 Taught Us About the Future of Dating.”And what does it tell us about dating? Other than it’s a hell we all acknowledge but can’t seem to escape? The big revelations includes the fact that Generation Z – someone please come up with a better name for this – reference politics more than travel, probably because the generation includes those 24 or younger and most of them don’t have any money at the moment. Believing in something is free, after all. And people like to spell out their particular dietary preferences, with “kombucha,” “vegan,” and “avocado” all increasing in usage from the previous year.What that actually says about dating is that it is the same as it always was. People tend to date and mate with people who share the same political beliefs, so flashing AOC or RBG’s initials on your profile, a very popular thing to do in 2019, is just a quick way to weed out all the alt-right or Trump supporters in the sea of daters. If you do fight on your first date, if a message on the app leads to a date which it most likely won’t, it’s probably going to be about whether the Irishman was the most boring movie of the year. (“I don’t know, I think I lost consciousness for like an hour of it, nothing was happening.” “The Irishman is a profound study of a man’s inability to participate in the intimacy...” Date picks up their phone and starts texting.)People also tend to date people with similar socioeconomic backgrounds, and food has become an easy way to determine which class you belong to, without just announcing your salary to all other Tinder users. Kombucha is about five or six times the price of a can of soda, avocado prices have almost doubled over the past year, and vegans tend to be more financially affluent than meat eaters. Food preferences then become a kind of class signifier, a nicer way of saying “No poors, no fattys.” And I’ve seen language like that on the app a lot, but that will never make one of these surveys.In other words, people couple (or throuple or whatever poly people do) up in the same way they have for generations, the app simply changes the way that coupling looks. A much more entertaining, and illuminating, survey of Tinder data might be how people actually experience the app. How many people experience soul death when they log into their accounts, how many people have been sexually assaulted by people they met through the app, how the whole format of Tinder creates obstacles to commitment or intimacy, how many unsolicited dick pics and harassing messages and emotional abuse people have to wade through on their journey to love.But it’s the word “real” in an incredibly fake environment – where you know the vast majority of people are using face-tuned selfies and photos from when they were five years younger and outright deception in their bios – that gets to me. “Real” bios, “real” photos, “real” height if you’re a man, unless you really are tall and hot and fascinating, are only going to get you discarded faster.A few weeks after we met on Tinder, Nicolás told me a friend ran an intervention on his Tinder bio. He wasn’t getting much attention, and his wise female friend informed him that he was too honest about his belief in social justice, his experiences as an immigrant in the United States, his passion for soccer and jiu jitsu. He needed to tone it down. His profile, when I came across it, was much pared down. It kind of just said he liked coffee. He disclosed his height because that was frequently the first question women asked and he was tired of answering it over and over. He added a picture of himself with a cat.And it worked. Flattening himself out into a couple of pictures taken at a flattering angle and saying he liked a thing that everyone likes got him more responses, and it got him the first interaction that led to an actual date. “And it led to you and me,” he said. Because two weeks after we met on Tinder, we were wed.I didn’t have the heart to tell him at the time that I didn’t even read the part about him liking coffee. I thought he was hot, and I was looking for a one night stand and figured he would do. The fact that it worked out so well was due to all the ways that courtship has always worked: the mystery of chemistry, the discovery of shared values and political beliefs, and a love for David Fincher movies (always important for any relationship).Love is and always will be a great, big puzzle. No amount of data analysis will ever reveal the mystery at the heart of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9457a4e96c5a7572ba4e2c1fc4496d430e83a00e/0_892_5181_3108/master/5181.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8385101226b8861d6ceb95c729115787","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of bake","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘bake’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘bake’.Share your photos of what bake means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 11 December at 10am.

Seven hundred and five schools had more than two elements awarded a grade D, while 69 had more than 10.The data, which was obtained though freedom of information requests, were gathered through the Department for Education’s school condition data collection (CDC) programme, launched in early 2017. As part of the scheme, surveyors visited every government-maintained school in England to collect data about the physical condition of school buildings and how they are managed.The Department for Education (DfE) said that in some cases the documentation could have been held off-site by the multiacademy trust managing the school. However, a spokesperson for the National Education Union (NEU) said such paperwork was pointless if it was not held within the building it related to for staff to refer to.Critics said the findings pointed to a system in which overstretched school leaders were struggling to keep their buildings safe after years of budget cuts. Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the NEU, said the figures highlighted the effect of failure to invest in a crumbling educational infrastructure and that teachers, other staff and pupils deserved better.He added: “It makes no sense for important practical documents, required by law, not to be held on the premises of a school or college. The reason the government gives – that they may be held by a multi-academy trust would be laughable if it weren’t so serious. If they are missing how can the risk be safely managed?”Teachers across England told the  they were having to work in buildings so cold they had to keep their coats on, with damp walls and infestations of vermin. One teacher in a primary school in Teesside said she worked in a 26-year-old portable building with windows that would not open and others that would not close.“There is a horrendous cold draft, so I often have to sit with my coat on with the children coming in,” she said. “We had to shut for a week last year because of a massive rat infestation.”She helped to fix a leak in her classroom because the school could not afford to call a plumber. “I know the state of the school budget and I know that lots of schools in the area have faced restructuring and redundancies and I don’t want us to become one of them,” she added.Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said schools across the country were in dire need of repair, but the funding was not available. “That failure to invest has left our children and hard working school staff at risk, trying to teach in buildings that are crumbling around them,” she said. Labour has pledged to spend £7bn on repairs and upgrades to school buildings in England.The NAO estimated it would cost £6.7bn to bring existing school buildings up to a satisfactory standard, a figure that was expected to double over the course of five years to 2020-21.The issue of health and safety in schools was highlighted in July when the  revealed that nearly 700 had been referred to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) over concerns they were failing to safely manage asbestos in their buildings.Lucie Stephens has campaigned for asbestos to be removed from school buildings since her mother, Sue, a former teacher, died of the asbestos-caused cancer mesothelioma in 2016. She said the discovery that more than one in 10 schools did not have the legally required documents on site was horrifying.Stephens has launched a website that aims to show parents and pupils that schools contain asbestos, but has accused the DfE of a lack of transparency for refusing to release the necessary data. The HSE advises that asbestos is only a risk if it is disturbed or damaged, which releases fibres into the air.Responding to the findings, the schools minister Nick Gibb said: “The Conservative government provides money annually to improve the condition of school buildings. In this academic year, over £1bn has been made available. We also recently announced a £400m fund for schools to improve their buildings.“A Conservative majority government would build on that record with £14bn over the next three years, and by increasing the minimum level of per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f52bc403396f916b7120d92c74ce2bac05190ebd/0_351_5586_3352/master/5586.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d6be06b8e52daf4894e022e88c80bce","title":"avocados with edible coating to go on sale in europe for first time","story":"US technology allows fruits to stay ripe for twice as long and reduces plastic packagingAvocados that stay ripe for twice as long as usual thanks to an edible coating on their skin made from plant materials will go on sale in Europe for the first time this week.Large supermarket chains in Germany and Denmark will stock the fruit, which is treated with a tasteless coating that has the potential to reduce fresh fruit and vegetable waste throughout the supply chain and cut the use of plastic packaging.The groundbreaking technology was launched last year in the US, where it has helped to more than halve supermarkets’ waste of fresh produce including apples, asparaguses, limes and lemons.The technology, which was approved for use in the EU by the European commission in June, is already being tested in the UK by Asda. The supermarket chain is expected to launch UK consumer trials in 2020 after an experiment this autumn on mandarins from Peru and tests on cucumbers, which could dispense with the need for plastic wrapping.The initiative has been welcomed by the government’s food waste tsar, Ben Elliot, appointed last year to tackle the problem of 250m meals being thrown away in the UK each year.The spray-on coating, which was developed by Apeel Sciences, controls the two main factors that cause fresh produce to spoil the rate at which water escapes from the surface of fruit and vegetables, and the rate at which oxygen enters. This allows treated produce to stay fresh for longer.The food technology startup was founded in 2012 with a grant from the Bill \u0026amp Melinda Gates Foundation to help reduce food waste in developing countries without access to refrigeration, and now works with major exporters including Nature’s Pride to treat fresh produce.Food waste across Europe has reached 88m tonnes annually, at a cost of €143bn (£120bn). In German households, every eighth grocery item is thrown away which means that 6.7m tonnes of food end up in consumers’ bins.Kevin Patel, produce director at Asda, said: “We’re always looking at how we can reduce food waste at every stage in our supply chain. Having conducted an initial trial of the Apeel product earlier this year, we are currently gathering the trial results and agreeing next steps.”In a further step to reduce food waste, rival supermarket chain Morrisons is to offer customers free “wonky” carrots in an attempt to introduce children to large, misshapen and scarred vegetables after large numbers were harvested following the wet weather in October and November.More than 125,000 bags of carrots will be given away at the supermarket’s 493 stores from Saturday to help customers maintain the Christmas Eve tradition of leaving carrots out for Santa’s reindeers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8d4b5148e2ade4ed2e9be59e3d86beb410139fa/0_696_2448_1469/master/2448.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8e9db2817f9f0ac7e997577bae2200e","title":"boom in seahorse poaching spells bust for italy coastal habitats aoe","story":"Ocean species endangered as black market trade devastates marine life across Puglia regionEvery night, dozens of wooden boats loaded with fishing equipment pass under the Punta Penna bridge and into the protected waters of the Mar Piccolo, a unique saltwater lagoon in the southern Italian port city of Taranto.Trawling nets, cage traps and even homemade bombs are deployed into the moonlit waters by those in search of lucrative prey. “It’s like my father picking lemons and making limoncello at home,” says Luciano Manna, a local activist who has been monitoring the illegal activity for five years. “It’s too easy.”The lagoon is so rich in bioersity – with long-snouted seahorses, prized mussels, rare seaweeds, greater pipefish and loggerhead sea turtles among its native species – that marine biologists call it a “living eco-museum”.But an organised illegal wildlife trade with links to China is quietly devastating the Mar Piccolo and many other coastal habitats across the Puglia region, with experts warning that endangered marine species are being pushed to the brink of extinction.Michele Gristina, who works for Italy’s Institute for Coastal Marine Environment, has been studying the seahorses in Taranto for nearly 20 years. Once one of the largest concentrations in Europe, the seahorse population collapsed between 2016 and 2017. The only explanation, he says, is poaching.In November, five people said to “specialise in the use of explosive devices” were arrested by the Taranto coastguard in an operation that uncovered several kilograms of explosive material and TNT at the city’s mooring dock.The previous month the coastguard seized 228 plastic buckets of sea cucumbers – weighing four tonnes – hidden in cargo ready to be shipped to Greece from Brindisi, one of the region’s largest ports. “This was part of a bigger activity,” says Giorgio Castronuovo, commander of the Taranto coastguard, who is leading a criminal investigation into wildlife trafficking.“What we can say is that the Italian market does not have a demand for these species, so it must be international,” says Castronuovo. “Until a few years ago, there was no interest. When the demand started from abroad, fishing began.”Manna, through the Italian investigation website Veraleaks, uncovered evidence that in addition to formalised trafficking transactions the species are sold on the Chinese social media site WeChat, where products are advertised as coming from “Italy, the Mediterranean”. They are also sold by third-party sellers, who claim to offer “wild capture” through online retailer Amazon. Tencent, the owner of WeChat, said in a statement: “We are vigilant against unscrupulous parties making unauthorised use of our platforms and services to pursue illegal activities. We encourage users to report illegal and inappropriate activities.”A spokesperson for Amazon said: “All sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account. The product in question is no longer available.”Authorities say that local fishermen have close ties with Chinese traffickers who transport species of seahorses and sea cucumbers in huge numbers, by air or by sea, often passing through Greece on the way to south-east Asia. The practice, they say, is happening all along the Puglia coast at fishing villages and towns.The coastguard says that on the bottom rung, local fishermen receive about €0.80 (£0.70) per kilogram for sea cucumbers. For the middlemen who clean, prepare and store the creatures, the value increases to €7 a kilogram. By the time sea cucumbers enter the Chinese market, prices rocket to between $200 and $600 per kilogram. Seahorses can be worth $700 a kilogram in Asia at the end of the chain, according to the coastguard.In China many people believe seahorses are a powerful aphrodisiac. They are used in traditional medicine, to create a precious liqueur, or simply as ornaments. Sea cucumbers are consumed as food, or used for medicine and cosmetics.“It’s anarchy,” says Sergio Passarelli, a marine biologist at Mare per Sempre, an NGO that owns the only permit to scuba e in the Mar Piccolo. “From Taranto down to the Ionian Sea they fish everywhere there is sand, rocks and algae.”Campaigners say they have received threats from criminal groups and are concerned about the limited efforts by authorities to thwart the trade. “I have received warnings against my life for the work I do,” says Manna. “Fishermen unload wherever they want, the fish is not checked, but weighed and sold on the black market.”Rinaldo Melucci, the mayor of Taranto, says the authorities are doing all they can to tackle the problem. “The municipal administration will put any information from its current video surveillance system along the affected area at the disposal of the competent authority and is starting to strengthen this survey network, while at the same time preparing supplementary control services from the local police,” he says.There are about 40 species of seahorse in the world, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and more than a quarter are considered vulnerable or endangered. An additional 17 species, including both of those found in the Mar Piccolo – the Hippocampus guttulatus and Hippocampus hippocampus – cannot be reliably classified in terms of global-level risk and are therefore listed as “data deficient”.An estimated 37 million seahorses are caught each year, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora notes that they are threatened due to “overfishing and unsustainable trade”.Dr Miguel Correia, a Portugal-based collaborator with the international research institute Project Seahorse, who also carried out research in Taranto, warned that the trafficking network extends beyond Italy and across southern Europe. In 2017, Spanish police arrested traffickers in Cadiz in possession of more than 2,000 dried seahorses.“They are operating here in Portugal and other countries,” says Correia. “If it continues they could completely disappear.”This reporting was supported by the Internews Earth Journalism Network"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5866b79a48f850d7d8b4d86fbb9b8bfada3dda1/0_7_2126_1276/master/2126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4069181f725d6bb36bf7a7c92bfcbb22","title":"european shipping emissions in way of nations meeting paris climate targets","story":"Report says greenhouse gas emissions equal carbon footprint of a quarter of passenger carsGreenhouse gas emissions from shipping equal the carbon footprint of a quarter of passenger cars in Europe and stand in the way of countries reducing emissions and limiting runaway global heating, analysis reveals.Despite the scale of shipping emissions from both container and cruise ships, they are not part of emissions reduction targets made by countries as part of the Paris agreement on climate change.In France, Germany, UK, Spain, Sweden and Finland shipping emissions in 2018 were larger than the emissions from all the passenger cars registered in 10 or more of the largest cities in each country, according to the report published on Monday from Transport and Environment, a Brussels-based NGO.Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950sLyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API\u0026nbspwarned\u0026nbspthe industry: “Time is running out.”Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases.A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”.The Nasa scientist\u0026nbspJames Hansen testifies to the US Senate\u0026nbspthat “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”A\u0026nbspconfidential report\u0026nbspprepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states.Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies\u0026nbspestablish\u0026nbspthe Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions.Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research.Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”.At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out\u0026nbspan ad in The New York Times\u0026nbsptitled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC.The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose\u0026nbspmain donors\u0026nbspare in the oil and gas industry,\u0026nbspleads\u0026nbspthe “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which\u0026nbspends in disarray.A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals\u0026nbsp90 companies\u0026nbspare responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century.The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry.Exxon, Chevron and BP each\u0026nbspdonate at least $500,000\u0026nbspfor the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the\u0026nbspbiggest threat\u0026nbspto the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming.The shipping sector emitted about 139m tonnes of CO2 in 2018 – equal to CO2 from a quarter of Europe’s total passenger car fleet or 68m cars, the report, EU Shipping’s Climate Record, said.Since 2015, shipping companies have had to declare data on their emissions under the EU Monitoring, Reporting and Verification Regulation (MRV). T\u0026ampE’s report analyses the data and calculates that a container shipping operator has joined coal plants and Ryanair in the EU’s list of top 10 carbon emitters.The operator – the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) – moves consumer goods, ranging from electronics and fresh fruit to clothes and toys. It was responsible for about 11m tonnes of CO2 emissions, the report claims.Faig Abbasov, shipping manager at T\u0026ampE, who wrote the report, said: “A company that consumers have never heard of has joined the top 10 polluters list in Europe. This industry doesn’t pay a cent for its carbon emissions and the EU has so far done nothing to curb its damage. European trade doesn’t have to be dirty just because EU leaders have neglected to clean up shipping.”China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China\u0027s carbon footprint.\u0026nbspThe T\u0026ampE report said the EU had committed to “economy-wide” emissions reductions efforts by signing the Paris agreement. “However, shipping is currently the only sector not yet contributing to the EU’s emissions reduction targets and efforts,” it said.Shipping is provided with fossil fuel subsidies under EU law of €24bn (£20bn), as well as exemptions from taxes on tickets for passenger ships, VAT and corporate taxes. There are growing calls in the EU for the regulation of international shipping. The new president of the EU commission, Ursula von der Leyen, made extending the EU emissions trading scheme to maritime transport one of the top political priorities of her tenure.Abbasov said: “It’s high time national leaders support President Ursula von der Leyen and the European parliament in reining in long-ignored maritime emissions.“To make shipping do its fair share, Europe must bring shipping into its carbon market and mandate CO2 standards for all ships calling at its ports.”Since 2015, ships of more than 5,000 gross tonnage have had to report fuel consumption and associated CO2 emissions during voyages between the European Economic Area (EEA) ports.The T\u0026ampE analysis published on Monday examines the initial set of emissions reports from the data – giving for the first time a picture of shipping’s carbon footprint in Europe.The report calls for the EU to impose a CO2 levy on EU shipping and calls for the setting up of a European maritime climate fund to reinvest in the sector to help it reduce its carbon footprint.It also wants shipping emissions included in the EU’s 2030 reduction objective, as well as the upcoming EU 2050 decarbonisation target."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a722a067088468dde3b9e137ecc959487a0edf1/0_101_1748_1049/master/1748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64d31ed3e4ab6ebd49eae3fed89ee41e","title":"best thing i ate 2019 rick stein angela hartnett ruth rogers david gelb","story":"Eggs in Mexico City, pickles in New Delhi, king crab in Vancouver – chefs and cooks including Rick Stein, Clare Smyth and Angela Hartnett on the mouthfuls that made their yearRick Stein, chef and food writerMy friend John Illsley, who was the bass guitarist in Dire Straits, recommended that we go to Le Bistrot du Paradou. The first thing I liked was that there was no choice on the menu: just one starter, one main course, one pud, and cheese. The menu changed every day. No choice, a very lovely part of France, and two dishes that I just love: soupe au pistou and then chicken cooked on a rotisserie – and then I think it was lemon tart. Soupe au pistou is one of my favourite soups in the world. The first time I ever tasted basil was not in Italy but in France, in soup au pistou. This arrived in a big tureen, and gosh, was it good. It was in September, so all the ingredients were in season: courgettes, tomatoes, green beans, peas, basil, flageolets – and loads of garlic. The thing about food for me is it’s really an ancillary to great conversation and great atmosphere and that restaurant was buzzing, it was very nice to see John, and there was local rosé to drink. It all reinforced my belief that good food in restaurants is about the craic it’s sort of an art form that, when it works, has the effect of so cheering you up it takes you out of the everyday minute details and performs an artistic magic on you. But the soupe au pistou was just the best thing I’ve eaten for so long. Nisha Katona, founder and CEO, Mowgli Street FoodOver the summer I went to Vancouver, where there is an incredible Asian food scene. At the Dynasty Seafood Restaurant, which is the place for Chinese families in Vancouver to gather, I had deep-fried Alaskan king crab with salted duck-egg sauce. Salted duck-egg is kind of like the parmesan of the Far East it’s a phenomenal thing. They brine the eggs, steam them, then mash the yolks with butter, sugar, salt and rice wine, and so there’s this sweet, salty, quite granular coating that makes you actually want to suck the crab shells more than eat the flesh. It really hurts me that salted duck-egg sauce hasn’t made an impact in London, though I think its time is coming. We need to get behind salted duck-eggs. That sweet umami is the ultimate flavour hit. At Brat, we cook whole fish and crabs, so when we went to Hong Kong I was interested to see how they did it. This dish is a flower crab cooked in Shaoxing wine, it has chicken oil through it and comes with thick steamed noodles. You eat the crab and it creates its own sauce for the noodles. Flower crabs don’t really have the depth of flavour of the head meat of British native crabs it’s much sweeter and more delicate, but it worked. The balance was amazing. We also had a steamed grouper head with fermented chilli and Chinese pickled olives. It was kind of sticky and umami and spicy – these really complex flavours were so different to anything I’d tried before. I’d never been to Asia before, so it was quite an eye-opener. The Chairman is in the World’s 50 Best list, but it’s not fussy, it looks like a kind of restaurant you’re quite familiar with. They have a lazy susan on the table. I grew up with pretty rubbish food on lazy susans, but here the sharing element all made sense. It was an exciting place to eat. The Angel is a beautiful old pub in a village in west Yorkshire that’s been taken over by Michael Wignall, who was previously at the Latymer and Gidleigh Park. I knew it would be good but I wasn’t expecting it to be so incredible. He’s quite complicated in the way he cooks, but he makes it all work. The smoked eel and white chocolate was a standout, along with a strawberries, sweet pea and olive oil cake for dessert. They’ve just opened, so it’s early days, but the future is going to be huge for them. I finally got to Sweetings. I’d been meaning to go for years but when I’d been before they were full and I could never sit down. It was a gorgeous sunny day, and I tripped down the street thinking “ooh, this is going to be fun.” And it was just lovely. Lovely decor, shared tables, and nice old wait staff in waistcoats. I started with a black velvet in a tankard, standing at the bar. First we were given a little plate of pre-buttered sliced bread, which was quite a surprise. Then I had potted shrimps, then smoked haddock with poached egg. The service was great, and the hum all around. It’s quite City, quite blokey, and they’re all tucking in like crazy. There’s a real vim and vigour about it. And, I don’t want to be rude, the food was better than I thought it was going to be. I’d thought the food wasn’t really what you go for, but I really enjoyed it. It’s not modern, but you get why City men love it. The haddock and egg was perfect. A nice bit of frozen peas on the side – I love frozen peas. Then we had sticky toffee pudding and custard, and then Welsh rarebit with a bit of poire William. We rolled out after a good two and a half, three hours. It was one of those early midweek, naughty lunches, when you’re in high spirits right from the off. It felt like a real treat. Fozia Ismail , food anthropologist and cook, Arawelo Eats, BristolFor our 10th wedding anniversary we went to San Sebastián, which is lovely and has amazing food. But we also did a walk of about eight miles to a fishing village called Pasaia. It’s a beautiful coastal walk, but quite hard going – up and down – and when we got there we found this e bar, like a workers’ bar, full of old men drinking lots of coffee and smoking loads. They told us to take a ferry to the posher bit of the village. But we thought we’d just stay there because they had lovely wine, and we had the nicest tuna sandwich. It was on ciabatta-like bread really good quality tinned tuna with a mild pickled chilli and a green olive. So simple, so honest, so delicious. And it cost €2. We went back a couple of days later for another and the woman at the bar was lovely, but also like: “What are you doing? This is not a tourist place? What’s wrong with you?” It was hilarious, and still brilliant. Whenever my mum goes to Laos, she brings back amazing produce. In October, she came back with some very long, thin spring onions from the weekly organic market in the capital Vientiane – an incredible place, with loads of greens that I’ve never seen. I used the whole, unchopped spring onions, tail and all, to make a Korean pancake, or pajeon. I topped it off with some other produce my mum had brought back, including cherry tomatoes and some really fragrant holy basil, and served it with a dipping sauce of sesame oil, soy sauce, fresh ginger and chilli. It was the best pancake I’ve ever had because of those amazing spring onions. I lived in Mexico for four months this year, and I love the way Mexicans eat: they have a big breakfast and a late lunch and not very much in the evening. For breakfast, I would walk to a wonderful, really exceptional cafe called Niddo not far from my house, run by a woman called Karen Drijanski. Every day I would have eggs with tortillas and a rich tomato sauce with chilli, or Mexicanos, or rancheros. If friends were visiting for the first time I’d recommend they have chilaquiles – corn tortillas with either green or red sauce. Having that with really good coffee would start the day. I eat a lot of amazing food all over the world, so it’s very rare to actually be stopped by something. But at SingleThread I was, by the summer squash with black cod – it was outstanding. Some of the squash was cooked very lightly in salted water the fish was cooked on a little Japanese barbecue and had a light smoke to it and tama miso, which is an egg-yolk miso sauce, bound it all in richness. There was raw squash and blossoms too, so it was also very pure. Ridiculously good. The next day I was walking in the gardens with Kyle Connaughton, the chef and owner of SingleThread, and he said: “You know, these squashes are in my favourite dish at the moment”, so he knew that the produce was just absolutely at its peak. Robin Gill , chef-owner, the Dairy and Darby’s, both LondonOn a trip to Lisbon in March, I had Dénia prawns at a traditional restaurant in Cascais, half an hour west of the city. They prepare these monstrous red prawns very simply, just grilled over fire with a decent pinch of salt and some olive oil, and they were outrageously good. You suck the juices out of the heads and that intense flavour was like a freight train hitting me in the face. My wife and my friend Dan’s wife wouldn’t eat the heads, so and Dan and I managed to get double for our money. We had the prawns with some vinho verde, the super-light Portuguese wine – breakfast wine, I was calling it. When I went to Lisbon again in September, I went back to the restaurant twice, so I’ve had them three times this year. That’s how good they are. Andrew Wong, chef-owner, A Wong and Kym’s, both LondonBefore flying to New Delhi, where I’m a mentor at Baoshuan, I gave the chef a brief: “Make me some pickles.” And when I arrived after a nine-hour flight, Chef Sun put out this array of pickles: all cold dishes, Chinese dishes very traditional, but each one very different. Having been on a long flight, it was great to eat something healthy but so delicious. One was a lightly poached edamame bean with a spicy peanut-sesame dressing. Another was a traditional pickled chilli and black-bean cucumber. And he did this okra dish with a light dressing – just a little bit of vinegar, Sichuan pepper and sugar – but a weird texture. Traditionally, in most cuisines, they blanch okra in oil to stop you getting the slime, but Chef Sun explained that where he’s from in China they blanch it in water because they want the slime. And then there were French beans that he had blanched in a star anise stock it still looked like a simple raw bean, but so much flavour had infused into it. Utterly delicious. Chef Sun is from northern China but he’s been working in India for two years and he’s learned to use his roots, but pump everything with more umami because the Indian palate requires constant stimulation. We went to Singapore for a research trip combined with a family holiday and loads of people recommended Mr \u0026amp Mrs Mohgan’s. We were staying next door, so we went for breakfast pretty much every morning. It’s a tiny hawker stall that’s open from early until they sell out, normally about 9.30am. There’s a lady who writes every order by hand, then screams out the number when it’s ready. The roti came with an amazingly rich mutton curry dish, perfect for waking you up, especially in that humidity. But the roti itself was the star of the show: it was so crispy and buttery and flaky. I loved just watching them making roti after roti in the background. The entire meal cost about £2.30. You see people from all walks of life there, tourists and locals. For a barbecue programme, we had on the three best barbecuers in Britain: DJ BBQ (Christian Stevenson), Samantha Evans from Hang Fire Southern Kitchen, and Genevieve Taylor who’s written various books on barbecue. I’ve always been sceptical about barbecues but this was one of the most magnificent feasts of my life. One of the two dishes that Sam cooked was a Brazilian cut of beef called picanha we call it rump cover in this country but we don’t really much eat it as a steak. It was a big piece of beef, much thicker than a steak – about two or three inches thick – from a Hereford that had been dry-aged for 28 days. She barbecued it as whole chunk of meat, then sliced it and gave it a final two or three minutes on the barbecue, and served it with a ine chimichurri sauce. That’s a very simple thing, but it was utterly, completely wonderful. I’d been to Gatto Nero a few times before, but this was a new thing I’d tried. It was a langoustine, wrapped in lardo and then I think it was fried in a light batter, but it may have just been in flour. It was just so delicious. I was with my husband and another chef, and we all went: “Oh my God, isn’t that amazing.” When you taste something and you want another plate right away, you know they’re onto something good. Somni is a terrific restaurant by chef Aitor Zabala in collaboration with José Andrés. They do a tasting menu that is innovative but it doesn’t sacrifice that for yumminess. Sometimes when you go for a tasting menu, lots of dishes are more interesting than delicious. Millefeuille is normally a dessert in this case he makes it out of chicken. They do a chicken confit and then they roast the skin in a panini press. They layer this chicken skin and inside is chicken liver, Iberico ham, roasted onion puree, bacon Chantilly, rosemary powder and rosemary flowers. And it’s just awesome. As I was crunching through the layers of chicken skin I was getting it on my hands, because some of the filling was coming out a little bit, and I see Aitor across the room and he looks at me and smiles and does a kind of “yeah, you can lick your fingers” gesture. It was a pure, pleasurable moment of eating with your hands.Blanche Vaughan, cook and food writerMy friends took me here. Fowey is a centuries-old harbour town and the restaurant is in an old bank. We ordered a bunch of dishes. The first two were so standout – there was lamb sweetbreads with crown prince pumpkin and crisp sage, and pollock croquettes with aioli – I thought I had eaten the best things I would all night. But then we had a dish of braised celeriac with mushrooms and an egg yolk. The celeriac was sliced very thinly like handkerchiefpasta – fazzoletti. It had the same texture as freshly cooked pasta too, a silkiness with a really subtle bite. The celeriac was infused with mushroom flavour and it turns out they had braised the celeriac in a mushroom broth. The mushrooms had been foraged in a secret spot near Bodmin. When the egg yolk was stirred into the dish, it became this wonderful creamy emulsion. Florence Knight, chef and food writer, LondonNowadays, nine out of 10 chefs cook creme brulee in a bain-marie in the oven with milk, whole eggs and what have you. But traditionally it’s just cream, egg yolks and sugar cooked on the stove. It’s a lot harder to do, but creme brulee should be made like this, it should be decadent. David Hart, the chef at the Folkestone Wine Company does it this way. I do too but I have to say there is something he does that makes them so nice and light. His had a beautifully caramelised-crunchy top and a lovely, rich custard underneath. Everyone around the table agreed it was just fantastic. It didn’t last long, I don’t think it will be taken off the menu any time soon. In August, we went to San Sebastián for our first wedding anniversary. We first went on holiday there about six years ago. Tash, my wife, who does all of the pastry at the Fordwich Arms, is pregnant and this was our last chance to get away before the baby. We have an emotional attachment, it’s our place. We ate baby monkfish with crispy garlic at Casa Cámara, a family-run restaurant set into the side of the sea. There’s a lobster cage on a wheelie system that drops down into the ocean. They bring the fish roasted whole to the table, it’s incredible. The secret is in the emulsified oil with monkfish juice. I just came back from New Zealand where I stayed at Hapuku Lodge on the South Island. We weren’t expecting incredible food, because hotel food sometimes isn’t the best, but we were completely blown away by the chef Fiona Read. I had really bad laryngitis and her food was just so healing and comforting. She’s not trying to show off, but is just using whatever is available locally and it’s all really delicious. Every day we ate amazing food, but one dish stood out, which was brussels sprouts cooked with a lemon puree. She cooked them perfectly – the outer leaves were slightly charred and the insides were soft but still had bite – and they were served with caramelised lemons and some seeds. It was really simple but utterly compelling eating – like eating a plate of sweets, you just can’t stop.

There will be a crisp salad, sweet with ripe pears and sour with crunchy pickles a jewel-like salad of rice, herbs and pomegranates.The soup-stew can be made in advance and finished at the last minute. Its serving dish – a butter roasted pumpkin – can be eaten too. The pickles can, indeed must, be made a few weeks ahead and can be served as an accompaniment but I have also included them in a salad with ice-crisped sprouts and comice pears.Nothing will stop me eating the traditional plum pudding, for me the best bit of the feast, but I see every reason to have a few alternatives in store. Which is how I will end up with three desserts this year. A fruit laden pudding a hot puff pastry tart filled with apples and mincemeat and a festive ice-cream of crimson berries and honeyed nuts. In all, a glittering festive feast.A large pumpkin is a splendid sight on the Christmas table, but if that proves impossible then serve the glowing golden soup-stew in a big tureen or deep bowl, ladling it out into bowls. I find the easiest way to deal with the noodles is either to cut them into short lengths before adding them to the stew or to leave them long and lift them out with a pair of kitchen tongs.Peel the onions. Roughly chop two of them. Thinly slice the others. Warm the olive oil in a large pan set over a moderate heat, add the chopped onions and fry them for 15-20 minutes till soft and pale gold. Peel and thinly slice the garlic, then stir into the onions with the turmeric and continue cooking for a couple of minutes.Drain the chickpeas and haricots and stir into the fried onions together with the lentils and stock. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and leave to simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.Preheat the oven to 200Cgas mark 6. Melt 40g of the butter in a shallow pan, then add the reserved sliced onions and let them cook slowly, with the occasional stir, until they are a rich toffee brown. This will take a good half an hour, maybe longer.Cut a lid from the top of the pumpkin, then remove any seeds and fibres from within. Scrape away about a kilo of the flesh using a spoon, taking great care not to tear the skin and leaving plenty of flesh in place so the walls of the pumpkin are thick enough to hold the stew.Place the pumpkin on a baking tray, put the remaining 50g of butter into the hollow and bake for 30-40 minutes until the flesh is soft and tender. Occasionally baste the inside of the pumpkin with the pool of melted butter.Cut the reserved raw pumpkin flesh from the pumpkin into large, spoon-sized pieces and add to the simmering stew. As soon as the pumpkin turns translucent, (a matter of eight or 10 minutes) add the noodles. Wash the spinach, put it in a pan set over a medium heat, cover with a lid and leave it for three or four minutes until it has wilted. Turn occasionally with tongs. Remove the spinach and put it in a colander under cold running water until cool. Wring the moisture from the spinach then stir into the simmering stew. Roughly chop the parsley, coriander and mint leaves and stir most of them into the onions and beans.Carefully ladle the stew into the roasted pumpkin shell, trickle in the soured cream and add the remaining herbs and the fried sliced onions, then ladle into bowls.A couple of weeks before Christmas, I like to make a jar or two of crisp, bright pickles to slice through the richness of Christmas cooking. Not content for them to appear as an accompaniment, I often include them in a salad, tossing them with sweet fruit such as ripe pears and crisp greens such as shredded cabbage or brussels sprouts. This time I have used them with radishes to produce a salad that is hot, sweet, sour and crisp.You will need a medium-sized storage jar, sterilised with boiling water.Serves 6For the pickleswhite wine vinegar 480mlmalt vinegar 180mlwater 480mlallspice berries 10coriander seeds 2 tspblack peppercorns 15mustard seeds 1 tspstar anise 3sugar 2 tbspsea salt 2 tbspsmall shallots 250gsmall red beetroot 300gsmall turnips 250gFor the saladbrussels sprouts 150gpears 2 large, sweetradishes 12mooli or watermelon radish 150gPut the vinegars, water, allspice, coriander, peppercorns, mustard seeds, star anise, sugar and salt into a stainless steel saucepan and bring to the boil.Peel the shallots and cut them in half. Peel and trim the beetroot and cut into quarters. Now do the same with turnips, cutting them into similar size pieces as the beetroot. Put them all into a glass storage jar. Pour the hot pickling liquor over the vegetables then seal. Keep in a cool place for a week or so before using.To make the salad, trim and quarter the sprouts then leave them to soak for 20 minutes in iced water. Peel the pears, core them and cut into thin slices. Put them in a serving dish and splash with some of the pickling liquor to prevent the fruit discolouring. Trim and thinly slice the radishes and mooli. Toss the sprouts, radishes, mooli, pears and pickles together and serve.A substantial salad, especially one that can be made a few hours in advance, is an incredibly useful thing to have to hand at this time of year. To a pan of aromatic steamed basmati I have added some seasonal treasures, including pistachios and pomegranate seeds. I could have used toasted pine kernels and parsley, or toasted cashews and coriander leaves. The point is to use an equal volume of rice and fresh herbs, nuts and fruits as you might for a tabbouleh – so the salad is vibrant and fresh. You can make this an hour or two in advance but I would be tempted not to introduce the pomegranate until the last minute.Serves 6white basmati or other long grain rice 220gblack peppercorns 8bay leaves 2cardamom 6 podscucumber 170gpomegranate 1 medium shelled pistachios 60g mint 12 leavesparsley 15gdill 15ggolden sultanas 80gPut the rice into a large bowl, cover with warm water and rinse the rice by moving the grains around in the water with your fingers for a few seconds until the water appears milky. Drain away the water and repeat, twice, until the water is almost clear.Drain the rice and transfer to a medium-sized saucepan, add the whole peppercorns, bay leaves and cardamom pods, lightly cracked with a heavy weight so they open but the seeds remain intact. Cover the rice with the same volume of water and bring to the boil. Lower the heat, cover with a tight-fitting lid and leave to simmer for 10 minutes.Remove the pan from the heat and set aside for 10 minutes without removing the lid.Cut the cucumber in half, scrape out and discard the seeds and watery core, then cut the flesh into small cubes and put them in a mixing bowl. Remove the skin from the pomegranate and break into small clumps of seeds. Keep these in a separate small bowl. (If you add them too early they will send your salad pink.)Roughly chop the pistachios and add them to the cucumber. Pull the leaves from the mint and parsley stems. Chop the dill fronds and stems and toss with the cucumber and mint and parsley leaves.Lift the lid of the rice and run the tines of a fork through the rice to separate the grains, then add to the cucumber and toss everything together. Lastly, stir in the pomegranate seeds, mixing briefly, then serve.A straightforward bit of baking taking advantage of ready-made pastry and a couple of store-cupboard staples. It is essential that the apple puree isn’t too wet. Use very little water and stir regularly as the apple cooks, then leave in the fridge to chill thoroughly before using. I should add that this is almost as good the next day, for breakfast.You will need a baking sheet lined with baking parchment.Peel, core and roughly chop the apples then put them in a medium-sized saucepan with 4 tablespoons of water and bring to the boil. Lower the heat, partially cover with a lid and leave the apples to cook for 7-10 minutes until soft and fluffy. Remove from the heat and leave to cool before refrigerating.Set the oven at 220Cgas mark 7. On a lightly floured board, roll the pastry into two rectangles approximately 25cm x 32cm. Place one of the rectangles on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spread the mincemeat evenly over the surface of the pastry, leaving a 2cm margin around the edge the pastry.Spoon the stewed apple on top of the mincemeat, taking care not to include any juice. Spread the marmalade carefully over the apple. Break the egg into a small mixing bowl and beat lightly, then brush the edges of the pastry with the egg. Place the second sheet of pastry over the filling, pressing down firmly on the edges to seal them. Trim if necessary.Brush the surface of the pastry with the beaten egg then score deeply at 1cm intervals with a sharp knife. Scatter the poppy seeds then bake for about 35 minutes till golden brown. Allow to settle for 10 minutes or so before serving.A Christmas ice studded with nuts and fruit. The idea for which takes me back to the tutti frutti ices of my childhood. I have swapped the hideous glacé cherries for cranberries, and toasted walnuts in honey for a layer of crunchiness. I included a few crushed biscuits too, and suggest you choose coarse-textured, crisp but chewy biscuits rather than anything hard like a ginger nut. So, cookies really. You could of course make your own ice-cream, but frankly we have more than enough to do at this time of year, so I started with a base of very good commercial vanilla instead. It worked a treat.Serves 6-8cranberries 200g, fresh or frozen caster sugar 100gwater 125mlginger biscuits 75gwalnuts 60ghoney 2 tbspvanilla ice-cream 1.5 litresPut the cranberries in a small saucepan with the sugar and water and bring to the boil. As the sugar dissolves and the syrup thickens, the berries will start to burst. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. (If you’re in a hurry, tip the berries and syrup into a cold bowl and rest it in a basin of ice cubes, stirring regularly to let the heat escape.)Using a pestle and mortar or a plastic zip-lock bag and rolling pin, crush the biscuits to coarse crumbs. Put the walnuts in a shallow, non-stick pan and toast lightly over a moderate heat. As the nuts turn golden brown add the honey and leave, without stirring, for a minute or two, until they start to turn deep brown then remove from the heat and transfer to baking parchment or a lightly oiled baking tray.Take the ice-cream from the freezer and leave to soften. It must not melt. Transfer to a large, shallow freezer box or dish and trickle in the cranberries and their syrup.

Years of mere intermittent threats to Bayern Munich’s dominance have made Borussia Dortmund, Germany’s most visible other club and the champions’ most frequent irritants, the default opposition for a showpiece. More than 40 years have passed since Borussia Mönchengladbach were champions for a fifth and as yet final time, an era in which the mantle of top dogs was a real back-and-forth. In the 1970s, Gladbach’s first two titles and last three were split by a Bayern run of three in succession.It may be way too early to declare a similar state of suspense but something has changed, and not only because the last time Gladbach were top for this long was that 1976-77 season in which Jupp Heynckes, Rainer Bonhof, Allen Simonsen and company swept Die Fohlen to the Meisterschale. Bayern were here and worse at this time last year, trailing Dortmund by nine points. It does, however, feel “different” this time around, as Joshua Kimmich remarked in the corridors of Borussia-Park as Saturday evening drew in.It was hard to think any other way, or even to think at all, after this whirlwind of an occasion. This was the sort of afternoon on which Bayern’s motto of Mia San Mia – we are who we are – seems meaningful and not just a marketing buzzphrase. Whatever their issues in terms of leadership, personnel and team identity, they always show up for occasions such as this. Having arrived four points behind Gladbach they spent the first half pinning their hosts back, and it was exactly what we expected. Their dominance over Marco Rose’s team continued after the break, until the twists that turned this from an engrossing contest into something which felt even more significant.The sense of throwback lasted into the night as ZDF, whose Sportschau broadcasts free highlights on Saturday evenings, received a raft of complaints after the presenter Matthias Opdenhövel accidentally let the result slip before the programme started, not realising his microphone was on. The idea that, in late 2019 and with the ubiquity of social media, viewers can genuinely avoid the result of a Saturday afternoon fixture until the evening is a heartwarming one and fed into the feeling of this being a special day, the suspense of which should be fully embraced.Still, it was one of those rare matches that will continue to bear repeated viewing, even if you know what’s coming – a version of The Usual Suspects among football matches, if you like, offering finer detail and greater nuance on each watch. It was, improbably, Gladbach who ended triumphant after spending most of the match’s first hour hanging on. Their stirring comeback “left a whole region in jubilation”, as Westdeutsche Zeitung’s Achim Müller put it, and the celebrations were full of meaning, even if it’s too soon to talk about pivotal events.As fans in the Nord Kurve behind the goal celebrated with their delirious players Marcus Thuram, a pest for Bayern all afternoon who had won the late penalty which was the game’s decisive moment, wandered over to the corner flag, put Ramy Bensabaini’s shirt on it and waved it in triumph at the fans.The pair were both playing in France last season, Thuram’s efforts failing to keep Guingamp up while Bensabaini played his part in the Coupe de France triumph for Rennes. Here, in entirely another dimension of heat and adrenalin, they played crucial roles. Bensabaini’s towering header on the hour from Jonas Hofmann’s corner equalised Ivan Perisic’s opener and wrested his team back into the game. As stoppage time kicked in Thuram, a revelation in his debut Bundesliga season, improbably found another burst of pace to tear behind Bayern’s back line. Javi Martínez stretched and hauled him over, with the referee Marco Fritz pointing to the spot and showing Martínez a second yellow card.For Hansi Flick it was “just like last week against Leverkusen”, he told Sky. His team had played well but failed to take advantage. Both Kimmich and Neuer, meanwhile, talked about Bayern having dropped their intensity after they took the lead. “We deserved to take the lead,” said Kimmich, “but then we stopped playing brave football.” Gladbach, on the other hand, rode their luck on occasion but reaped the reward for their show of guts. Rose had thrown on the hero of last week, Embolo, for the midfielder László Bénes just before Bensabaini’s first, and never looked back. “After the equaliser we didn’t try just to manage the game, but to win it,” he said. “Thankfully, the game has two halves.”The question now becomes whether Gladbach – seven ahead of Bayern but just a single point in front of Leipzig – can do what Dortmund did not last year and maintain the gap until Christmas. That expectations on them have changed so much is more than just a pinch of nostalgia. It is a huge compliment to Rose and Gladbach, and a shot in the arm for the Bundesliga’s present.• Leipzig had been heading for the top until Bensabaini’s late intervention courtesy of a 3-1 win against Hoffenheim, which wasn’t quite as easy as it looked but Timo Werner took his personal tally to nine in the past five games. The striker also spoke of his aim to “take the momentum into the summer”, hoping to have more of an influence on Euro 2020 than he did in the World Cup.• It was a good weekend for Dortmund too, leapfrogging Bayern after sweeping aside a feeble Fortuna Düsseldorf 5-0. Playing in an all-black 110th anniversary kit – the limited run of 9,009 replicas sold out in three hours – there were two goals apiece for Marco Reus and Jadon Sancho in a fine tuneup for the Champions League meeting with Slavia Prague on Tuesday, with BVB needing to win and hoping for a favour from Barcelona.• Leverkusen are also in the mix, having followed up their win in Munich last weekend with a deserved victory against Schalke, a game they controlled from Lucas Alario’s early opener before wobbling in the last 10 minutes when Benito Raman pulled one back, straight after Alario’s second. “We didn’t just play good football,” said Peter Bosz. “We fought well, too.”• It’s on again at the bottom after Paderborn’s dramatic first away win of the season at Werder Bremen. The substitute Sven Michel’s goal was initially ruled out but then verified by VAR to move Steffen Baumgart’s team off the bottom and to within four points of the playoff place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/026c89568388207c9d1fdbad71ad9f888fba507c/31_7_2507_1504/master/2507.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=106677689f9f030885c27ff48df5880c","title":"premier league football ten talking points weekend action","story":"Aston Villa need more firepower, Tottenham’s front four are flying again and Manchester City have fallen behindThe difference between finishing 17th and 18th in the Premier League is often a striker who can score 10 goals a season. Aston Villa’s line is being led by Wesley, a £22m summer signing from Club Brugge. Thus far he has scored four goals in 16 Premier League appearances, the last coming more than two months ago. There is no doubting the Brazilian is short of confidence, not troubling Kasper Schmeichel on Sunday, but his hold-up play and lack of physicality must be a concern for Dean Smith whose reserve, Jonathan Kodjia, was deemed not worthy of replacing Wesley in Villa’s thrashing. Admittedly, Leicester’s defence is the best in the league but Jonny Evans and Caglar Soyuncu barely broke sweat. January is fast approaching and Smith will have to do some business to avoid the drop. Do nothing and Villa’s fate could be sealed quickly. Will UnwinBournemouth are likely to face Chelsea without any of their first‑choice back four after Nathan Aké sustained a hamstring injury against Liverpool. Bournemouth’s defensive frailties were exposed after Aké, who left the stadium on crutches, was forced off 10 minutes before the interval. Steve Cook will be out for several weeks after a hand operation, while Adam Smith and Charlie Daniels are also injured. To make matters worse, Callum Wilson was also withdrawn with a suspected hamstring problem, leaving Dominic Solanke as the only fit first-team striker with Joshua King also injured. Bournemouth are on a five‑match losing run and Eddie Howe said: “We have players missing through injury but one result can change everything and galvanise. I believe we are good enough but we need that result quickly.” Ben FisherA long season could take its toll on Nuno Espírito Santo and Wolves. The head coach knows his best XI and is keen on playing it in every game, with as few changes as possible – 11 Premier League games unbeaten prove it works. They have qualified from their Europa League group and are battling at the right end of the Premier League table but things are about to get more hectic as the pressure increases. There were signs of players switching off when Brighton scored twice in three minutes to turn the match around. Mental fatigue sets in quickly for players who are having to take concentration to new heights twice a week to keep Wolves at the desired level. It might be time for Nuno to have more faith in his squad – they are at home against Besiktas on Thursday – in order to achieve their long‑term aims. Will Unwin Duncan Ferguson was so caught up in the emotion of leading Everton to victory against Chelsea that Frank Lampard was among the many he kissed after the final whistle. He gave the Chelsea manager little else on an emotional day at Goodison Park, and Lampard was quietly seething at his team’s failure to match Everton’s physicality, as they succumbed to a third defeat in four league games. “They have to get used to it quickly,” he said. “You give them a tiny bit of room because of the youth of some of the team but at the same time they are not silly, they know that physical contact happens in games like this and we have to deal with it better.” As for the smacker from Ferguson, Lampard took it well. “I think he did, yes. But fair play, he was very in the moment and I understand how much passion he has for the club. I hate to lose but you have to give respect to someone like Duncan, because I am sure that meant a great deal to him.” Andy HunterWith Manchester City 14 points behind Liverpool after this defeat Pep Guardiola admitted that maybe the side who won the past two league titles and claimed a historic domestic treble have fallen behind. “United have the quality to defend and the quality to attack on the counterattack and you have to accept that is the level we face against United, Liverpool, Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Juventus,” Guardiola said. “That is the teams we have to face and the reality is maybe we are not able now to compete with them. So we have to improve and accept it and move forward. We are 14 points behind for the mistakes we have done, for the quality of our opponents and especially as well the things we cannot control. That is the reality but we have to continue. We are at the beginning of December and we have other competitions to play and other games to fight in.” Jamie JacksonManchester United’s transfer policy post-Sir Alex Ferguson has been at best opportunistic and at worst myopic. The most recent window, however, indicated a change in tack and a willingness to invest in heavily scouted young talent, particularly in the shape of Aaron Wan-Bissaka. He defends first and second, and attacks third, unlike many modern full-backs. His attitude, strength and pace all outdo his technical ability, but the number of one-on-one situations he wins is no fluke. His attacking threat is only likely to grow, given his stamina and ability to get into the right positions. United spent £50m on the full-back but his rapid development suggests he can be a constant in the United side for the next decade. Wan-Bissaka should end up being fantastic value for a hierarchy lacking praise in recent years. Will UnwinA combination of industrial action on Newcastle’s , the demands of Christmas shopping, a cold, wet afternoon and enduring disenchantment with the club’s owner, Mike Ashley, saw the crowd for Southampton’s visit drop to 42,303. That is the lowest at St James’ Park in the Premier League since November 2010, and 10,000 below capacity. The scores of empty grey plastic seats emphasised the shortfall. “We need to get St James’ Park full again,” said Steve Bruce, who advocated a cut in festive ticket prices. “It’s difficult for people to afford to come to the matches. Maybe the club has to try to help at this particular, difficult, time of year. Can they help our supporters when Christmas is coming? Maybe there’s something we can do to get the numbers back up. But the crowd that were here were terrific, they stayed with the team.” Louise TaylorWhile it would be wrong to get carried away by Tottenham’s start to life under José Mourinho – mainly because that is exactly what he wants – there is little doubt they have done well, especially against Burnley when Spurs delivered a stunning display capped off by a dazzling solo goal by Son Heung‑min. The hosts were well balanced and in tune, with the defence and two midfielders keeping their positions and looking to play sharp, forward passes to Lucas Moura, Dele Alli, Son and Harry Kane as quickly as possible. In turn they were devastating. Mourinho has clearly identified that quartet as being Tottenham’s principal strength, especially on the counter-attack. So long as they are fit, in form and well serviced, the team should thrive. Sachin NakraniIn the two games Hayden Mullins and Graham Stack were in charge of Watford, they managed to create a positive atmosphere around the squad and got some desire back into a side which has been lacking it for a long time. A narrow 2-0 defeat against Leicester and a hard‑fought home draw against Crystal Palace are not incredible feats but, considering what had gone before, the duo can be very proud of their efforts in a short period of time. Mullins says he is waiting to see if the new manager, Nigel Pearson, will keep the pair on the coaching staff but it could be a wise move to create some continuity at a club which has drifted. Having the energy and novel ideas of younger coaches alongside the assistant, Craig Shakespeare, could be Pearson’s smartest move to avoid more turbulence.

But a lavatorial eco revolution has now begunIf you’ve been to a festival, gone on a rural getaway or spent any time with eco-minded people in the past few years, you may have noticed a small revolution taking place in lavatories around the UK. For those to whom chucking litres of clean drinking water down the toilet on each flush seems wildly at odds with attempts to protect the environment and slow the climate emergency, compost toilets are increasingly making sense.The idea is simple: treat human waste just as other organic matter – in a not dissimilar way to how kitchen waste is composted.“The word waste doesn’t exist in nature,” says Fin Jordão, a biologist and compost toilet expert from the Centre for Alternative Technology in Powys, Wales, who has been one of the UK’s leading champions of the idea. “Waste is not a word fit for the 21st century and the ecological society we’re trying to build.”When Jordão (who uses the pronoun “they”) planted 70 trees on land around their house this autumn, they were fertilised with “humanure” from a compost loo. The liquid waste from the toilet and wash basin is piped to a reed bed, where it fertilises plants, such as comfrey, iris and marsh marigold. The solids, which are sprinkled with carbon-based material, such as sawdust or wood ash, cat litter or coconut coir, are collected in a bucket and emptied every few weeks on to a compost heap. Doesn’t it smell awful? No, says Jordão, “It smells like humus, like the forest floor. It’s that fungus, leafy smell.”Improved sanitation has saved millions of people from the threat of cholera, dysentery and numerous other diseases. The World Health Organization estimates that 2 billion people don’t have access to toilets or latrines, and more than 430,000 people die each year from diarrhoea caused by poor sanitation. Millions more die or suffer from other diseases and conditions, including intestinal worm infections and diseases that cause blindness. Clean, safe water treatment cannot be taken for granted.A recent article on the scholarly current affairs site JSTOR Daily described how before the development of an efficient sewer network in Europe, the streets overflowed with disease-ridden filth, because nobody could see the value in human compost. Europe’s arable land was rich and fertile. In Japan, by contrast, where land was less fertile, humanure or “night soil” was so highly valued that when the price soared disputes broke out over who had the right to collect it. In Osaka, writes Lina Zeldovich, where boats came to the city to collect night soil, “landlords had the rights to their tenants’ solid waste.” Some desperate farmers resorted to stealing human faeces.Our agricultural soils are depleted and reliant on artificial fertiliser, so “biosolids” – as treated human waste has been rebranded – could become ever more valuable.UK water companies recycle more than 1m tonnes of waste into biosolids for agricultural use. But this is strictly controlled by legislation, owing to fears about contamination from heavy metals (via industrial wastewater) and from pharmaceutical products. “Right now, we flush our human waste into a water-based treatment works and it’s very hard to get all of the nutrients out once we’ve mixed it with this huge volume of waste water,” says Abraham Noe-Hays, research director at the Rich Earth Institute in Brattleboro, Vermont. “If we can separate human waste at source, we can reclaim the nutrient value as a resource.”Noe-Hays is mostly interested in repurposing urine. “That’s where most of the fertiliser is.” Urine is particularly rich in phosphorus, a vital component of manufactured fertiliser that is currently mined from phosphate rock, a finite resource, so focusing on liquid waste is a good first step. “Urine is easier to capture and transport, store and treat,” he says. Solid waste needs to be treated over a long period before it can be used.At the moment, says Jordão, composting toilets are “not appropriate for the majority of people”. But they could be one day.David Taylor, a roundwood timber framer for eco builder Ty Pren, has created three composting toilets for clients. They have all been in outhouses, but he can envisage a day when even urban dwellings could be composting human waste.• This article was amended on 9 December 2019 because an earlier version referred to hummus, when humus was meant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27acaf5f19f0b33c70c8e76ec646facc2768f6e3/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35f270344b6de30328df0a6dce4dc8ae","title":"hymen virginity tests us ti","story":"In the US, it is still perfectly legal to doctors to perform ‘hymen checks’ as proof of virginityMichelle Northcote doesn’t remember her paediatrician’s face, but she does remember the ceiling in his office. It was covered with large tiles probably made of foam or cork-board. Each tile was large and rectangular, an off-white color flecked with grey.From the age of six to 13, Northcote spent a long time staring at it. Once a year, for the longest two minutes in history, she would force herself to concentrate on those tiles right after her doctor repeated the familiar phrase:“And now, I have to check your hymen.”Northcote, a New Yorker, recalls the check being “like an awkward fingering”. She never really knew why it happened – her doctor never told her. She never even realized it wasn’t normal until a discussion with university friends years later. The look on their faces said everything when she shared her story – she immediately knew it shouldn’t have happened.At first she assumed her doctor must have been a pervert. And then, after rapper TI disclosed last month that he forces his daughter to have her hymen checked every year to prove that she is a virgin, Northcote had to reconsider those visits and what they meant. “I realized that my mother must have been asking for them, to see if I was a virgin,” says Northcote. She doesn’t know for sure – the relationship between the two is incredibly strained. But as a strictly conservative catholic who was obsessed with virginity, it seems about right.Her mother’s obsession with her virginity started when she was six, and continued until she was a teenager. One night, she dragged Northcote out of bed in the middle of the night to ask if she was having sex. She was so obsessed with her daughter having sex with men that she didn’t even realize that her daughter was in fact a lesbian.Despite years of research dispelling the long-held myth surrounding the hymen – that it breaks after a woman’s first vaginal penetration – its power pertains.Its power remains even after a study from 1906 showed that a sex-worker’s hymen was still intact – which should have been enough to dispel the myth. So too, should have been a 2004 study, which studied 36 pregnant women, 34 of which still had an intact hymen. Still, the myth is so compelling that people would rather believe in virgin pregnancies than facts. The hymen, a fold of membrane at the vaginal opening, varies dramatically from woman to woman. In some women the hymen looks like a ring, in others it is crescent shaped. Some women have several holes, notches or clefts in their hymens, others have no hymen at all.In a TED talk called the virginity fraud, doctors Nina Dølvik Brochmann and Ellen Støkken Dahl describe how the hymen is more like a scrunchie than a hole: “It’s very elastic – for a lot of women, elastic enough to handle vaginal intercourse without sustaining any damage.” For many women, it doesn’t break during sex. Its perforation is no sign of sexual activity, and the accompanying assumption that comes alongside it – that a virginal woman will bleed the first time she has sex – is little more than folklore.And yet, every year, women undergo surgery to “restore” their hymens. Tens of thousands of women also order fake hymen kits every year – thousands of which are in the US. The fake hymen is placed in the vagina before intercourse and spurts blood during the act. One company, HymenShop, told the  it sells the most kits in California and North Carolina.Another Germany-based company, VirginiaCare, told the  it sells thousands of kits across the US every year. Many of their customers, they say, call saying they need the fake hymen to protect themselves. Sometimes the women are virgins but want to make sure they bleed on their wedding night, fearing repercussions. Often, their partners know they plan to use the fake blood, but hitch a plan to deceive parents, who check their bedsheets after their wedding nights.“A lot of girls tell us ‘My husband knows I’m going to use it – but we just need to be sure that there will be blood on the sheets after the wedding night’,” said Daniela Lindeman, a VirginiaCare spokesperson.The company knows that neither blood nor a hymen are indicative of a woman’s virginity, but feel no moral obligation not to produce the product. Lindeman says that it’s not the hymen kit that perpetuates the myth – it’s that fact that people want to believe it.“You will never get this out of their heads. That’s why the myth has been around for 2,000 years, that you need to be a virgin, and that you have to confirm it in this way,” she said.Asked whether they feel a responsibility not to perpetuate lies, Lindeman says that they are providing a service: “We are just trying to help in any way and care about these girls or women. In the end, we are also saving their lives,” she said.•••Dr Jennifer Gunter, a gynecologist and author of The Vagina Bible, says that “the patriarchy is invested in women holding women to biological standards that are impossible.”That very system, she argues, ensures that women who are raped are not heard (hymen checks were, and still are, performed to determine sexual assault and rape) to mark a woman out as a man’s property, and to keep women in fear of enjoying sex.“A woman who has blood stained sheets on her wedding night has sexual trauma. But this culture implies that, as long as a woman is traumatized during her first sexual experience, then that satisfies some sort of ritual,” says Gunter, adding:“It is so offensive. On a human level, and on a biological level.”A systematic review on hymen checks summed up the incredibly harmful impacts of the practice. In one case, an examinee had her arms broken after she “failed” a test. In another case, the test resulted in suicide. Women scream, cry and faint during the tests, and reported self-hatred and loss of self-esteem following them.The fear of it alone can have disastrous consequences.Ashley Lee, 20, from Missouri, was threatened with a hymen check by her parents almost every year before she left home. It was a particular source of terror for her because she had been sexually abused by her brother’s friend when she was young.“I worried I was going to get in trouble for something that wasn’t my fault. I felt like there’d be no one there to help me, like I’d be shamed what happened to me,” she said during a phone interview. “It made me feel like it was my fault.”In an incredible cruel twist to the story, her parents knew about the abuse, and yet continued to hang the test over her head to make sure she never felt comfortable enough to have sex under their roof.“They told me that a doctor would check my vagina and push on parts of my uterus to figure out whether I had sex or not. It terrified me,” says Lee.It was enough to make her leave home aged 16, but the threat had long-lasting impacts. Perhaps contrary to what her parents intended, it made her value her body less, not more: “It made me feel like what’s between my legs is what makes me who I am, that it was my worth,” says Lee.Medicine is a profession as vulnerable to dogma as any – particularly because of the lasting impact that outdated medical texts and a body of research that has historically focused on older white men continues to have. As Gunter puts it: “Some dude writes something in a textbook in the 1920s and its like, goddamnit – it sticks! You have a really hard time undoing it.”For the medical culture to change, something else needs to go first: sexism. “You have to remember doctors are part of society – they are all subject to prejudices and religious beliefs just like normal people are subject to,” Gunter says. To put it bluntly: a medical degree is no guarantee against one doctor’s ignorance.When Gunter was in medical school, the hymen – let alone the social constructs around virginity that surrounded it – was barely spoken about. When it was, it was from a male perspective. Female doctors, surrounded by men and the same “purity principles”, felt uncomfortable setting the record straight: “They’d teach that it hurts the first time women have sex, that you bleed. I’d be thinking – that’s not how I felt – but you couldn’t say that. Until recently, talking about the vagina and sex, it was just not done,” she says.At present, it is not considered medical malpractice to perform a hymen examination – in fact, it’s completely legal. But one New York assemblywoman is hoping to make a tangible difference by changing the law.Michaelle Solages’s bill hopes to take the question completely out of a doctor’s hands. If passed, it will ensure that virginity testing is banned that any medical professional undertaking such a practice will face losing their license and that if the examination is performed in the US, whether inside or outside the medical office, it should be constituted as sexual assault.“This is an aggressive piece of legislation because as a modern society, we can’t stand for this abuse. And that’s what it is, abuse,” says Solages in a phone interview. She argues that the power that a doctor has over their patients, plus the fact that the examination is not fit for purpose, is proof that the procedure is abusive. The bill can’t be heard until at least January, when the house is back in legislative session, but Solages says interest in the bill has been huge. Both Gunter and Solages hope that having more women around the table will mean real change. But in the meantime, there is a glaring double standard: there are no virginity tests for men. While Northcote and Lee were both brought up by parents invested in chastity, their brothers were never held to the same virginity standard.Moreover, rather than encouraging women to be fierce protectors of their own bodies, “virginity testing” put them in harm’s way when it came to later sexual violence.“I just always had this example, that people will take advantage of you if they can.

This is likely to be the last money I inherit, so I want to be careful about what I do with it. We still have a lot to pay on the mortgage, but apart from that we are debt-free. I have several pensions from previous and current jobs but sadly none have much in them.Would it be best to put the money I have inherited on the mortgage or should it go into my current pension (and will this save on tax)? Or should I put it in Isas and hope for the market to improve by the time I retire, which won’t be any time soon?NMThis is earlier than you can get at your cash with a Lifetime Isa where, unless you are buying a home, you can’t access your cash until you are 60. However, because you are 50, saving in a Lifetime Isa isn’t an option. But you can choose to save in a standard cash or stocks and shares Isa, but only up to a maximum of £20,000 in each tax year. There is no tax relief on payments made into an Isa, but income and gains are tax-free and there is no age limit on when you can get at your money (apart from with a Lifetime Isa).There’s no limit on how much of your mortgage you can pay off, but you need to watch out for early repayment charges if you’re on a special deal and want to pay off more than a certain percentage of the loan. The bonus of reducing your mortgage is lower monthly mortgage repayments. If you wanted to get your cash back at a later date, you would have the option of increasing your mortgage back to its original level.Given the limits on what you can save in pensions and Isas – and the possible limit on how much you can pay off a mortgage without paying a fee – putting the whole £35,000 into any one of those things isn’t likely to be an option. Instead, spreading the cash over pension, ISA and mortgage would be a flexible compromise that doesn’t tie up your inheritance completely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daa22653aa4c2813613611c50d0e63c188a8f552/0_0_3227_1936/master/3227.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79cfa7762f75beec1a808b0a574bb253","title":"election 2019 inside momentum podcast","story":"Anushka Asthana reports from inside Momentum, the grassroots movement hoping to propel Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street.

The Conservatives are on course for an overall majority in parliament – but most voters will back parties that want to block an early Brexit. If turnout is similar to last time, the 14 to 15 million who will support the Conservatives or Brexit party will be outnumbered by the 16 to 17 million who will vote Labour, Liberal Democrat, Green, SNP or Plaid Cymru.Tactical voting is not new, but it has a special significance this week. If it happens in enough constituencies, it can ensure that the two-million majority opposed to Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan is reflected in the new House of Commons.The map below shows 50 seats where tactical voting could keep the Conservatives out. Most tactical voting websites draw on one or two sets of polling data, which risk ignoring the specific circumstances of inidual constituencies. The guide draws on a wider range of information – detailed big-sample national polls, but also constituency surveys (including those reported week by week in the Observer), past election results and local activity, such as the recent student registration drives in some key seats (one is Brunel University, in Johnson’s own constituency, Uxbridge).However, without tactical voting, these three seats – like many others – may well return pro-Brexit MPs, despite having clear Remain majorities, because of the way the anti-Conservative vote ides.It should be stressed that there are many other marginals where Labour is the clear challenger to the Conservatives, but in almost all of these seats the Lib Dems are out of the running. There is little need here for a tactical guide to recommend Labour.In general, where the incumbent MP is Labour, they are the best placed to keep out the Tories. There are four exceptions: two in Scotland and one each in England and Wales. Here, without tactical support for the best-placed non-Labour candidate, Conservative gains are a real possibility. However, in two three-way marginals, Labour needs to win over local supporters of the Lib Dems (Portsmouth South) and Plaid Cymru (Ynys Môn) to be sure of defeating the Conservatives.Scotland presents a specific challenge. A number of traditional Labour strongholds went SNP in 2015 and then Conservative in 2017. In these – as well as Gordon, a former Lib Dem seat, and Moray, once an SNP bastion – the SNP are now best placed to see off the Conservatives.Peter Kellner is a polling expert and former president of YouGovSCOTTISH CONSERVATIVE SEATS VULNERABLE TO THE SNP1 Aberdeen SouthA Labour seat until 2015, the SNP now has the best chance of overturning a Conservative majority of almost 5,000 VOTE SNP2 AngusThe SNP needs to squeeze the Labour vote to regain one of its former strongholds VOTE SNP3 Ayr, Carrick and CumnockThree-way contest in 2017, with Labour now in third place VOTE SNP4 Banff and BuchanThe SNP’s Paul Robertson needs to squeeze both Labour and Lib Dem support to overturn a Tory majority of almost 4,000 VOTE SNP5 Dumfries and GallowayOne-time Labour seat won by the SNP in 2015 and the Tories in 2017.

She was then secretary to Springburn community council, and the meeting seemed to confirm their fears. “I asked if there was anything planned and they said: ‘No, there’s nothing planned in the foreseeable future for Springburn. There’s no money,’” she said.“We were literally coloured grey on the map. I couldn’t believe it. They just didn’t expect anyone to ask the question.”Her riposte to that hangs on the wall of the community drop-in centre that Carroll helped found earlier this year in Springburn shopping centre. A laminated aerial photograph of Springburn has been pinned above a table carrying a coffee pot and tea bags.Taken on a bright cloudless day, the image picks out the neighbourhood’s parks, industrial estates and housing schemes. It is clustered with stars and dots in red, green, blue, yellow and gold. The red stickers mark out places the locals want to see improved, green and blue the places they cherish, and yellow marks out homes.Red, green and blue stars are dotted across Springburn Park to the north, built when the area was an industrial powerhouse and home to the Winter Gardens pavilion. Once the largest single- glasshouse in Scotland, the pavilion is now a rusting and derelict skeleton.The widely disliked dual carriageways and flyovers that bisect Springburn and its surrounding Westminster constituency of Glasgow North East are marked out by lines of red dots and stars. And a particularly dense cluster of red stickers covers the shopping centre, which houses the drop-in centre.The drop-in centre’s walls are crowded with job adverts and training course flyers, and an offer from Timpsons, the shoe repair chain, to dryclean suits for free if a jobseeker has an interview. There are rails of free clothes and neatly pressed school uniforms, and locals can borrow DVDs and books, or toys.“It’s a hub it’s a place for folk to come to,” Carroll, now chair of the community council, said. The centre, its utility bills paid by the shopping centre owners, hosts community and police liaison meetings, and surgeries for the local Scottish National party MSP, Bob Doris. Spurred on by Doris, council officers now come to meetings too.Half a dozen women are chatting on sofas grouped together just beyond the aerial map. “It’s the living room, that’s what we call it,” she adds. “We’ll just have chats about whatever is going on. It could be relationships it’s often money.”Brian Casey, a Church of Scotland minister who works closely with Carroll, said the hub was visible evidence of a resurgence in community activism in Springburn. “Until the 60s and 70s, it was such a big industrial area we had shop stewards and people who knew how to run communities,” he said.“That declined during the Thatcher era. It’s now coming back with people in their 30s and 40s, people who want to make this a better place to live, a new generation of activists who can do these things.”Glasgow North East, which had the lowest turnout of any constituency in the UK in 2017, has been a Labour-Scottish National party battleground for a decade. During Alex Salmond’s leadership, the SNP tried to seize it in a byelection after Michael Martin, a Labour MP then speaker of the House of Commons, resigned after a no-confidence motion was tabled against him in 2009.Many locals blamed Martin for a decade of neglect, yet Labour comfortably held the seat. In the SNP landslide election of 2015, Anne McLaughlin finally took the seat for the SNP by 9,222 votes, only to lose it to Labour’s Paul Sweeney by 242 votes in 2017. McLaughlin and Sweeney are competing again at this election.Labour strategists acknowledge holding this seat is a significant test of Jeremy Corbyn’s agenda and his popularity. Setting aside Brexit and independence, Labour and the SNP are fighting on similar territory: both want to scrap universal credit and increase benefits both promise industrial reinvestment and heavy spending on new and upgraded housing.In common with other deprived constituencies across the UK, the intricacies of Brexit have little traction here and nor – for now, at least – does the lure of independence. Carroll and Casey said their concerns are those of day-to-day survival.Much may turn on local issues: Sweeney is campaigning to reopen the Caley, the last of Springburn’s once famous railway works. It finally closed in July, with the loss of 200 jobs, ending 178 years of train-building in the area. By the late 1800s, Springburn’s railway works – Cowlairs, St Rollox, Hyde Park and the Caley – were building and exporting most of the world’s steam locomotives.McLaughlin was at the forefront of a unanimous vote at SNP conference in October calling for drug-control legislation to be devolved from the Home Office to Scotland she wants decriminalisation and safe injection rooms for addicts. There were 1,187 drug deaths in Scotland in 2018, the highest number on record.News about the drop-in centre’s activities has spread. Staff from a local nursery came by with six large shopping bags of nappies, rusks and organic baby food for a new initiative two of the centre’s volunteers launched last month: a food bank for babies.Nine families, some penniless during their transfer to universal credit, others asylum seekers, have been given free food and formula. The neighbourhood’s food banks could not provide them, so they did. Donations have flooded in. A local Salvation Army hall is now storing a small mountain of supplies: infant formula, nappies, antiseptic creams, baby wipes and food.“It’s disgusting in this day and age that people can’t afford baby milk,” said Tracy Pender, the volunteer who initiated it. Her benefits were frozen in 2017, she said, so she understands. “Every one of us knows what it’s like.”There is deep alarm too about so-called “street valium”, an extremely cheap and potent sedative churned out in backroom factories in the city on pill presses dealers can buy on Amazon, with ingredients sourced in China. It has killed scores of people in Springburn.Casey said users buy the pills, frequently laced with adulterants, in bulk at 100 tablets for £30. “It’s cheaper to buy than a bottle of cider,” he said. “Kids don’t need to show any ID to buy street valium.” Many addicts use it to top up their methadone, often with fatal results.“I’m tired of burying people because of drugs and suicide,” Casey added. In one recent seven-week period, he held six funerals for men who had taken their own lives, and estimates a third of the 180 funerals he has led in the last year involved drug-related deaths. “It’s really, really bad.”Natalie McLean, a former addict who lost her father and six other relatives to addiction and helps run a drugs recovery cafe at Casey’s church, points to the shops that thrive on the high street close by.Three chemists run by the chain Rowlands are grouped in a triangle tens of metres across from each other across the street there is another branch in the shopping centre. Every morning they dispense methadone to a regular queue of heroin addicts. There are five bookies and three pawnbrokers.“Poverty and inequality that’s absolutely why they’re there,” she said. “That speaks volumes to me.”The church, a squat single-storey red-brick building built in the 1970s, has become another focus for community activists. It hosts an afterschool club, a “musical memories” club for dementia-sufferers, a Peekaboo preschool play café popular with refugee families, and also distributes vouchers for local food banks.“I now have lots of people who are volunteering, who would never normally come to church apart from baptisms or weddings,” Casey said. He sees his role as a form of community chaplaincy. “There’s a big push to say to people: ‘you have value’. There are families we deal with who are third-generation unemployed.” He wants, he says, “to give them a sense of self-worth”.Carroll has the same optimism. She hopes eventually to see the Winter Gardens reopened it would be a fine symbol of Springburn’s regeneration, she says. A Grade-A listed building, Sweeney is leading a campaign to raise funds to rebuild it. She remembers watching a young cousin sing Flower of Scotland there in the 1970s. She had “a wee nervous voice and as soon as she got two or three verses into it, the whole place erupted and burst into song”, she recalls. “There is a sense of change here. I really do feel it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98252f9d5f036e22162e342c35ef68876b26c9c0/0_190_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90f506ac617c6ff4408d88bd6c9d1e76","title":"ten constituency races to watch on election night","story":"Safe seats turned battlegrounds and key marginals to look out for when the votes start coming inLuciana Berger, for the Liberal Democrats, is hoping to take the north London seat despite her party finishing a distant third in 2017. The odds are still that Tory incumbent Mike Freer will hang on, but Berger is running him close. She is firstly seeking to tempt Tory voters in a largely remain-minded urban seat. Berger, who quit Labour after receiving antisemitic abuse, is also targeting her old party in a strongly Jewish area on its failures about antisemitism and a perceived fudge over Brexit.When Jo Swinson stopped off in the Surrey constituency on her first battlebus trip, some eyebrows were raised: it is held by foreign secretary Dominic Raab with a 23,000-plus majority. But the Lib Dems hope their candidate, Monica Harding, can benefit from mass tactical voting which would see local Labour supporters and other opposed to Brexit – or who simply dislike Raab – club together. The Greens stood down their candidate to help. An outside bet, but could still be 2019’s Michael Portillo moment.Labour since 1950, this seat, held by Gareth Snell, has become a hotly contested marginal. A Tory gain here would be a jewel in the crown for the campaign, signalling a long sought after foothold in the urban Midlands. And this would be despite leave supporter Snell rebelling against his own party to back Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal. Between the 2017 by-election and the 2017 general election, the Labour’s lead on the Tories widened.Canterbury had been represented by the Conservative party for more than a century when Labour’s Rosie Duffield won the seat in 2017, with a majority of just 187. The victory was attributed to the swell in support for Jeremy Corbyn among the city’s growing student population and opposition to Brexit. Last month, the Lib Dem candidate in the seat, Tim Walker, stood down, saying his party risked splitting the remainer vote and handing the seat back to the Tories. Despite calls for them to step back from the race entirely, the party replaced Walker with Claire Malcolmson the following day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39147fe12f56dbc3041de1d2f2bf111384b0b2ae/0_110_4932_2961/master/4932.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0796de8f057e51033727d427e795758c","title":"would a labour government mean an extra a week","story":"Tory research claims party’s opposition to stop and search would lead to a crime surgeA Labour government would mean 52 more murders and 146 more sexual assaults or rapes a year, the equivalent of an additional murder every single week.The Conservative research department, the same body that brought the widely-derided claims that a Labour government would oversee a surge in net migration to 840,000 a year and that Labour’s spending plans would cost £1.2 trillion over five years, has issued findings that it claims show a Labour government would make Britain’s streets less safe.The central claim is that Labour’s supposed opposition to stop-and-search powers for police would see a surge in crime every year, including the specific claim of 52 additional murders.The report also claims there would be 882 more firearms on the streets and 146 sexual assaults or rapes.The “research” was cited by the current home secretary, Priti Patel, in an article written for the Daily .On the specific issue of Labour policy on stop and search, the party’s 2019 manifesto says:Proportionate stop and search based on intelligence is a needed tool of effective policing, but the use of expanded powers means black and Asian men are still more likely to be stopped and searched, poisoning relations between the police and the local communities they serve.It is correct that Jeremy Corbyn, Diane Abbott and others have been critical of the use of stop and search. But the manifesto does not advocate scrapping the tactic.There are Conservatives who share a mistrust of stop-and-search powers, among them the former prime minister, Theresa May. When she was home secretary she introduced reforms to the use of the tactic, telling MPs: “Nobody wins when stop and search is misapplied. It is a waste of police time. It is unfair, especially to young, black men. It is bad for public confidence in the police.”The spurious calculations made by the Conservative research department have been published in a separate document.The department has used official statistics from the Home Office on how many people have been arrested for possession of an offensive weapon or firearm as a result of the use of a stop-and-search power and then, using separate figures from the Office for National Statistics, extrapolated estimates of crimes that the weapons could have been used for.The report itself reveals it is based on the assumption that anyone arrested for the possession of an offensive weapon or firearm would have gone on to commit a crime at some stage had it not been seized by the police. This is an assumption that can not be proven.The College of Policing, the professional standards body that provides research to inform police tactics and approaches, in 2017 concluded that there was only limited evidence that stop-and-search tactics had a meaningful deterrent effect on crime.Last month, Ministry of Justice figures showed that black and Asian people are being subjected to more stop and searches by police while the tactic is being used less on white people. Black and Asian people are being subjected to more stop and searches by police while the tactic is being used less on white people, according to a report.There are other areas the Conservatives could focus on to reduce violent crime, but they are not. The government’s own serious violent crime strategy states that like other types of crime and antisocial behaviour, violent crime has a clear link to “poor life outcomes”. Low educational attainment, poor health including mental health, unemployment, socio-economic factors, weak ties to family and exclusion rates all have links to violent crime.A global study on homicide by the UN office on drugs and crime found that inequality and poverty had a bearing on the murder rate of a country.There is little mention in the Conservative manifesto on addressing these links, whereas Labour proposes to build youth services and invest in a youth justice system in which schools, local authorities, health authorities and youth services ert young people away from the pathways towards crime.Furthermore, the number of murders recorded by the police rose from 434 in the year to March 2015 to 592 in the year to March 2019, 158 more murders.Boris Johnson was challenged by LBC’s Nick Ferrari on Monday over the claims and was unable to explain where the figures had come from – even the prime minister does not appear to be willing to stand by them.To quote, Ferrari: “Unless she’s Mystic Priti, this makes no sense at all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/754abd9d15e6e4d8c913fbf19b58e2b7c6f89c5b/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7dc96671c5969e0625a4c392a4b24b0","title":"candidates in my area who can i vote for uk general election 2019","story":"Enter your postcode to find out all you need to know about which parties are standing in your constituency in the 2019 UK election, and who will represent them.

He said the combination of Tories lies, and hostile media reporting, had had some effect. But Labour had 500,000 members who had been explaining these plans, he said.He also said he and his team had spent two years touring the country explaining what they wanted to do.This is what John McDonnell said about Boris Johnson in the Q\u0026ampA.Isn’t it interesting that as the prime minister tours around different constituencies, he finds it incredibly difficult even to mix with people ... What we’re getting back on the doorstep is he’s probably the least trusted politician that people have ever experienced.Arlene Foster, I think, has come to a judgment this morning which is echoed right the way across the country this is a man whose word you cannot trust.Ask our experts a question As part of a new series, you can ask our political team any questions you have about the general election, and they will post their responses on the politics live blog between 12.30pm and 1.30pm on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.Today, Peter Walker, a political correspondent for the , will answer any questions you have on the general election. You can ask your question via our form here.Q: If you win on Friday, what will be the first thing you do in No 11? And if you don’t win, will you resign immediately or stay in office for a bit?On the second question, McDonnell says Labour is going to win.He says, if Labour wins, he will want to have meetings with the permanent secretary at the Treasury within minutes. He will want to send a letter to the Office for Budget Responsibility, in preparation for a budget eight weeks from Wednesday ie, Wednesday 5 February.I will post a summary shortly.Q: Could you work with the Democratic Unionist party? You have mentioned Arlene Foster warmly twice this morning?McDonnell says if Labour has to govern as a minority government, he will.He has worked with DUP MPs on issues in the past, he says. He says he cannot imagine the DUP voting against a real living wage, or more investment.Q: What would your policies mean for tech giants? And would you want to break them up, as Elizabeth Warren is proposing in the US?McDonnell says he has a group working on this. He has called for a taxation regime – “unitary taxation” – that would lead to them paying more.He says he is not sure whether they need to be broken up, or whether proper regulation would address the problems.But they do need to be more tightly regulated, he says.He says there are questions about their role in society - not just the amount of tax they pay. He says this is a global debate. He is glad it has started.McDonnell says he thinks Labour has inspired other parties. In the US, Democratic candidates are proposing policies they would not have chosen a decade ago, he says.He says he has an agenda whose time has come.Q: Yesterday the Sunday Times said there is a plan for you to take over as interim Labour leader if the party loses. Can you rule that out?McDonnell says he can rule that out because there is going to be a majority Labour government.McDonnell says he thinks the pound will go up in value if Labour win.He says people should look at what has happened to the value of the pound under the Tories.Q: Do you think the election will be decided in Labour heartlands? And why do you think there are people willing to vote Tory who have never done so for decades?McDonnell says the election will be decided everywhere.He says, although Boris Johnson is touring marginals, it is striking that he is not mixing with ordinary people.He says Johnson is “probably the least trusted politician that people have ever experienced”. He says a lot of people will agree with what Arlene Foster said this morning.He also says he thinks people will be surprised by the election result.Q: Is there a price you are not willing to pay for privatised companies?McDonnell says he is not writing a blank cheque. Parliament will decide the price, he says.He says there is strong public support for bringing these firms back into public control. They are natural monopolies, he says. And people are fed up of being “ripped off”.John McDonnell is now taking questions.Q: Are you saying there are four days to save the planet?McDonnell says the country is facing twin emergencies the climate crisis, and a social emergency.He refers to the boy forced to sleep on the floor of a hospital. That is why this election is about saving the NHS, he says.And he says our grandchildren will not forgive us if we do not address the climate crisis.Q: Would you definitely vote remain in a future referendum?McDonnell says he cannot see a better deal than remain, but when Labour does bring its new Brexit deal back, he will make his assessment of it then.McDonnell says Labour’s opponents hate the people of this country.There will always be those at the top who will do anything to stop us – we’ve seen character assassinations, lies and smears taken to a new level …When they attack me, or Jeremy, we know it’s not really about us. It’s about you they hate the people of this country.They think – and I quote the prime minister – that you’re drunk and criminal, they hate the idea you might dream of a better life. They hate the idea you might want real change in how things have been done for so long, and a say in how things are done in future.And here is his peroration.When they come to write the history books, and write about when it all began to turn around.When your children or grandchildren ask you:What did you do to end that world of rough sleeping and food banks?What did you do to save the NHS and stop the Tories selling it off?What did you do to bring back pride to our town?And to finally wrestle back control from those who had kept it to themselves for so long?You can tell them:It all began when we voted Labour, when together we laid the foundations of that new society, foundations so deeply rooted that no Tory could ever tear them up.You can tell them:It was when we proved, once and for all, that the doubters were wrong. That the doubters are always wrong: another world really is possible.McDonnell says it is now clear that Boris Johnson would not be able to get Brexit done quickly.Despite all his promises it is clear to all that far from getting Brexit done, under Johnson Brexit won’t be done for years or we risk a catastrophic no deal.He says he agrees with what Arlene Foster said this morning (see 9.23am) you cannot trust Johnson, he says.McDonnell says Labour will make the nationalised companies publicly accountable.In our first 100 days we will start the process of bringing water and energy into public ownership. We’ll set up boards to run these utilities made up of you, the customer, and you, the worker, as well as representatives from local councils, metro mayors and others.We’ll make sure decisions are taken locally by those who understand the services – those who use them and deliver them.Meetings will be public and streamed online, with new transparency regulations set higher than ever before, so you can see if your road is being dug up, why, and for how long.

With a genre dating back hundreds of years, the choices are overwhelming. So where do you start? With the benefits, that’s where.“Music brings people together and helps kids – and parents – listen better,” says composer John Webb, who has worked with everyone from five-year-old songwriters to traditional Indian musicians and a virtual symphony orchestra to introduce new audiences to classical music. Classical tracks are also scientifically proven to relieve stress, boost brainpower and even help us be more open emotionally – all good news for happy families. So, here’s how to get involved ...Toddlers and preschoolers“Young kids are innately musical,” says Webb, mimicking the singsong speech and extended vowel sounds we instinctively use with small people – “Ooh what a bee-yoo-tiful baby”. Children have an unrepressed desire to dance, too. “Kids move in different ways to different music, tiptoeing, stamping and twirling,” explains Webb.So how can you bring out the best in your mini maestro? Composer Oliver Davis, whose 2018 album Liberty topped the iTunes Classical Charts, says: “Try listening to Carnival of the Animals by Saint-Saëns, which describes lots of wild animals through music.”From age five to eightDid you know that this is the prime age for children to write music? “Kids naturally make up their own songs as they play,” says Webb, who generously describes those improvised 10-second tunes as, “mashups”. To enhance that natural ability, he advises using a story as a hook. “Kids love stories, and quickly understand that different notes and speeds of music create a sense of character. Classical music is easily simplified and it can be creative and powerful for children.”Want to get involved? Try something like the BBC Singers Family Concert (9 February 2020, Milton Court Concert Hall, Barbican, London prices from £5), which promises to be very interactive and is aimed at kids aged five and over. Alternatively, join the BBC Concert Orchestra at Musical Roots (22 February 2020, Queen Elizabeth Hall, Southbank Centre, London prices from £5) for a magical adventure the whole family can enjoy, exploring exciting and unusual connections between composers, their music and their families.From age nine to 12You may know that playing an instrument can improve a child’s memory and coordination, and teach them perseverance. You definitely know that persuading your pre-teen to practise playing an instrument is like lighting a stick of dynamite, so explosive are the arguments.The solution, suggests Davis, could be as simple as inspiring your child by letting them see someone older play their instrument expertly. The BBC is laying on two upcoming events that will transport young people into a different world and get them excited about playing.Try Family Total Immersion: Lift Off! (1 December, Barbican Hall, London prices from £5) with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, which celebrates 50 years since the moon landing with live music, interactive workshops and film to take you on a musical adventure through space. Best of all, there are more than two hours of drop-in foyer activities, including the chance for kids to try a variety of instruments before the show.David Walliams is also doing a special performance with the BBC Symphony Orchestra (2 May 2020, Barbican, London prices from £5), which is virtually guaranteed to hook kids into playing classical music. Walliams will read from his bestselling children’s books, including Bad Dad and The World’s Worst Children, alongside musical treats from a full orchestra.The teenage yearsCan parents introduce anything to their sceptical teen? “The kiss of death is for a parent to show keenness,” warns Webb. “Osmosis is your best bet, so play the pieces you like at home. Go for tracks with a pounding rhythm and bleakness, like Shostakovich Symphony No 5, as the raw energy and emotion may get your teen’s attention.”Film can also be a good entry point for teenagers. “I would always point towards innovative composers and performers who are very current,” says Davis. “So maybe don’t start with Mozart. Instead, go for composers like Max Richter, who scored Mary Queen of Scots, or Joby Talbot, who scored The League of Gentlemen. Both Richter and Talbot are also serious concert hall composers in their own right.” Talbot’s Everest will be performed with the BBC Symphony Orchestra next year (20 June 2020, Barbican Hall, London prices from £10).If all else fails …Stealth is a weapon at your disposal. “There are so many great concerts out there, but the mistake is dragging a reluctant child to a classical concert and expecting them to walk out enlightened and interested,” warns Davis. “So find an appropriate concert of music your child might grow to like and research the music that’s going to be performed. Play sections of it in the car and at home ahead of the concert. Otherwise it’s a huge amount to take in. As the composer Philip Glass once said: ‘People don’t know what they love, they love what they know.’”Learn more about getting the whole family into classical music with advice and events from the BBC’s Get Involved initiative"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc9b7ec1a766940f85932da8b57449ed93c8361e/0_54_3838_2304/master/3838.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c63a2135814e1a4f0edca78a9901a544","title":"world chess champion on the verge of topping fantasy football table","story":"Magnus Carlsen climbs to sixth spot in Fantasy Premier League but puts his success down to ‘luck’Magnus Carlsen, the world’s best chess player for the last decade, is on the brink of reaching the top in another game – fantasy football.The grandmaster is enjoying his best season ever in the Fantasy Premier League (FPL) game and after Sunday’s results he climbed to the sixth position in a table of more than 7 million players worldwide.Carlsen, who is currently competing at the London Chess Classic at Olympia, puts his fantasy football success down to luck. But his FPL team, Kjell Ankedal, has consistently scored high in the overall rankings for the past four years, finishing among the top 3,000 players in the 2017–2018 league.This season, it took Carlsen just six weeks to make it into the top 1,000 and he has been climbing up the table ever since. It will not comfort anyone languishing in the FPL’s lower millions to learn that Carlsen is also an occasional model.Like many Norwegians, Carlsen is obsessed with both the Premier League and its fantasy league spin-off. In 2017, eight players from Norway were in the top 50 FPL players in the world. Norway has an advantage for FPL obsessives because of the relatively free availability of live matches on the country’s TV channels, compared to broadcast restrictions in other countries.Carlsen likes to relax before matches by kicking a ball about and when he is not playing chess he spends hours watching English football, according to chess journalist Tarjei Svensen, who has known Carlsen since he was eight and follows all of his games.“His ability at fantasy league has been known for a couple of seasons now, but this season has been exceptional and he’s had another good week,” Svensen said.He added: “His rise up the charts is incredible. He had a really good year for a while last season and then he dropped a couple of hundred places at the end of the season, but he was still in the top 1,000.”Svensen reckons Carlsen excels at FPL because of a phenomenal memory for Premier League details. “His level of knowledge about English football is amazing, which must help him a lot,” he says.When a Norwegian film crew stumbled upon Carlsen celebrating France’s victory over Romania at Euro 2016, he was singing a West Ham chant praising Dimitri Payet, the French player who was at the club at the time.In general, the cerebral skills of chess are thought to be a big advantage in fantasy football. Svenson says: “It is a similar game, it requires planning and strategy. And he has an incredible memory which helps.”The 29-year-old reigning world chess champion tops an elite FPL made up solely of chess grandmasters and is dominating another where Martin Ødegaard, a Norwegian prodigy who became the youngest player to represent Real Madrid, is languishing near the bottom of the table. “He is really competitive at anything he does. Any competition he enters he really wants to win,” Svensen said.This season Carlsen astutely chose Sheffield United’s John Lundstram from the start, as well as bringing in both Liverpool forwards Mo Salah and Sadio Mané and Tottenham’s Son Heung-min.He’s also benefited from some good fortune – such as the moment Wolves’ Leander Dendoncker came off the bench for Carlsen last week to score his only goal of the season so far.Svenson says: “Clearly there is some luck but when you do consistently so well, it isn’t luck. He says he has a lot of time on his hands because he doesn’t have a regular job. And he is just a huge football fan, he watches everything. I once went to White Hart Lane with him to watch Spurs. But he doesn’t have a favourite English team, he supports Real Madrid.”When he was asked about the success of his FPL team on Norwegian TV in October, Carlsen was worried such questions would jinx his performance. Still, he climbed from 162 in the table to the top three.Carlsen said: “In chess, you know when you’ve done well and when you’ve done poorly, but it’s hard for me to take praise for fantasy league, when I’ve just been lucky.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/203ff4324d70372e2f9ed36931262ad929364e55/7_38_2543_1526/master/2543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb84c2c933d11d1f6f6ca0ee5fa533b1","title":"rugby union talking points weekend action champions cup","story":"It was a difficult weekend for English clubs, with Irish provinces picking up a triple crown of victories over Premiership sidesIreland look like going into the Six Nations Larmour-plated. Joe Schmidt, who stood down as the national side’s head coach after the World Cup, never seemed to trust Jordan Larmour fully, certainly at full-back, but the 22-year old showed in Leinster’s emphatic victory over Northampton at Franklin’s Gardens that he is ready to take over from Rob Kearney, who was among the province’s replacements on Saturday. Larmour was the architect of Leinster’s first two tries, showing how deadly he can be in broken play if given just a trace of time and space, and he was part of a defensive unit that prevented the Saints from turning considerable second-half pressure into points. The victory puts Leinster in charge of Pool One with Northampton’s likeliest route to the quarter-finals being one of the best runners-up. Rivalling them for second place will be Lyon, who broke their Champions Cup duck with a 28-0 victory over Treviso. Paul ReesThe Harlequins head coach, Paul Gustard, insisted his side have not given up hope of qualifying out of Pool Three after their late 25-24 defeat in Belfast on Saturday even if realistically they need to win their three remaining matches. They will at least face the two pacesetting clubs, Ulster and Clermont Auvergne, at home with the former, who lead Clermont by a point in the standings, travelling to the Stoop on Friday night . Bath were dismantled by a quickfire treble of tries in the final 20 minutes at the Rec by Franck Azéma’s side in a 34-17 defeat after a promising first half was wiped out. There is a daunting return leg on Sunday with Bath having lost all three of their pool games so far, while Clermont have lost at home only once in Europe since 2008, in a quarter-final two seasons ago. Claire TolleyExeter’s full-back Stuart Hogg was on the field in Salford for only 17 minutes but the Scottish international, who scored one try and created another in his brief outing, is already making a difference to the table-topping Chiefs. Sale’s Steve Diamond would love to have Hogg’s former Glasgow colleague Leone Nakarawa to bolster the Sharks’ resources but says the Fijian lock has declined a move to England from Racing 92 “because the weather’s too cold … it’s not the money”. He is promising, however, to put out his strongest possible side for the return game at Sandy Park, taking sardonic aim at sides who put out weakened teams in the Champions Cup. “I might just send the kids down. Other teams are doing that, aren’t they? I could send my under-19s down. We work hard to get into the competition and you have to respect it.” Many would have expected La Rochelle to be posing a more serious threat in Pool Two but they have so far lost all three matches, including two at home. The latest disappointment came courtesy of a 27-24 loss to Glasgow who were hastened to victory by another fine finish from the flying Kyle Steyn, South African-born but Scottish qualified, who has just signed a new contract to stay at Scotstoun until 2022. Robert KitsonSaracens remain just about in the mix in Europe, albeit tenuously. It is clear they are not prioritising their defence of the Champions Cup title they have bigger matters on their minds at home. Nevertheless, the integrity of the competition is compromised as a result and there are rules against fielding under-strength teams. Very difficult to prove, though, against the perfectly legitimate concern of squad management. Besides, Saracens probably feel tribunals can hurt them only so much after their recent experiences. Either way, the English challenge in Europe is looking as anaemic as ever, bar Exeter. This time not even Saracens can be relied on. Their team sheet this weekend for the return against Munster in Barnet will be interesting. A win with a bonus point might draw them level with Munster but Racing will almost certainly register the same at home to the Ospreys, putting them in comfortable control of Pool Four.

So how about duck-billed platypuses? You’ll know the answer if you’ve raced through the sequels to Kes Gray and Jim Field’s giddy picture book Oi Frog! – which seems to be just about everyone at the Lyric theatre for this boisterous musical adaptation, where the characters and rhymes from the popular series are shaken up and scattered across an original new tale. Like pop stars holding the mic out to their fans, this gang of actors can count on kids to finish every line. “What about sofas?” they ask. “Gophers!” bellows six-year-old Hilda into my ear.Hilda loves the Oi series: at bedtime, one book always leads to another, albeit with diminishing returns. There’s barely a plot between the stories, so neither of us can imagine how they’ll inspire an hour-long show. The setting in Emma Earle’s production – co-written with Zoe Squire, Luke Bateman and Richy Hughes – is Sittingbottom school for animals, inspired by a blackboard scene in Oi Frog! where cranky Cat teaches rhymes that tell creatures where to sit. Preschoolers and reception pupils will respond to a plot that touches on overcoming nerves, making friends and braving school dinners, before growing increasingly zany.That sourpuss becomes Sittingbottom’s head prefect and Frog is a jumpy new student whose sentimental ballad might be the mushiest amphibian solo since Robin sang Halfway Down the Stairs on The Muppets. However, once he learns that frogs sit on logs – splinters and all – our hoppy hero rebels and becomes a demon rhymer, laying down new rules, with cats forced to sit on gnats.The pace mostly matches the delirium of the books: one show-stopping number in the canteen finds Cheetah serving fajitas while dancing to salsa and bouncing giant beach balls at the audience. For Hilda, this is the highlight – along with a rampaging elephant who brandishes his deadly trunk and sprays us all with water. The accompanying Scarface gag (“Say hello to my little friend”) is one of very few jokes winked at adults. Elsewhere, a “take back control” line falls flat. While the school setting springs naturally from the picture books, there is an ill-fitting subplot about Cat’s nine lives as a superhero. It will also be dispiriting to some grownups, relishing screen-free time with the kids, to find that so much of the play’s new material revolves around television.Field’s illustrations have been faithfully rendered as a striking assortment of puppets by Yvonne Stone. As Cat, Lucy Tuck wears a huge feline mask above her head which, in the manner of The Lion King, works in tandem with her own seething expressions. Frog is a cheery hand-and-rod puppet with eyebrows that seem to soar above his eyes, just as in Field’s illustrations. There’s a variety of styles in the music, too, from the gnu’s folksy down-river ditty to a Hamilton-esque rap battle between Frog and Cat. While I found the songs largely forgettable, Hilda was still singing the opening number hours later.Like the books, it all adds up to an exuberant experience that leaves you rhyming endlessly. So audiences may well tell their best friend to sit in the West End."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d2b7ac379d13ff9b8872e5b3592501567878bae/716_680_3583_2151/master/3583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db5d248a443ed06ad10aad0d918ce351","title":"airpods pro review a touch of apple magic","story":"Good sound, solid battery life and effective noise cancelling wrapped up in a tiny, potent packageApple’s true wireless earbuds have gone “pro” and in doing so deliver on the promise of the 2017 originals. The new AirPods Pro are worth the wait.Apple managed two pieces of magic in 2017 with the original £159 AirPods. They just worked without the skips, blips or audio delay, and came in a tiny battery case that kept them charged and safe – a combination that competitors still find hard to match.But they had one big problem: no isolation from the outside world. It meant that in any noisy environment you struggled to hear your music.Three years later, the £249 AirPods Pro and their silicone earbud tips fix that fundamental problem, adding active noise cancelling for good measure.The look, feel and operation of the AirPods Pro will be familiar to anyone who has seen or used the original AirPods. Small white earbuds replete with stalks and a small flip-top white case into which they snap to store and charge.The stalks are a little smaller and have a squeezable control surface on them. But the biggest difference is the little silicone earbud tip that helps to block out noise.In true Apple fashion the ear tips aren’t standard – replacements cost $4 per pair in the US but the UK cost is currently unknown. You get three sizes in the box and they are easy enough to swap between but hard to pull off by accident. There’s also a fit test on the iPhone that detects if you’ve got the correct size earbud with a good seal.At 5.4g per earbud the AirPods Pro are 1.4g heavier than the AirPods but still light and well balanced. Once inserted the AirPods Pro are some of the most comfortable and secure-fitting true wireless earbuds available rivalling Samsung’s Galaxy Buds and Libratone Track Air+ on that front. Put them in and as long as you don’t brush the stalks you’ll forget there there.The charging case is a smidgen bigger and heavier than that of the AirPods, but that still makes it one of the smallest and best available. It fits in the money pocket of your jeans, holds the AirPods Pro tightly and the lid closes with a satisfying snap.The case charges via Qi wireless charging or Apple’s proprietary Lightning cable. The AirPods Pro offer more than four hours of continuous listening with noise cancelling active and charge in the case about five times, with a total play time of more than 24 hours.While good, rivals such as the Track Air+ last for about six hours between charges with noise cancelling on. Four hours is certainly good enough for general wearing and commuting but not for long-haul flights.Pairing is just as easy as previous versions of the AirPods. With an iPhone or iPad all you have to do is open them near the device and follow the instructions. The pairing information is then synced between all your Apple devices using iCloud, so you can seamlessly switch between an iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, Mac or even Apple TV.They work well with non-Apple devices too, supporting the Bluetooth 5.0 standard or earlier revisions. With the earbuds in the open case, press the button on the back to pair them with anything else such as a Windows PC or Android device. But you need an Apple device to change settings and update the earbuds.The AirPods Pro have the same H1 chip as the AirPods 2 and Beats PowerBeats Pro, and as such have similar bullet-proof, lag-free connectivity and the ability to share audio with other H1-supporting devices meaning two people can listen to one iPhone, iPad or Apple TV.New for the AirPods Pro is a pressure-detecting surface on the stalks. Squeeze the pad, rather than tap or swipe, once for pause, twice for skip forward or thrice to skip back. What felt odd to start with coming from the swipes and taps of other earbuds quickly became second nature.Squeeze and hold to either activate Siri or switch between noise control modes. By default that’s straight from active noise cancelling to ambient listening mode, which lets in sound so you can hear announcements, but you can also turn both systems off too if you’d prefer.Take one out and the music pauses (if used with an Apple device), put it back in to start again. The only thing missing is volume control, which is a shame. Apple’s voice assistant can also listen out for its “Hey Siri” wake-word via an iPhone and Siri can read out texts and iMessages, but not WhatsApps or other notifications for now.Settings and the fit test can be reached in the Bluetooth settings on an Apple device. But you can also switch between noise control modes in Control Centre on an iPhone or iPad by long pressing on the volume control.The AirPods Pro are a step up in audio quality for Apple’s own-brand headphones, which isn’t a surprise as a good seal in the ear works wonders for full reproduction of sound. The earbuds produce tightly controlled, well-balanced highs and mids, with enough punch in the low end to produce a nice, rounded sound at pretty much any volume.They make a good go of most music genres, but those looking for real thumping basslines or who enjoy the raw energy of a thrashing guitar will have to look elsewhere. There’s no equaliser either.As such AirPods Pro sound good – but you’re not going to be discovering new nuances in your most-loved tracks in quite the same way you might with the very best-sounding headphones such as Sony’s WF-1000XM3 or Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless.The active noise cancelling on the AirPods Pro is surprisingly effective at reducing most background noise. It handled the majority of the day-to-day commute noise very well, and even stood up to engine drone on a long-haul flight. They weren’t quite as noise deadening as the excellent Sony WF-1000XM3 earbuds or full-size Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 letting a little more chatter through, but they also weren’t miles off, which is remarkable given how tiny the AirPods Pro are in comparison.They also handle wind noise very well, which is something Sony’s earbuds and many noise-cancelling over-ear headphones struggle with. Even when it’s blowing a gale you can still clearly hear your music.Call quality was excellent, minimising background noise and coming across clearly to the other end of the call. But the AirPods Pro lack any sidetone, which is the ability to hear yourself in the call, making it hard to know whether you’re shouting.As well as the AirPods Pro work, they suffer from the same issue as any true wireless earbuds available at the moment. The case and each earbud has a non-replaceable battery that will eventually wear out. Repair gurus iFixit recently gave the AirPods Pro a repairability score of zero. Apple only offers full replacements, not repairs, which makes the AirPods Pro disposable.The same could be said of many wireless headphones, but also for most earphones that do not have replaceable cables, which frequently break and then are simply thrown away. All of which has an environmental cost worth considering.The AirPods Pro are a triumph for Apple. They’re small, comfortable, last long enough for most listening sessions, slot into an unrivalled truly-pocketable case and – finally – offer not only proper noise isolation thanks to silicone tips, but also surprisingly effective active noise cancellation.They have the same magic that makes the standard AirPods effortless to use, particularly with Apple’s devices. They simply work, even with Android or Windows machines.Sure, they’re expensive, and they don’t quite reach the exquisite audio highs of Sony’s WF-1000XM3 while letting a little more chatter through the noise cancelling. But they’re tiny by comparison, more comfortable to wear and have a case you can fit in the money pocket of your jeans - a convenience that simply can’t be underestimated.The biggest issue you might face with the AirPods Pro is actually getting hold of a set, as of the time of writing they’re sold out until January.Pros: secure fit, comfortable, rock-solid connectivity, good sound, great noise cancelling, sweat resistant, seamless connection between multiple Apple devices, works with Android and Windows, excellent case, wireless charging, good call qualityCons: expensive, no on-earbud volume control, no settings on AndroidWindows, not repairable, stalks, only available in white This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

For example, Melaten-Friedhof is among the most beautiful cemeteries in Europe, set in a huge park with wonderful trees and plants that attract lots of birds. It is 20 minutes’ walk east of Brüsseler Platz, in the Lindenthal district, and was modelled on Paris’s Père Lachaise cemetery. It has some beautiful tombs from the early 19th century to the present day – especially on Millionaire Avenue, where the city’s wealthiest inhabitants were buried.There are 12 Romanesque churches in Cologne. Wherever you walk in the centre you’ll come across at least one. For me the most fascinating is the Basilica of St Ursula, close to the main train station. Make sure to see the Goldene Kammer (Golden Chamber), where the walls are decorated with an enormous mosaic made of thousands of human bones and skulls. According to one legend, these are the bones of 11,000 virgins killed because they refused to marry the Huns. It’s an impressive place, both cruel and beautiful. Also worth visiting is St Peter’s, close to main shopping street (Schildergasse), which has a huge painting by Peter Paul Rubens, and an altar by 20th-century sculptor Eduardo Chillida.The district I’ve lived and worked in for 30 years, Belgisches Viertel (the Belgian Quarter), has evolved over the decades from calm and residential to hip neighbourhood with little coffee bars, restaurants and creative stores. The heart of the quarter is Brüsseler Platz, where Kölsch, a typical Cologne beer served in 200ml glasses (about a third of a pint), flows abundantly, especially on summer evenings. Right on the square is Hallmackenreuther, a 1970s-style coffee bar serving breakfast and snacks during the day that turns into a trendy bar in the evening. Popular with artists and musicians, it has retro furniture, huge windows overlooking the square and a striking six-metre neon ballerina on one wall.On a rainy day I like to go to art nouveau Neptunbad, a public bath built in 1912 that now offers indoor and outdoor saunas, pools, relaxation areas and a Japanese garden. There’s also a restaurant serving light and healthy dishes. The building is strikingly beautiful, and large parts of the original decor remain, giving the changing rooms a special flair. The historic sauna is wonderful, as is the Emperor’s Bath (Kaiserbad), in which you can drift along to underwater music. The rest is very modern, with an Asian aesthetic.• Admission from €19.50 for two hours, Neptunplatz 1, neptunbad.de If you love fashion from the 1970s, 80s and 90s, head for the vintage shop Todd. Close to Brüsseler Platz, it serves the city’s various subcultures well and has an unpretentious and friendly atmosphere. In addition to secondhand clothing, you can also find backpacks, trinkets and books, and small collections from local designers who print T-shirts, upcycle clothes from old shirts, and produce leather accessories from scraps.• Brüsseler Strasse 72, todd-the-shopA wonderful bookstore, and an institution in Cologne when it comes to art books, is the three-floor Buchhandlung Walther König. I can stay in there for hours looking at all the tomes on architecture, film, design, fashion and art. It’s not only of interest for art lovers, but a paradise for lovers of beautifully made books on all subjects. The founder, Walther König, and his son, Franz, are often in the shop and very approachable, and the ever-changing decorated store-window is regularly curated by artists.• Ehrenstraße 4, buchhandlung-walther-koenig.deCologne has had a lively gallery scene since the 1960s. One I recommend is Galerie Gisela Capitain, just around the corner from Buchhandlung König, who holds for example the estate of Martin Kippenberger in her spacious rooms, and Galerie Buchholz hidden behind an antiquarian bookstore, where spacious rooms exhibit internationally established artists such as Isa Genzken and Anne Imhof. Younger galleries such as Ginerva Gambino or Raum Drei promote emerging talent. Most of these spaces are in the centre of Cologne. My favourite newer gallery is Jan Kaps, which represents a younger generation of international artists in a variety of media, from painting and conceptual art to photography, video and sculpture, as well as hosting lectures. Kaps also has two smaller galleries on the same street (Jülicherstrasse).The Museum of East Asian Arts (Museum fuer Ostasiatische Kunst), on the edge of the Aachener Weiher lake, is about 15 minutes’ walk from Melaten cemetery, but still within the green belt. It’s one of the smaller museums, and rather quiet, which is why it’s so special. The 1970s red-brick building was built by Japanese architect Kunio Maekawa, a student of Le Corbusier. The collection is comprehensive, with furniture, woodcuts, utensils, lacquer work, painting, sculpture and much more from China, Korea and Japan, some pieces from early as the 15th century. At the centre of the complex is the beautiful Japanese meditation garden, which fits perfectly with the serenity of the museum. After visiting the collection, stop in the museum cafe, Schmitz, which is run by one of the top restaurateurs in Cologne. From the terrace, you can enjoy the best ice-cream in Cologne with views of the lake.• Permanent collection €6€3.50, closed Mondays, Universitätsstraße 100, museum-fuer-ostasiatische-kunst.deAround 45 minutes’ drive, or train journey (to Satzvey station), south of the city, in the middle of a field in Mechernich, is the Bruder-Klaus-Feldkapelle, a small chapel designed (between 2005 and 2007) by the great Swiss architect Peter Zumthor, who also designed the famous Kolumba diocesan museum incentral Cologne. The interior is made of over 100 spruce trunks in a wigwam shape, covered in concrete and then set on fire to leave a sombre interior of charred wooden remains. The top of the chapel has been left open so that sunshine and rain alike fall into the otherwise dark space. It’s a very peaceful place.• Open 10am-5pm in summer and 10am-4pm in winter, closed Mondays except on religious holidays, feldkapelle.deClose to Barbarossaplatz is the cosy nom bar, which has been open for 50 years now and immediately transports you to another time. Rather than pretending to be hip and cool, it feels authentic and unique, with shelves full of old jazz vinyl that are played on the venue’s record player. The furniture is also old, as are the yellowed photos of jazz legends on the walls, though you don’t have to be a jazz aficionado to love this wonderful and atmospheric pub.• Weyerstrasse 59, on FacebookWhen to goCologne has loads of events all year round, but there are a few special times – not least the rambunctious carnival, which includes several days of costume parades, songs and beer (20-28 February). Art Cologne, involving 180 galleries (23-26 April 2020), is one of the world’s oldest fairs for modern and contemporary art, and Sommer Köln features concerts, theatre and more in July and August.Where to staySmarty hotel (doubles from €98 room-only) has cool pods and dorms.

It’s not a reference to the quality of drinking water (about which polemic abounds because it is so dirty) but to the beguiling lure of this dusty and dangerous yet strong and charismatic city. It’s a dictum that might be applied to the whole 2,000-mile Mexico-US borderland of which Juárez and its sister city on the US side, El Paso, form the fulcrum.Ten years ago, I returned from several months’ immersion along that frontier, reporting on a narco-cartel war for this newspaper and eventually writing a book, Amexica, about the terrain astride the border, land that has a single identity – that belongs to both countries and yet to neither. A frontier at once porous and harsh: across which communities live and a million people traverse every day, legally, as do hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of goods annually.In the past 10 years I’ve returned scores of times and even lived there for a while, but now the border crisis is so urgent – with regard to narco-traffic and migration – that I felt I needed to go back and revisit voices and themes, try to measure what has changed and what has not since I wrote the book. Amexica + 10, if you like. This is now a frontier on which US president Donald Trump fixates, pledging a wall to run its length as a rampart against an “invasion”. Thousands die or disappear trying to cross it, desperate migrants gather on its southern side, with dreams and illusions of America, only to be incarcerated, separated from family and deported when they get there.What were lonely desert byways 10 years ago now host traffic jams of reporters and TV crews, as the border becomes a place of humanitarian disaster, main mast of Trump’s re-election campaign. Back then, you had to explain who and what Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán and his Sinaloa cartel were. Since that time, we’ve had TV series Narcos ad nauseam, the films Sicario 1 and 2, some wonderful journalism and El Chapo’s trial-as-theatre in New York.Ten years ago, the story along the borderline was narco-traffic, to which the theme of migration played an accompanying role, as the cartels moved in on human trafficking. Now the world is on the move, and much of it has converged on “Amexica”. While 10 years ago, most migrants at the border were in flight from violence and poverty in Mexico, now thousands flee gangland violence in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras in Ciudad Juárez, a “little Havana” of waiting Cubans is established they come from eastern Europe and Asia Haitians arrive in Tijuana migrants gather in Ciudad Acuña from the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa.A decade ago, the administration of Barack Obama began a clampdown on criminal immigrants, and accelerated deportations to record levels. Now, Trump has shocked his own country, collided with federal courts and outraged the world with policies separating children from parents, appalling conditions of incarceration, wholesale roundups of immigrants without papers – or criminal records – and the sending back ofasylum seekers to “remain in Mexico” (rather than wait for their initial hearings in the country where asylum has been claimed as per international law).But drug violence, cartels and their conviviality with government are perennial and ubiquitous. Amexica was published after the government of Felipe Calderón declared war on the cartels in late 2006, after which murder rates hit the highest since the Mexican revolution, and Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world. Homicides then waned, only to spike again now: last year was the bloodiest yet in Mexico, and 2019 is set to overtake it, with the government last week counting 29,574 reported homicides to the end of October.Ten years ago, the task was to report how Guzmán’s Sinaloa cartel supplanted rivals along the border west of Juárez, for export mainly of cocaine then downriver, less successfully, confronting the Zetas and Gulf cartels in Coahuila and Tamaulipas. Now, with Guzmán jailed and his cartel fragmented, the plaza – the drug traffic turf – is unquiet again, as the Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación stakes its claim, trafficking mainly in synthetic drugs and fentanyl to fill a vacuum left by the clawback on prescribed opioids in the US. Violence increases when the plates shift, and while it used to be worst along the border, now – though Tijuana is Mexico’s, and the world’s, murder capital – killing is across the country, through Jalisco, Colima, Guerrero and Veracruz in particular.What happens along this frontier is a prism through which to examine a world where the illicit economy bleeds into the supposedly legal one, to render the border between them a sieve like the physical border itself, as high street banks launder profits of drug traffic with impunity. Amexica ended with the story of the Wachovia bank moving $378bn from Mexico, much of it from the Sinaloa cartel, without adequate checks. HSBC, too, was caught moving El Chapo’s money. No one from either bank has been arrested, let alone jailed. Following Guzmán’s conviction, US government forfeiture of his alleged $14bn value is all “back in Mexico” – money sent to be laundered south of the border – the small change none of the hundreds of billions sent into the “legal” economy by Wachovia or HSBC are in their sights. I call it the lie of legality.And so, in what is supposed to be peacetime, a new kind of 21st-century war rages across this enthralling country. The official number of homicides in Mexico since 2007 – 307,624, excluding the disappeared, until October this year – stands at a level akin to that in some of the worst wars in recent history, yet effervescent Juárez is not like, say, besieged Sarajevo. Part of my book’s aim was to describe unspeakable violence in places where life goes on and daily encounters were generally a delight. This does not change: in no place I know are the ready smile, the unnecessary chat, the twinkle-in-the-eye so pervasive. Uber works fine, people go to mass and to market, shopping centres open, burritos and pastries are delicious, restaurants full again. “It looks normal,” says Julián Cardona, who took the photographs in Juárez for this article, “but it’s not.”Cardona has coined the term “urban Frankenstein” to describe his adoptive city. Last January, the bodies of a family running a grocery in Juárez were discovered only after stray dogs found and started eating them. In Tijuana, I reported on the abduction and murder of two Honduran migrant boys – Jasson Ricardo Acuña and Jorge Alexander Ruíz – and the testimony of a third, who survived and led police to the scene. José Alberto Álavarez, Tijuana’s district attorney, showed me photographs of the victims, aged 16 and 17: “I fear to note that one of the deceased was dressed in women’s clothes,” he says, showing a lifeless body, bloodied and strangled, wearing a brassiere and red skirt. “Not only that, but when the survivor took us to the house, one of the killers was still wearing the clothes and shoes of the deceased. Two days later. That’s what we’re dealing with.”First stirrings precede first light in the Chihuahua desert, beyond the frayed edges of Juárez. Mumbling, moaning, crashing of pans heating coffee and the odd scream, at Visión En Acción rehabilitation centre, or “rescue asylum”. As the sun’s fiery rays break over the scrub, residents emerge from their sleeping quarters around a courtyard, deranged but dutifully carrying soiled blankets to be bleached in the heat. Rafael heaves his pungent load, saying first that he was a missionary from Veracruz, but then again, he was a dealer from Juárez actually, he’s a millionaire from Zacatecas – he’s not sure.This sanctuary for the abandoned mentally ill and other vulnerable people has been run for 24 years by pastor José Antonio Galván, who joked 10 years ago that the city out there – full of yonkes, junkyards of cars totalled in America, refitted for the road – was actually a “human junkyard”, while this was “a haven of peace”. Which it is, in a way: where recovering addicts, penitent cartel sicarios (hitmen) and their mistresses, psychos, street dealers and those discarded by the city’s assembly plant economy are refitted for life. Last time I was here, I spent a few nights sharing quarters with a man called Josué, who told me he had been “dead when I got here”, from street-gang life in Los Angeles and heroin in Juárez. Today, all that remains of him here is his degree certificate, framed on the pastor’s wall – Josué is now a practising nurse.Galván still looks like the teddy boy he once was – in a purple paisley jacket that seems, and doesn’t seem, out of place here – and greets me with the poised fists of the boxer he also was. “The Lord is on my side,” he says, punching the air. I feel 10 years older, I tell him, yet he seems younger. “Have passion, have faith, have life,” he laughs. “These are my people, under my wing. I feel part of this desert now, like a lizard – you’ve got to look carefully, know what you’re doing and move fast.” Threats from cartels and gangs seeking out patients to enact vengeance have eased, he reports, but “they never go away”.An estimated 40,000 people have disappeared since 2006 in Mexico – one of the most outrageous aspects of this war – and some are found by Peludo, the centre’s pet dog. “He keeps finding legs, then a head, different bodies in different places, of people who have been kidnapped and disappeared in the desert,” says Galván. “Sometimes when it rains, bodies surface, and come floating.”In the yard, “his people” greet Galván, hugging his waist while he pats their matted hair, strokes their scars, each precious to him. Things change, and they don’t. Becky, former pole dancer and crackhead, is dead now, as is big Oscar, former sicario for the Barrio Azteca gang, street affiliate of the old Juárez cartel. But Yogi is still here, shaven-headed 10 years ago, now sporting a jester’s hat. He has Down’s syndrome and schizophrenia.There’s been impressive building work in recent years what were timeworn breeze-blocks are now whitewashed walls there’s air conditioning, even a TV area for telenovelas and baseball. Across the patio, the mazed eyes, mind-sickness, and poignant affection between Galván and what he calls “my family”, echo down 10 years on different faces. The drugs, too, are different, says Galván – “We’re seeing less crack, more crystal meth, and synthetics” – but their ravages are the same. The shelter’s nurse, Imelda Castro, explains that it takes “a balance between miracles and medication”.The place is staffed, as it always has been, by former patients, and Galván feels that the story of his last decade can best be told through their example they are disarmingly open about where they’ve come from.When Vera, the accountant at the centre, arrived four years ago, she was “completely wild”, says Galván. Born to a middle-class family in Guanajuato, Vera had “entered a life of prostitution and pole dancing – pregnant at 15,” she says. “I attracted bad people: narcos, sicarios, jefes…” Before long, she was one of them, selling and moving drugs for the Knights Templar cartel.“I saw everything: murder, kidnappings. So much violence, so many drugs, so much sex, you don’t see it for what it is. I admired the power of these people, and respected their authority.” But such proximity was also dangerous, as the Knights were overrun by the Jalisco Nueva Generación: “They kill women because they have so much information the favoured women know everything.”After a disastrous relationship, Vera attempted suicide, but was rescued by her parents and placed in a psychiatric hospital. Her parents sold their house to pay for treatment at a shelter and finally Vera arrived at Visión En Acción.That must have been difficult in the case of Neor (not his real name), host for my overnight stay. He had had a “bad life” with his father “taking drugs, whipping us all – no money, no food”. Neor started on crystal, crack and solvents at the age of 12, then started “robbing and killing for money”, and inevitably did so for a major cartel. “I was a sicario,” he says.“Once you’ve killed the first time, it gets easy – I was taking so much crystal, I could handle it.”Then one day the time came for him to kill a man who had been given the task of selling a large amount of meth, but had kept and spent the money. “It was a big hit. For some reason I didn’t want to do it, but they said if I didn’t, they’d kill me.” After a shootout at his house – “I took a bullet in the leg”, Neor shows me the scar – he escaped and went on the run. He had heard about a former drug dealer now working at Visión En Acción, and was brought here. How long ago? He beams: “Four months ago.”“I’m strict,” says Galván, “afraid of nothing.” One recent morning, though, Neor found himself out on the highway, planning to return to Guanajuato. “I started shaking,” he says, “and a voice in me said: ‘Don’t. Go back to work’.” “There’s a devil waiting to lure them back any time,” says Galván, “and I gotta beat that devil up.” I had for a moment forgotten that the pastor himself was once an addict on the street. “I learned that,” he says, “when I was living among the trash cans – when I was one of them.”On a rainy September morning in Tijuana, at the border’s western edge, an ostentatious but imposing ceremony was arranged: an incineración de droga by combined law enforcement agencies, where they set fire to 26,000 kilos of heroin, cocaine, crystal meth and other drugs. A torch is applied, flame spreads across the hillock of drugs, black smoke billows skywards – and a platoon of agents from the Agencia de Investigación Criminal line up for a team photo against the backdrop of the inferno. It’s been a while since this was done publicly here, but everyone knows it won’t be the last time, and that – gallant though the choreography is – this pyre represents but a grain among millions, on the move, out there.My journey through Amexica 10 years ago began and ended here when Tijuana was second only to Juárez in its murder rate. Last year, a report by the Citizens’ Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice, which measures homicides per capita, found six of the world’s 10 most murderous cities to be in Mexico, and Tijuana top of the list.The epilogue to my book was an interview with Antonio Irán “Hiram” Muñoz, whose macabre expertise at the prosecutor’s office was to analyse the mutilations of cartel victims to decode any messages they might contain – he called it “necropsia” rather than “autopsia”: severed feet or toes if someone walked from a cartel, the sliced tongue of a snitch. A forensic expert, but also a philosopher, Muñoz was furious at how few prosecutions resulted from his work.We meet now at the Ateneo de Ciencias Universitarias y Artes. Muñoz himself founded this college “to train young people to blend the ‘criminalistic’ – what is found at a crime scene, scientifically – and the ‘criminological’, which is psychological, why the criminal did what he did”, he says. “Ten years ago, we talked about terrible things happening in this city. But I was failing to change things at the prosecutor’s office, so decided to create my own university and impart what I knew to the next generation.This change has come about because Mexico’s domestic drug market – the so-called narcomenudeo – has increased further since Amexica and is now believed to account for even more violence than that caused by competition for “export” plazas. “The drugs don’t just fly to the north,” says Muñoz, “they also stay here, so that now there’s a war for the streets here – and this contributes to the general collapse. There is no message to send now: I just erase you from the point of sale. Kill one, and I have four more waiting to replace you.”Muñoz notes the arrival of fentanyl on the domestic and export markets: “It’s cheap to make and easy to smuggle. I also come across it in my forensic investigations – more deaths from fentanyl, often mixed with cocaine, without the addict knowing. Dealers cut other drugs with fentanyl to make them even more addictive.“Human beings are addicts, addicts of pleasure and power – coffee, alcohol, sex, extreme sports – and drugs are the most addictive of all. It’s never going to go away, and what makes this war pure stupidity is that we are never going to win it unless we see the addict as a sick person, not a criminal.”The road bends, along stretches of new fence, to the river’s end, where the twin towns of Brownsville and Matamoros, one of six bi-national metropolitan border areas, face one another. A decade ago, Michael Seifert had recently left the priesthood at his parish of San Felipe de Jesús in Cameron Park, Brownsville, fallen in love with a paediatrician and married her. But he continued to work for the community in a post-pastoral role, until this poorest, entirely Hiic, quarter of town became the last to be “incorporated”, with running water and electricity in almost every home. Still devout, but a radical theologian, Seifert posited 10 years ago that the Virgin of Guadalupe portrays a dancing Madonna, pregnant with the mestizo Mexican race – mixed because it was the product of rape by Spanish conquistadors. We meet again: “I had Mexican seminarians walk out on me for that,” he says with a smile. “She’s supposed to be immaculate.”Seifert remains “plugged in to Cameron Park, all the better to keep people connected”, but has adapted his work to the migration crisis, for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), with an “integrated advocacy” team guiding migrants as they cross from Matamoros into Brownsville in the US, and writing regular internet reports entitled Views from Alongside a Border.“These people came here,” he says, “because they wanted to be safe. Yet over in Matamoros, they are prey to deadly criminals, and here they are met with a system carefully designed to fail them. They can have no idea of the evil genius of our immigration and asylum apparatus, satanic in its cleverness in keeping them out, and in danger.”In January 2019, despite an outcry over child separation, the Trump administration introduced “Migrant Protection Protocols”, whereby asylum seekers, rather than wait for their “credible fear” interview in the US (as per the 1939 Montevideo treaty on political asylum), are sent back to wait in Mexico. The Mexican government of leftwing president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has given full support, earning compliments from Trump for “spectacular” results: some 58,000 asylum seekers are now reported returned to, and waiting in, Mexico.Immigration courts on the US side are perfunctory and dysfunctional. I was forbidden entry to the huge tent – or “soft-sided facility” as the government calls it – erected on the Brownsville side of the river to hear pleas by video link. But I did visit two courts dealing with detained migrants at nearby McAllen and Port Isabel: rows of shackled, confused, weary people hustled through production-line “justice”, with, in some cases, no more exchange with the bench than a nod to indicate understanding of their “rights”, before deportation.Beside the Gateway bridge connecting Matamoros to downtown Brownsville, across a few yards of river and reed bank, is a tent city of around 1,000 people, encamped for safety in numbers, mostly “waiting in Mexico” for the date on their crumpled but clasped Notice to Appear given to them before they were sent back under Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy. A higher proportion are returned to Matamoros than anywhere else on the border, for all the dangers.My book Amexica ended with the story of the massacre of 72 migrants at San Fernando, Tamaulipas, in 2010. Migrant massacres and disappearances have become increasingly common. On Christmas Eve 2011, 15 migrants were dragged from a diocesan shelter in Matamoros, and never seen again scores of disappearances have followed. Staff at the bus station have witnessed, on many occasions, the macabre arrival of baggage belonging to migrants on board coaches from the interior, with no one to claim them. In Nuevo Laredo last month, Aarón Méndez, manager of a Presbyterian shelter, was abducted after refusing to hand over those in his care to a unit of gunmen. Ten years ago, Sandra Rodríguez was mourning the loss of her colleague on Juárez’s daily newspaper, El Diario. Armando Rodríguez was shot dead in his car as he prepared to take his daughter to school in November 2008. Sandra Rodríguez took the same risks, wrote the same kind of stories for which her friend died. She was preoccupied by what she called “the culture of impunity in this city, from its very design, to the way the economy works from the street to the top”. She published an important book of reportage from the city in 2012, La Fábrica del Crimen (The Crime Factory), which was published in English as The Story of Vicente, Who Murdered His Mother, His Father and His Sister, which he did.Rather than write about capos and sicarios, Rodríguez’s subject is the brutalisation of Mexican society. Vicente did what he did, he said, “porque puedo”, because I can.Over the past decade, Rodríguez reflects, “the story of Mexico is as Vicente predicted: you can do whatever you want, with impunity. You can kill whoever you want, kill in broad daylight, kill a journalist, disappear 43 students – and get away with it. Vicente has become a metaphor for the whole country.”As news editor, Rodríguez faces a dilemma. “We have a picture,” she says, “of two people walking past a corpse, and they don’t even glance at it – this is Juárez after 10 years. I want it on the front page, but my editor says: we don’t have a story to go with this, and he’s right. Or we have a 16-year-old killed, without a birth certificate or school record. Again, this should be front-page news. But it’s not: people being killed is no longer news in Juárez, or the rest of Mexico – killing has become normal and crime has become a habit.”Rodríguez has since lost another friend, Miroslava Breach, an investigative journalist from her home town of Chiuhuahua, murdered in 2017 when leaving home, like Armando. Twelve journalists have been killed in Mexico so far this year, so that – according to a report on US National Public Radio last month, Mexico has overtaken Syria as the most dangerous country in the world for journalists. On the day I crossed from El Paso to Juárez this time, a correspondent from National Geographic was shot and wounded.“It’s outrageous,” says Rodríguez. “It comes from the same disease, impunity. They do it because they know they can, to silence the press.” And yet, for all this, when a friend in our company asks: “Have you ever been really happy?” Rodríguez does not hesitate: “Yes, my city makes me happy. I love Juárez it kills people, but gives me life.”Kill it certainly does. The culture of impunity, says Rodríguez, has its roots in the 90s, “with the killing of 300 women in this city, when we realised nothing would happen to the killers”. The so-called “Femicidio” brought Juárez to the attention of the world, and me back to the city in 1999. The misogynist “style” of killing – a word used “not lightly” by anthropologist Cecilia Ballí in Amexica – seemed to take the violence to another level. In her thesis, Ballí explored this “sexual murder” in the light of a “hypermasculinity in US-Mexico border zones, informed by the history, style and logic of militarisation and organised crime”.Among the mothers who suffered unfathomable grief at the abduction, violation and murder of a daughter was Paula Flores, the body of whose 17-year-old daughter Maria Sagrario González was found dumped in the desert in April 1998. She had disappeared after leaving home early to take a bus to work in one of Juárez’s hundreds of maquiladora assembly plants, bedrock of the city’s economy. My chapter on the Femicidio opened with Paula imploring the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which Sagrario wore around her neck: “Where were you when they did this to my little girl?”Flores’s face has changed remarkably little since I last saw her 10 years ago, or indeed since I first interviewed her in 1999 and again in 2002. It carries that same wounded but indomitable fortitude. She lives in the same house, attached to the family’s grocery store at the top of the Anapra barrio, a quarter called Lomas de Poleo, on the north-western outskirts of town, right against the border. An old, repainted American school bus grinds up the dusty slope, with the mountains behind El Paso as backdrop.“Time passes,” Flores says. “It’s been 21 years now and everything is the same – nothing has happened. We are marked for life, and will remain so while there is no reckoning with what happened. There can be no recovery. And it continues: women keep disappearing, keep being murdered.”On the other hand, “I have my store, and my family. At weekends we are all together, all from Durango, though my grandchildren were born here. Eleven of them now, some of the age Maria Sagrario was, and that can be traumatic.”In 2005, a man called José Luis Hernández was jailed for the murder of Maria Sagrario – sentenced for 28 years. “But I fear he will be out much sooner,” says Flores. That is not the end of the matter: “He said he was paid $800 to be part of this. But by whom? Who else was involved, and why? We have always said that everything rests with the authorities, that the authorities were complicit in the murder of women in Juárez.“Every year, on the anniversary – 16 April – we get together and repaint the crosses,” says Flores – they are black on a pink background, painted or placed on walls, lamp-posts and public spaces around the city. In 2012, the mayor of Juárez, Hector Murguía, announced he would ban this practice and “apply the law” on defacement of public space. “He threatened us, but we did it,” says Flores, though “this year only four of us turned up.”The mothers of six murdered women, including Flores, filed a suit – Silvia Elena Rivera Morales et al vs Mexico – through the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, over the authorities’ abrogation of responsibility. A hearing was held in Washington DC on 29 September. “Though my daughter’s case is from 21 years ago,” Flores told the commission, “I still feel the same pain of my daughter not being here. She deserves justice.”“Yes,” she says now in her kitchen, “with the other mothers, we’re still pushing this. It was all very nice there in Washington, and the president of the court offered his sympathies. But they’ve had this case since 2007, and it’s a verdict we need, not sympathy. I don’t think they have any idea of the emotional toll, the pain involved.”Flores seems rightly exhausted with trying to find words for the unspeakable. Two of her other daughters arrive, and there’s a delicious lunch of spicy beans, cheese and tortillas, a portrait of Maria Sagrario staring down from the back wall. There’s discussion of music, grandchildren, climate crisis and life around the barrio. We’re done for today with what Edgar Allan Poe called “the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer themselves to be revealed”.But there’s one final question: where was the Virgin of Guadalupe when they did that? “I asked the same question to the cross on her coffin, and the virgin on her locket: why didn’t she protect her?” says Flores, “and I’ve asked it every day since, and I hear no answer. I still believe. But how can it be? Maria Sagrario was not against God she was a believer, she sang in church, and helped at Sunday school. During Lent that year, I prayed for the protection of my daughters. Three days later, Maria Sagrario disappeared.“I try to ask myself not so much ‘Why did she die?’ but ‘For what?’ Maybe for the school. Maybe so that with the help of the other mothers, I can raise awareness about what is happening here. So the world would take notice – maybe.”A 10th anniversary edition of Amexica by Ed Vulliamy will be published by Vintage books next year.To donate to Visión En Acción, visit visioninactionrescueasylum"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/176825988c28f63ebdd9677a6ec5cc99ef61154c/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc74d595a931e1f01bf4e8613072bc02","title":"china claims detained uighurs have been freed","story":"Xinjiang governor offers no evidence of release but says ‘trainees’ have found stable jobsChina has claimed that Uighurs and other minorities believed to be detained in Xinjiang have been freed, repeating claims made previously but offering no evidence of their release.In response to growing international criticism of the detention of as many as 1.5 million people in re-education and other internment camps, the Xinjiang governor, Shohrat Zakir, told reporters in Beijing that they had “returned to society”.China has long said it does not run what witnesses and human rights advocates have described as re-education camps, where detainees are forced to undergo political indoctrination, but offers free “vocational training” to residents who attend voluntarily.Zakir said on Monday: “At present, all the trainees who participated … have completed their studies, found stable employment with the help of the government and have improved their quality of life and live a happy life.”He said the programme focused on teaching Chinese language skills, law and vocational skills to “eliminate extremism”.However, classified government documents seen by a media consortium, including the , have undermined those claims. The documents outline a strategy to detain ethnic minorities who have not committed crimes for the sake of “educational transformation”. The directives include security measures to ensure “no escapes” and that “students” should be held for at least one year.Uighurs and Kazakhs outside China have told the  that their family members in Xinjiang remain detained in camps. Those who are not already in the camps are subject to constant surveillance, including having Chinese officials living in their homes, and live under the threat of being sent to a centre.The Uighurs are a predominantly Muslim Turkic-speaking ethnic group, primarily from China’s northwestern region of Xinjiang. They have been subject to religious and ethnic persecution by Chinese authorities, with rights groups claiming that in recent years more than 1 million people have been held in detention camps.\u0026nbspHaving initially denied the existence of the camps, China has described them as\u0026nbsp“vocational education centres”\u0026nbspin the face of mounting evidence in the form of government documents, satellite imagery and testimonies from escaped detainees. Satellite images have also suggested that more than two dozen Islamic religious sites have been partly or completely demolished since 2016.In July 2019 China claimed that most of the people sent to the mass detention centres\u0026nbsphave “returned to society”, but this has been disputed by relatives of those detained. Around 1-1.5m Uighur are estimated to live overseas as a diaspora, many of whom have campaigned against the treatment of their families. China repeated these claims in December 2019, but offering no evidence of their release.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspZakir said those reports were “pure fabrication” but declined to give the number of those attending the centres. He said the number of people who took part was “dynamic” and could not be estimated.In recent days, Beijing has mounted an aggressive propaganda campaign in response to growing criticism of its policies in Xinjiang. Last Friday the state broadcaster CCTV released a documentary called Fighting Terrorism in Xinjiang, which included footage of terrorist attacks. Over the last year, China has put on several curated, state-organised trips to the region.The remarks represent an escalation in rhetoric directed at the US, as Washington and Beijing remain locked in a trade war that has lasted more than a year. Beijing has also labeled the US a “black hand” behind ongoing anti-government protests in Hong Kong.The roots of the dispute come from US president Donald Trump’s “America first” project to protect the US’ position as the world’s leading economy, while encouraging businesses to hire more workers in the US and to manufacture their products there.Trump complains of a large trade deficit with China, which he views as a symbol of the US’s decline as a manufacturing powerhouse. Chinese imports to the US totalled $539.5bn last year, while $120.3bn was sold the other way – leaving a trade deficit of $419.2bn.The president has accused Beijing of “unfair” trade policies, including allowing the theft of US companies’ intellectual property. The threat of import tariffs on Chinese goods is being used as leverage in talks where Trump is seeking changes to Beijing’s trade policy.Tariffs have been imposed by Washington on some Chinese goods sold in the US for about a year. They came on top of broader tariffs used by Trump that have hit China and other trading partners such as the EU, Canada and Mexico, on goods including steel and aluminium.However, talks in November 2019 aimed at easing tensions were welcomed as the beginning of a thaw in the trade war between the two nations.Richard Partington and Jasper JollyLast week, US politicians passed legislation that would sanction Chinese officials involved in the crackdown in Xinjiang.Zakir said: “The US is getting restless and has launched a smear campaign against Xinjiang. But no force can stop Xinjiang’s progress toward stability and development.“When the lives of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang were seriously threatened by terrorism, the US turned a deaf ear. Now that Xinjiang is steadily developing and people of all ethnicities are living and working in peace, the US feels uneasy, and attacks and smears Xinjiang.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54020335b48f8c29cc8956d55fa93a467223c52c/0_86_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a2b48ef8b79d34caf46fc686f1133d9","title":"china tells government offices to remove all foreign computer equipment","story":"Directive is likely to be a blow to US multinational companies like HP, Dell and MicrosoftChina has ordered that all foreign computer equipment and software be removed from government offices and public institutions within three years, the Financial Times reports.The government directive is likely to be a blow to US multinational companies like HP, Dell and Microsoft and mirrors attempts by Washington to limit the use of Chinese technology, as the trade war between the countries turns into a tech cold war.The Trump administration banned US companies from doing business with Chinese Chinese telecommunications company Huawei earlier this year and in May, Google, Intel and Qualcomm announced they would freeze cooperation with Huawei.By excluding China from western know-how, the Trump administration has made it clear that the real battle is about which of the two economic superpowers has the technological edge for the next two decades.This is the first known public directive from Beijing setting specific targets limiting China’s use of foreign technology, though it is part a wider move within China to increase its reliance on domestic technology.The order had come from the Chinese Communist party’s central office earlier this year, the analysts said. Two employees from cyber security firms told the paper that government clients had described the policy.Replacing all the devices and software in this timeframe will be challenging, given that many products developed for US operating systems like Windows for Microsoft. Chinese government offices tend to use desktop computers from the Chinese-owned company Lenovo, but components of the computers, including its processor chips and hard drives are made by American companies.In May, Hu Xijin, editor of the Global Times newspaper in China, said the withdrawal of sharing by US tech companies with Huawei would not be fatal for the company because the Chinese firm has been planning for this conflict “for years” and would prompt the company to develop its own microchip industry to rival America’s.“Cutting off technical services to Huawei will be a real turning point in China’s overall research and development and use of domestic chips,” he said in a social media post. “Chinese people will no longer have any illusions about the steady use of US technology.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d65770cbc2a0f7b7014f582c6e8f7c7c01b77a6/0_18_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16dffec2c6e3394ad319f6c212582cfc","title":"finland anoints sanna martin 34 as worlds youngest serving prime minister","story":"Former transport minister is country’s youngest leader ever and third female PMFinland will have the world’s youngest serving prime minister later this week when Sanna Marin, 34, is sworn in by parliament at the head of a coalition whose four other parties are all led by women, three of them in their thirties.Marin, currently the transport minister, will take over from Antti Rinne, a former trade unionist who resigned last week after just six months in office when he lost the confidence of the Centre party, a coalition partner, over his handling of a postal strike.She will become the Nordic country’s youngest ever head of government, but said on Sunday night she had “never thought about my age or gender. I think of the reasons I got into politics, and those things for which we have won the trust of the electorate.”The five-party, Social Democrat-led coalition has agreed to stay together and maintain the policy programme it announced in June, focusing on major increases in public spending on welfare and infrastructure, and a pledge to make the country carbon neutral by 2035.Finland’s third female prime minister, Marin was raised by a single mother who later entered a same-sex relationship, and was the first of her family to go to university. She will be the world’s youngest sitting prime minister: New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern is 39, while the Ukrainian Oleksiy Honcharuk is 35.She has enjoyed a rapid rise in Finnish politics since becoming head of the council of Tampere, Finland’s second biggest city, at the age of 27, and stood in for Rinne as party leader earlier this year when he had to take time off because of illness.The Social Democrats narrowly won April’s parliamentary elections ahead of the Finns on a platform promising to end years of austerity imposed by the outgoing centre-right government, which cut public spending by €4bn and reduced Finland’s debt for the first time in a decade, but made it deeply unpopular.Rinne, who became the country’s first leftist prime minister in 20 years, said the government aimed to reduce income differences through increased spending on education, pensions and social services. But he was forced to step down last week after several weeks of political crisis over a plan to cut wages for 700 postal workers.The national postal service withdrew the reform plans in November after widespread strikes, but questions soon emerged over whether or not the prime minister had previously approved the cutbacks, prompting the Centre party to declare it had lost its trust in the prime minister.The four other female party leaders in the coalition are Li Anderson, 32, who heads the the Left Alliance Maria Ohisalo, 34, of the the Green League Katri Kulmuni, 32, from the Centre party, who was named finance minister on Monday and Anna-Maja Henriksson, 55, of the Swedish People’s party.The former prime minister Alexander Stubb lauded the coalition, saying it “shows that Finland is a modern and progressive country”. Stubb tweeted: “My party is not in government, but I rejoice that the leaders of the five parties in government are female.”The timing of the change in leadership is, however, awkward for Finland, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency until the end of the year. Parliament is expected to approve the appointment of Marin and her new ministers swiftly so she can represent Finland at the next EU leaders’ summit on 12 December."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4104590.1575471402!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"here are 30 irish websites to get this year s christmas presents","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSome website we were familiar with, but many more were completely new to us.Online shopping reached its annual peak last weekend with tens of millions of euro being spent on websites – the vast majority of which are based overseas.According to the people at auction website Ebay more than one million people went on a shopping splurge shop during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday period, spending almost €150 million.Separately, PwC estimated that 33 per cent of Irish consumers shopped during the Black Friday-Cyber Monday period with an estimated 62 per cent of the shopping done online.The bulk of the money we spent online was with retailers who have only the most tenuous connections with Ireland.

In order to deal with the legal concerns, a new consultation process – which will bring in the public, industry players and others – will look at an across the board ban on all smoky fuels, including peats, turf and woods in addition to coal.The view in Government circles now, however, is that any legal challenge could not just stop the rollout of a nationwide smoky-coal ban but could potentially jeopardise the existing bans in place in Dublin, which was introduced in 1990, and 25 other urban areas.The idea, according to sources, is to test if there is an appetite for a wider ban, which would be more legally robust.In tandem with the new process, the smoky-coal ban is to be extended to a further 13 towns across the country, understood to include Killarney, Castlebar, Tullamore, and the Laytown-Bettystown conurbation in Co Meath, among others.Under the consultation, county councils not currently covered by the smoky coal ban would have the choice to opt into a new, deeper ban.Health effectsAt a meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee on the environment last week, Minister for Health Simon Harris is understood to have raised the health effects of burning smoky peat and wood.Kevin Boxer Moran, the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, is said to have objected to a ban on peat and wood burning.The Government has been under political pressure on the issue, which has been raised on numerous occasions with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in the Dáil, most recently by Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin last week. Mr Varadkar said the Government was “keen to act”.“We now know that peat briquettes and wood are as bad for air quality as smoky coal,” Mr Varadkar said. “Switching from smoky coal to those other solid fuels does nothing for air quality. There is also a serious risk of a legal challenge being taken on that basis that could bring the entire smoky-coal ban down. We do not want to risk that happening because that would be bad for air quality as well. We are, however, moving towards a solution.”‘Terrible indictment’Mr Martin said it was a “terrible indictment of the Government that it is not standing up to vested interests from outside the State that are threatening to sue” and urged to enactment of a nationwide ban.It had initially been promised that long-planned legislation on such a ban would come into effect in September 2019."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4108924.1575893800!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"storm atiyah 7 000 homes without power as wind speeds exceed lorenzo","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Storm Atiyah makes landfall at Cromwell Point lighthouse, Valentia Island, Co Kerry.

Photograph: Reuters Ronan McGreevy Seven thousand homes are without power on Monday after Storm Atiyah passed over Ireland overnight leaving fallen trees and flights and ferries cancelled in its wake.ESB Networks is reporting a large number of faults across the country although many of the faults appear to affect relatively small numbers of properties. At the peak of Storm Atiyah, 27,000 customers were without power, most of them in the southwest counties of Kerry and Cork. Among the larger faults were more than 800 homes and businesses without power in Loughatalla, Co Tipperary while several hundred homes are without power in Inch, Co Kerry. More than 300 homes and businesses in Midleton, Co Cork have had power restored. An ESB spokesman said they hoped to have power restored to all premises by Monday evening. Wind speeds for Storm Atiyah exceeded those for Storm Lorenzo in October. Speeds of 128 kmh were recorded at Newport, Co Mayo and Roches Point, Co Cork. By contrast the top wind speed from Lorenzo was 108 kmh. Kerry was subject to a red weather warning during Storm Atiyah which anticipated wind speeds in excess of 130kmh, but the top speed recorded at Valentia Observatory in the county was 115kmh. There was quite a few trees down as a consequence of the storm and the ListowelAthea Road remains closed between the turn-offs for Abbeyfeale and Moyvane due to a fallen tree.The ESB Powercheck website - which tracks and provides updates on power faults - estimates power should be restored to many of these customers before lunchtime. Cork airport saw nine inbound flights cancelled, from Manchester, London Heathrow, Birmingham, Glasgow and Edinburgh, while other flights already en route were erted to Dublin - including one from Malta and another from Gatwick. Two flights, also due to land in Cork, were erted to Shannon Airport - one from Budapest and another from London as gusts at the airport reached 85kmh.There were numerous reports of fallen trees around Co Cork and in Co Kerry council crews were out clearing debris and a shed which had blown from a garden onto a main road near Murrioch, Ballydavid.

Photograph: Vesa MoilanenAt just 34 years old, Sanna Marin is about to make history as she becomes the world’s youngest prime minister. The Finnish social democrat won her party’s backing over the weekend, and is set to be confirmed on Tuesday.Marin will need to govern a five-party coalition that just ousted her predecessor, Antti Rinne, after he stumbled on a number of key issues. In the end, he was toppled in a dispute centring on pay at the state postal company.Marin will lead a government at a younger age even than New Zealand’s premier Jacinda Ardern, who was 37 at the time of her appointment. North Korea’s Kim Jong Un was under 30 when he became supreme leader in 2011. Going further back in history, William Pitt the Younger stands out, becoming Britain’s prime minister at just 24 in 1783.Finland’s new leader – the third woman to hold the position – will take over after the ruling coalition on Sunday agreed to keep working together to advance its existing policy programme. But she faces a tough start after Rinne’s demise just six months into his first term left rifts across the government.Marin had a chance to demonstrate her leadership skills earlier this year, when she stood in for Rinne while he was recovering from a serious illness.The peculiarities of Finland’s parliamentary system led to about 60 social democrats being in a position to pick the country’s next premier. Snap elections are a distant possibility and not automatically triggered by the government’s resignation. What’s more, parties have considerable leeway in selecting their own ministers.The Center Party on Monday announced a partial reshuffle, with its leader Katri Kulmuni becoming finance minister in a swap with Mika Lintila, who takes on the economy minister’s role.Among the social democrats, Europe minister Tytti Tuppurainen will also supervise government shareholdings, and Sirpa Paatero resumes oversight of local government. Timo Harakka takes over from Marin as minister for transport and communications, and Tuula Haatainen becomes employment minister.Marin says her first task will be to rebuild confidence across party lines within her coalition. “There’s a lot of work to be done to rebuild trust,” she told reporters after the party vote. “We are still committed to a common policy programme, and that’s the glue that unifies us as the government.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4109275.1575877489!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"denis staunton s uk election diary polls indicate tory majority","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPrime minister Boris Johnson at Conservative campaign headquarters call centre, London. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireIt’s three days to Election Day and Boris Johnson will spend much of the next 72 hours in the Labour-held seats that voted Leave in 2016 which he sees as his path to a Conservative majority.“Delivery of the required infrastructure, associated systems and staffing to implement the requirements of the protocol by December 2020 represents a major strategic, political and operational challenge,” it says. Johnson’s push through Labour-held seats in Wales, the Midlands and the north of England comes as polls continue to give the Conservatives an average lead of about 10 points, which should be enough to secure a comfortable majority. An advanced analysis by Datapraxis of almost half a million YouGov polling responses points to a Tory majority of 38 seats.As chief executive Paul Hilder writes in Prospect, this is down from Datapraxis’s projection of a 48-seat majority two weeks ago and Thursday’s election could produce anything from a hung parliament to a Tory landslide. Tactical voting could make a big difference to the outcome, particularly in the Remain-leaning south of England where some high-profile Conservatives are at risk if the anti-Tory vote consolidates. Among them is former Conservative leader and arch-Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith, whose Chingford and Woodford Green seat is so vulnerable that Johnson went there himself to campaign yesterday.Duncan Smith’s Labour challenger is economist Faiza Shaheen and her appeal is evident in this superb campaign video. The most popular choice for this year’s “Portillo moment” would be foreign secretary Dominic Raab, whose majority of more than 23,000 should make his Esher and Walton seat among the safest in the country. But demographic changes, a surge in young voter registration and tactical voting could give the Liberal Democrats one of the most dramatic upsets of the election on Thursday night.Tom McTague in the Atlantic hears from Northern unionists and loyalists.“Come on folks, help me out here!

Photograph: Enda O’DowdTensions over Brexit and the unpopularity of party leaders Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have made this UK general election one of the most vicious in living memory.Wexford student Olivia Malone, a canvasser for Labour MP Laura Smith who is defending a wafer-thin majority of 48 on her surprise 2017 win in the Cheshire constituency of Crewe and Nantwich, says this election is stirring stronger tensions than last year’s Eighth Amendment campaign that legalised abortion in Ireland.Malone, a member of Labour’s youth wing, has canvassed for the party’s candidates across the northwest of England.“I got a man who shouted at me for supporting Jeremy Corbyn saying he is a terrible leader and a terrorist supporter and all this mad stuff,” said the Irish teenager who is concerned about assaults on canvassers.Banned solo canvassingLabour banned solo canvassing after a female volunteer in her 70s was assaulted in the Herefordshire town of Bromyard last week.One elderly man outside St Mary’s church in the centre of the market town of Nantwich told The  that this was “the most evil election in our country that I have known in my lifetime”. He declined to say how he would vote.Standing at the back of Labour’s campaign office in Crewe, Malone was among about 75 people gathered to hear a pep talk from Smith on Saturday before heading out to canvass in the railway town.Labour councillor from Warrington Amanda King gave campaign workers advice on what to do if they encountered angry people on the doorsteps who might say, “Oh no, not Brexit. Oh no, not Jeremy”.“Kill them with kindness is my view. Always be kind with someone on the doorstep. There has been a couple of altercations on the doorstep so do everything in pairs,” King told them.Strong oppositionIn Crewe and Nantwich, a top Conservative target for its candidate Dr Kieran Mullan, Smith is facing strong opposition over Corbyn as leader and the party’s stance to put a new Brexit deal to the people.“It is on a knife-edge,” said the constituency Labour Party chairman Connor Naismith.He acknowledged that the party’s position was not popular with leave voters and that Corbyn was not liked by some Labour voters. He says some of them did not like Tony Blair or Gordon Brown either.On Brexit, he said Smith was showing a “kind of pragmatism”.“We all recognise this is a ided country. The referendum split families in half, it split personal relationships in half and Laura has done her best to try and represent both sides of that argument,” he said.Concerns about the reception campaign volunteers receive on the doorsteps has spread to Ireland.“My mother told me on the phone the other day, ‘I would be worried about you going out there now’,” said Malone.Can Boris Johnson get a majority and finally deliver Brexit?

Video: Enda O\u0027Dowd\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKevin Harper, whose father emigrated from Kilkeel, Co Down, is the Brexit party’s candidate for the Bolsover area. Photograph: Enda O’Dowd Bridget Mouncey declares herself a “Dennis Skinner fan” and plans to vote for the veteran Labour MP in Bolsover, the old Derbyshire mining town in the north of England.Her daughter Tammy White, juggling busy eight-month-old Amber on her lap, is not so sure about voting for the last parliament’s second-longest serving MP in Thursday’s UK general election.“Are we ready for somebody new to come in and get things moving?” she says of a man first elected in 1970.Carrie-Anne Hollinshead, at their table during a Bolsover charity coffee morning, is struggling with something dominating this election campaign: trust.She is undecided. She does not believe Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his promise-heavy manifesto of big-ticket spending items to help the less well-off.“I don’t trust that he is going to bring half the things that he is saying he is going to bring. If he is, I’d like to see where his money tree is,” she said.Like many in this market town, Hollinshead recognises that Bolsover is more than just a constituency fight. This is a battleground for the nation as the Tories look to take a Labour stronghold in a heavy leave-voting constituency (71 per cent) with their promise to “get Brexit done” amid Labour’s prevarication on the issue.‘A bit tricky’Boris Johnson and the Tories see Bolsover as a constituency that can help return them to power with a majority so they can push through Johnson’s Brexit deal with the EU and get the UK out by January 31st.“I don’t feel we are voting for the constituency, but for the parliament. I don’t think I could vote for Corbyn but I don’t know who I could vote for. I don’t trust the Conservatives either. It is a bit tricky,” said Hollinshead.The three women, all traditional Labour voters, are sipping tea in Bolsover’s Hilltown Methodist Church at a “free cafe”organised by the Freedom Community Project, a charity established to help the poorest in the region manage their lost benefits, advise on mounting loans and feed the hungry.White is a social worker and says the last nine years of social welfare cuts by the Tories have been “very difficult” for an area ravaged like Bolsover.‘Food parcels’“It is sad really that you have got to have places like this and they are getting busier and busier. We notice more and more food parcels going out,” she said.Mark North, chief executive of Freedom, says Bolsover’s poor are not just coming in hungry these days but have no money for gas or electricity to cook the free food they receive. He is seeing increasing numbers of working people who are homeless and a level of poverty here “that is Dickensian really.”This is driving political apathy and a sense of powerlessness and isolation among the people that fed Bolsover’s big Brexit vote, he says.It is leading to a growing trend of people who feel left behind by the main parties and are voting for Independents. Labour lost control of the local district council in May’s local elections for the first time since its inception.“There is a lot of blame against politicians full stop, no matter what political party,” said North.Ross Walker, a former Labour man elected an independent councillor in May, says Skinner, a former miner, “has been in parliament longer than I have been alive.”Speaking against the backdrop of Bolsover’s supposedly haunted castle, he feels Bolsover needs to break from the past.“Labour have totally ignored people around here. Independents are free from those party politics, from all that baggage,” said Walker who is one of six candidates standing against Skinner in the election.It says something about Labour’s standing in Bolsover during this unusual election that after a near-decade of austerity under Conservative governments - in a former mining area with a deeply ingrained, intergenerational animosity towards Tories – that the party could find themselves in trouble here.Over in nearby Shirebrook, a town that once employed 2,200 miners, Alan Gascoyne, a former trade union official working for Shirebrook Miners Welfare, says he would “rather chop my hand off than vote Tory.”He is stunned that former miners are contemplating voting Conservative in order to get Brexit done and to keep Corbyn out.“They say, ‘we might vote Tory this time but if they get a new leader, then we will come back to Labour when they put Brexit to one side,” said Gascoyne.“It is odd,” he adds, diplomatically.Doctor’s ordersSome locals complain that they have rarely seen the 87-year-old Skinner in this campaign or before. The Labour man, known as “the beast of Bolsover,” had a hip replacement recently and is under doctor’s orders to limit his activity.Other constituents see Skinner’s problems lying solely with Corbyn. The Labour leader is proving so toxic among Labour supporters in Bolsover that he could lead to one of the party’s stalwarts losing of his job of almost 50 years.“I voted Labour all my life. I wouldn’t vote for Corbyn if you paid me. I don’t like the guy. There is something about him,” said Don Harley, standing in Bolsover’s public market with his Irish Glen of Imaal Terriers Cody and Libby.“I think he would do this country down if he got into No 10. He cannot make his mind up: we will leave, we will stay,” said his wife Val.The couple, who both voted leave in the 2016 referendum, will be voting for the Brexit Party on Thursday.That party’s candidate Kevin Harper says Skinner has not helped his case by blocking a “clean-break Brexit” by voting against successive deals.“I think he has had his day here,” he said.Anne Western, a volunteer at his campaign office, defends Skinner’s stance on Brexit against charges that he has failed to deliver on the people’s will.Skinner, a life-long Eurosceptic, wants out of the EU but “on terms that don’t damage people’s lives,” she says.“We think it is going to be tight, but it is certainly not lost,” she says of the election.This kind of defensive talk would have been unthinkable 22 years ago when Skinner won by a majority of 27,149 votes. That narrowed to 5,288 in the 2017 general election. Both long-time and one-time Labour supporters believe it could disappear completely this week.“The beast has lost his teeth,” said his rival Walker."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.General election 2019: Tory voters are \u0026#39coming home\u0026#39 to Boris, polling chief says as research shows lead at 14 pointsWinter solstice 2019: Why do pagans celebrate the shortest day of the year?The billionaire vs the socialist: how John Caudwell took on John McDonnell on BBC Radio over his plans to soak the richComment: After three elections, we may end up talking ourselves into a truly ided BritainComment: It\u0026#39s looking good for Boris, but we shouldn\u0026#39t take anything for granted Manifesto watch: what has each party promised in their 2019 general election campaign?Will tactical voting work in the 2019 election?

Data gathered by digital marketing firm SemRush noted an\u0026nbsp80 per cent correlation between search volume and bitcoin\u0027s price, though no conclusions were drawn as to which was the determining factor.Some analysts previously suggested that\u0026nbsptraders may be manipulating Google searches in order to artificially inflate the price of bitcoin.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On average they had negative financial and property wealth of £4,900 in 2018, up from £3,900 in 2014.The data also highlights a growing regional ide. Total wealth in London has jumped almost 80 per cent since 2008 while the east midlands and northeast are both more than 10 per cent down. London also has the largest ide between wealthy and poor citizens of any UK region.Robert Palmer, executive director of Tax Justice UK, said: “These figures reveal that wealth inequality has increased over the past decade and remains stubbornly high. This has real-world consequences. Access to wealth gives you more life opportunities and better health.”\u0026nbsp“Inequality has been a major talking point in this election. Taxing wealth more has to be part of the solution if we are to get the public services voters consistently say they want.”The wealth boom has not been mirrored in wage growth, with average wages still slightly below a peak reached in 2008. Household debt, including loans and credit cards, is also rising, up 11 per cent to £119bn in the two years to March 2018.George Bangham, research analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While incomes have stagnated over the past decade, our national wealth has continued to boom.“But the UK’s £14.6 trillion of wealth is highly concentrated and unequally spread. The richest 10 per cent of households have benefitted most from the recent wealth boom, and own almost half of the nation’s wealth.\u0026nbsp“In contrast, typical households in parts of the north and midlands are still no wealthier than they were before the financial crisis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell?

(EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Guy Pearce, Andy Serkis, Stephen Graham and Charlotte Riley will star in a “unique and original take” on Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol that promises to be a “haunting, hallucinatory, spine-tingling immersion into Scrooge’s dark night of the soul”.The Christmas Misadventures of Romesh Ranganathan, BBC2, 9pmRomesh Ranganathan is back with a Christmas special of his comedy travel show.

Instagram doesn\u0027t offer the feature, however, so you will have to go elsewhere.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThankfully, you don\u0027t have to pick through all your pictures and find out the best ones: there\u0027s plenty of websites available to do that for you. The best one appears to be topnine.co, which includes some extra features like the ability to see how many likes you managed to get over the entire year.Last year, that site ran into issues\u0026nbspin some countries, such as the UK,\u0026nbspperhaps because of more stringent privacy rules. Those seem to have been fixed this time.But if there are problems, you can still head\u0026nbspto the 2019bestnine site\u0026nbspas an alternative. It\u0027s not quite as neat, runs quite slowly and sticks a fairly ugly watermark on the bottom, but it includes some clever features, such as the ability to choose any date range that you like.Whichever one you use, just head to that site, give it your username, and it\u0027ll sort everything out from there. You can even give it someone else\u0027s username, should you want to see their best nine.​Instagram\u0027s latest update forces new users to reveal their ageThe site finds out which of your posts received the most likes, assembling them into a collage of nine pictures. You can then opt to share it to your Instagram – or do whatever else you like, such as sending it directly to your friends or uploading it to your story.​The feature might take a while to compile your picture and so asks for an email address so that it can notify you of when your best nine is ready. While its privacy policy allows it to use that email for marketing, it does allow you to opt out – but if you\u0027re anxious about it, it might be worth quickly setting up a disposable email account just to make sure your address stays safe.That website – unlike some other, more questionable tools – doesn\u0027t require that you give it your login or the ability to access your account, since all the data that it needs to make the collage is public anyway. Since there are safe tools like that around, make sure not to use one that requires you to give any account information at all, since it is unnecessary and can put you at risk of having your profile used maliciously or even hacked.But for the same reason, the tool will only work for public profiles. Since it works by scraping the information from your profile, if you\u0027ve locked it down you won\u0027t be able to see the results.One option is simply to switch very quickly to a public profile, make your collage, and then switch back. As long as you do it quickly then it is unlikely anyone will notice.Another option is to make your own best nine, by picking through your photos and then arranging them into a collage using Instagram\u0027s own Layout app. That has the advantage of allowing you to choose any photos you wish you were included but aren\u0027t – but the downside of having to pick manually through what might be hundreds of photos.A version of this article was first published in 2018Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I just speak about the s*** we all see. That’s why your vote matters.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn the track, the east-London rapper urges the elderly to listen to their grandchildren and vote on their behalf.“F*** how you wanna live now, this is about how you wanna move forward,” he raps. “All you OAPs out there, who are probably gonna die in the next 10 years anyway, why don’t you ask your 1516 year-old grandkids who they’d vote for if they could and go vote for them.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The 50 best albums of the decade – 2010 to 2019 Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument.

(JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. “Your generation’s already f***ed up the environment for them,” he continues. “How about not f***ing up their futures for them as well?”Plan B concludes with summing up what a vote for each party would entail.“Vote Tory if you wanna be free from European influence and become the 51st state of the US when it comes to trading,” he raps. “Or vote Labour and have another referendum on whether we leave the EU now that everyone’s more informed about the situation.Dua Lipa urges followers to vote Labour in 2019 general electionKano and Steve Coogan among 40 cultural figures backing LabourChris Martin says he’ll ‘probably’ vote for Lib Dems in electionHe continues, “If you’re worried about Jeremy stifling wealth creation and don’t wanna vote for Boris because you f***ing hate him, then vote Lib Dem in the constituencies they have a realistic stake in. “Or the Green Party, I hear some of you shouting.”Listen to “First Past the Post” here.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We don’t do road bikes, as too dangerous,” he said.\u0026nbsp“I was hit by a truck and almost died on one when I was 17.”Mr Musk has consistently said that electric vehicles are needed in every vehicle category in order to solve sustainable energy, with the Cybertruck and ATV part of his attempts to fulfill this.Despite the mishap during the Cybertruck’s unveiling – when two armoured windows were smashed by a metal ball – Tesla’s latest model has proved to be one of the most popular all-electric vehicles of all time.Within one week of the truck’s unveiling it had racked up more than 250,000 pre-orders and generated more than $25 million worth of down payments.It may still be years away from launch but it was recently spotted driving on public roads in Howthorne, California.The electric ATV shares the same futuristic design as the Cybertruck and is built to be transported and charged on the bed of the truck.Pre-orders are not yet available for the Cyberquad and it is still not listed on Tesla’s website.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On average they had negative financial and property wealth of £4,900 in 2018, up from £3,900 in 2014.The data also highlights a growing regional ide. Total wealth in London has jumped almost 80 per cent since 2008 while the east midlands and northeast are both more than 10 per cent down. London also has the largest ide between wealthy and poor citizens of any UK region.Robert Palmer, executive director of Tax Justice UK, said: “These figures reveal that wealth inequality has increased over the past decade and remains stubbornly high. This has real-world consequences. Access to wealth gives you more life opportunities and better health.”\u0026nbsp“Inequality has been a major talking point in this election. Taxing wealth more has to be part of the solution if we are to get the public services voters consistently say they want.”The wealth boom has not been mirrored in wage growth, with average wages still slightly below a peak reached in 2008. Household debt, including loans and credit cards, is also rising, up 11 per cent to £119bn in the two years to March 2018.George Bangham, research analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While incomes have stagnated over the past decade, our national wealth has continued to boom.“But the UK’s £14.6 trillion of wealth is highly concentrated and unequally spread. The richest 10 per cent of households have benefitted most from the recent wealth boom, and own almost half of the nation’s wealth.\u0026nbsp“In contrast, typical households in parts of the north and midlands are still no wealthier than they were before the financial crisis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But how can you not have a table How do you eat  Where do you have coffee  What do you put your shopping on when you come home  And where do you sityou want to read something  Which brings me on to another astonishing fact. Today, in Britain, , children do not own a single book.Obviously, I’m aware that children would much rather shoot an alien in the face than read some drivel by Jane Austen. And I get that. I’d rather gouge my own eyes out with a trowel than read anything by Jane Austen. And I’d certainly rather play Call Of Duty.I’ll admit, too, that book people spend far too much time being bookish and earnest with other book people. Which is why the book that wins the Booker Prize is always more impenetrable than a Hawthorn bush.It’s usually just a lot of women wondering about flowers. Have I read either of this year’s joint winners  No. I’d rather eat my own sick. But the idea of living in a house with no books at all is actually quite frightening.Because then there’d be no Winnie The Pooh, and more worryingly, no Jack Reacher.They’ve tried to capture the essence of this man mountain on television and, hilariously, with Tom Cruise in the role at the cinema, but nothing beats the books. They’re all the same. Jack walks into a small town in America. He has some coffee. Notices a pretty girl. Punches eight men in the face. Sleeps with the pretty girl. Saves the town from the baddies by punching them all in the face and then walks off at the end.I swear to God thatyou could get your kids to put down their phones for a day, and read a Jack Reacher book, they’d never want to do social media again. I know that’s impossible. I know you can’t get a kid to put down its phone for more than  seconds. I’m just saying thatyou could . . .So what about school  Kids are made to read by teachers, but the books they select are always as dull as being dead. Andyou make kids read boring books for exams, they will grow up to hate reading.So ditch Austen and Donne and Shakespeare and Milton. Put them on the top shelf of a library and leave them there. Instead, to make reading fun, make them study Jack Reacher and books by Jilly Cooper and Jeffrey Archer.Even EL Jamesthat’s what it takes. Anything that gets them reading. Anything that makes books cool. It won’t work for everyone of course. Some kids will not enjoy a book no matter how good the story might be.But that’s OK. They can go off and do carpentry instead. Then they could make the family a table.APPARENTLY,  people complained about a raunchy appearance by the Pussycat Dolls on last weekend’s X Factor final.Some say the performance was “shameful” while others said the “strip show” was “absolutely disgraceful”.I couldn’t agree more. We sat through a rubbish song and at the end, they were wearing exactly the same amount of clothing as they had been at the start.But almost all of them these days are NEVER seen in public without a phone in one hand and . . . a plastic bottle of water in the other.I don’t know when it became compulsory to have water about your person at all times, but it’s stupid.Yes. You need wateryou are in the desert and you’re hundreds of miles from a tap and it’s C.But at all other times, you should drink beer.Because that comes in a glass bottle that doesn’t end up wrapped round some poor unfortunate sea creature’s head.AFTER about three hours my back bottom went to sleep but the rest of me was still gripped by Martin Scorsese’s new epic, The Irishman.Mostly, however, I was gripped by how badly the phenomenally expensive de-ageing technology works.It’s used in flash- backs to turn ageing stars Robert De Niro and Al Pacino into younger men but it makes them look like Bill and Ben.And their plastic faces are at odds with their elderly bodies.Pity. I was rather hoping we could use tech like this in the next Grand Tour to make me look like Charles Leclerc.It’s reckoned that David has climbed  places in the list of most popular boys’ names thanks to the work done by David Attenborough.Really. But what about those who are naming their kids after David Cameron, or David Jason Or even the popular television channel.That’s what I’d doI had another kid.Call it Amazon. Good name actually.I SEE Q Branch has fitted James Bond’s rebuilt Aston Martin DB with mini guns that pop out from behind the headlights.That’s excellent, as a brace of these fearsome weapons can fire , rounds a minute. That’s  every second.The trouble is, that they can’t. I once flew a helicopter that had been fitted with miniguns on its skids and every time I pulled the trigger, one bullet would set off in the wrong direction and then the gun would jam.There’s another issue too. If Bond’s car carries enough bullets for two minutes of sustained fire, he’d need , bullets. Which together would weigh around ,lb. Oh, and the ammo storage box would be huge, too.These, then, are weapons that only really work on the screen. When they’re not actually firing anything at all.ELDERLY residents in the seaside town of Bournemouth started a petition as soon as they heard that a “pot shop” was due to open in their community.They said: “The area already struggles massively with anti-social behaviour and the last thing the community needs is an establishment promoting the use of narcotics right opposite impressinable youngsters.”Couple of things on that. They spelled “impressionable” wrong. And more importantly, the pot shop that had got them so riled was going to sell . . . pottery.This is a bit like that story from a while ago where angry locals daubed slogans and smashed windows of the house of the local paediatrician.Because they thought the brass plaque on the door said “paedophile”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s not true this time: it is the MOST IMPORTANT VOTE in our letimes.At stake is whether we leave the EU or not. You may think that was settled by the Brexit referendum — and it should have been. But any result other than a Tory majority will lead to more efforts to overturn the referendum result.It will mean another year when politicians argue about whether to accept what people voted for in June , rather than focusing on schools, hospitals and all the other domestic issues that matter so much.There are TWO POSSIBLE RESULTS in this election: a Tory majority or another hung Parliament. Even John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, is talking about how Labour would try to governit didn’t have a majority.Another hung Parliament would be more of the same: Parliamentary gridlock and no progress. What would a Parliament without a majority for any party be able to agree on beyond a second referendum It is not even certain it could do that. You would need a government for a second referendum and Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, has said she would rather have another election than put either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn into No.So we may well all be heading to the polls AGAIN in Februarythere is no clear result this time. Eventhey could unite on a second referendum, they wouldn’t be able to agree on much . It would be a single-issue government, to the detriment of everything .When Labour make extravagant promises it has a double credibility problem. First, how will it pay for them  It is not realistic to say you can fund spending equivalent to half an NHS every year just by taxing the rich and big business a bit more.Second, will they actually happen given that Labour won’t win a majority  In a hung Parliament, Labour will only be able to do those things that Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish Nationalists and the Liberal Democrats agree to.By contrast, a Tory majority government would not be more of the same. It would break the Brexit deadlock. This country would leave on January . This will not settle the question of Britain’s future relationship with the EU, but it will mean that Brexit won’t continue to suck up all of Parliament’s energies.A majority government is also more easily held to account. If the Tories win one, then at the next election voters will be able to seethey have delivered on what they said that would do: There will  be no excuses and no hiding places. Right now, the Tories are on course for a majority. I understand their own internal numbers indicate a working majority.But these margins are very fine, and victory could slip awayvoters don’t turn out. If Boris Johnson does win a majority next week, it will be because he has presented himself as change. Not just the person who can break the deadlock, but a leader with a dferent agenda to the one the Tories have had these past nine years.As Prime Minister of a majority government, he would have to deliver on that agenda. He would have to create the conditions for the economy to flourish far outside London and the South East, he would have to improve the NHS and our infrastructure.Having been elected as a dferent kind of Tory, he will have to govern as that. This country has been in limbo for too long. It needs a Parliament that can take decisions, not just play for time.According to one campaign source: “There is still a nervousness about letting it run wild.”But there is a recognition that the Tories  need a bit of pizzazz in the last few days and that Boris  needs, “the energy of a walkabout”.The Tory plan is to “close hard”. They are, privately, cautiously optimistic.One Cabinet minister says: “In  you could feel it slipping away, it doesn’t feel like that this time.”But they have held back nearly all their online advertising budget for the last few days to guard against any last-minute swing back to Labour.FEW expected Donald Trump to be able to resist getting involved in the election on his visit here for the Nato summit.But in the end, Trump, largely, kept his views to himself.I understand that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was key in persuading him not to derail Boris Johnson’s election effort.Kushner, who has a leading role at the White House, developed a good relationship with Johnson when the latter was Foreign Secretary and was keen not to have the visit create any distractions.If he doesn’t, we will  have a second referendum where voters will be asked to choose between Remain and Remain-lite. Nigel Farage is badly miscalculating in his refusal to tell voters in Labour Tory marginals to back the Tories.If Labour hold on in seats such as High Peak in Derbys, it will be because of the Brexit Party standing in a seat that it has no chance of winning.One veteran Eurosceptic who has been part of an effort to get the Brexit Party to make clear that voters shouldn’t back it where it has no chance of winning blames Richard Tice, the Brexit Party chair and its candidate in Hartlepool, for blocking any such move.This source tells me Tice is “a nightmare, he is a far bigger problem than Farage”.This election is going to come down to fine margins. The Brexit Party vote could well let Labour hang on in some crucial seats.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thankfully he didn’t and we put years of penalty heartbreak behind us.In politics, one of those moments is coming next Thursday.We can either deliver Brexit and move forward with a Conservative majority Government, or we can have more Brexit delay, more arguing in Parliament, and two more referendums in  under Jeremy Corbyn. Next Thursday, I’m asking many dferent people to come on a journey with me. People who always vote Conservative. People who used to but lost faith. People who never have before.All of you who do are putting your trust in me. And I don’t take that lightly at all. Yet I feel so positive about our future as a country outside the EU. There’s so much we can achieve as well as lots we need to improve too.It won’t always be easy. We won’t always agree.

But we are also their role models in terms of food choices. If we breakfast on Pringles, pizza and doughnuts then the odds are they will too.By the same token,we start the day with porridge, seeds and fruit, they’ll likely grow up assuming that’s the best way.School is a huge influence, too, and it is great Jamie did succeed. In fact, he started a nationwide trend of schools providing and promoting a healthy diet.But some schools are taking it too far. At one primary I know of, teachers and dinner ladies patrol the lunchtime tables hunting out contraband such as sugary drinks and chocolate, to confiscate it then attempt to shame the parents into submission with letters about their snack misdemeanours.Other schools, it has emerged, are taking it even further than that, with pupils being followed when school has ended.Yes, following them from the school gates to the high street to intervenethey are seen going into a takeaway.Children at Cotham School, in Bristol, have been told they are not allowed to enter at least three convenience stores and a takeaway between .pm and .pm.Not only that, but school staff acting as bouncers have been patrolling the shopping parade and standing in high-vis jackets outside the chippy.The school says it is using powers given by Michael Gove’s  Education Act, which allows it to rule over the conduct of pupils in certain circumstances outside the school gates.The school’s business manager, Allison Crossland, said teachers have the authority over what the pupils do even after the end of the school day.And they are doing so to, “ensure the safety of children on their way home from school”.According to one takeaway owner, teachers went inside and started giving out detentions to children they found in there, although the school denies this.But the takeaway shops on the street say they have seen a drop in business since Cotham School staff started patrolling the streets and, unsurprisingly, they are up in arms as a result.I’m not saying it’s great for kids to snack on high-fat or sugary food when they leave school. Of course it’s not.But is it really the responsibility of their teachers to make sure they don’t  Is it right teachers can rule on what your kids eat when they leave school I don’t think so. AndI was a parent of a child being told what to eat by someone other than me, I’d be furious.I know some people will say this comes down to money, that it’s more expensive to eat healthily.And yes, it is cheaper and easier to snack on sugary foods such as chips and biscuits.Some might say that school dinners are not satisfying enough.Parents need to take it upon themselves to learn about how to cook and eat healthily.You don’t have to spend a fortune to eat well. Look at Jack Monroe, who has written a book on how to cook well with tinned food.There is no doubt something needs to change when it comes to kids and food.The number of obese people in the UK has almost doubled in  years. Rather than paying staff to patrol the chippy, I would vote to bring back domestic science and teach all children how to cook properly from scratch.But as parents, it is our duty, and no one ’s, to look after our children and teach them how to eat well.I KNOW they were doing important work at the Nato summit and all . . . But bloody hell, it was easy for the onlooker to be distracted, wasn’t it, with all the world leaders’ power-mongering going on First of all there were the handshakes. The amount of one-upmanship that can occur in a simple greeting is staggering: Who gets to overpower who by making sure their hand is firmly on top throughout the shake.Who lets go and de-shakes first, and who insists on prolonging the handshake so enthusiastically that it is impossible for the other party to get away until the prolonger is good and ready.Donald Trump famously shakes LONG and HARD. I think it is called the Power Shake and is often employed by people who think the harder they squeeze, the more important and manly they are.They hold on to show they have control over you. But at this summit, Trump possibly met his match with Canada’s Justin Trudeau, who was repeatedly filmed gripping people’s hands so hard that both sets of knuckles were going white.Mind you, that is better than the limp shake. No one likes nor trusts someone with a limp handshake. It’s like shaking hands with a person with no bones.But my least favourite is the sweaty-palm shake.And then there was the footage of Trudeau, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Boris Johnson apparently gossiping about Trump like a bunch of naughty schoolboys.Where’s the leadership qualities in behaving like that It all left me feeling like they need to grow up.And then I saw the photo of our magnicent Queen and all  Nato allies. Guess how many women were in the group  I counted seven, including the Queen. I can’t help but thinkthere were more women involved, less of this childish stuff would go on.But it comes with at least one benefit: An utterly fabulous clothing budget!I have never seen Melania in the same outfit twice .She wore a coat a few months ago which I quite liked the look of, so I thought I might buy it.I looked it up online and it was £,, for something made out of wool. I passed! Mind you, whatever the cost, she looks great and oozes class.I SHUDDERED when I read the story of Jayney Nascimento, , who borrowed £, from her mother for liposuction in the hope of having skinnier legs. But instead of getting the legs of her dreams, she contracted a deadly flesh-eating bug called necrotising fasciitis, which left her fighting for her le and she almost had her legs amputated.Jayney, an administrator from Shropshire, says: “I paid for an expensive cosmetic procedure so I would feel comfortable showing off my legs.“Instead, I nearly lost them and I hate them more now than I did before the operation.”Talk about a sobering reminder that all cosmetic surgery is invasive and has potentially le-threatening side-effects. Is it really worth it I’m guessing this woman would say no.CHRISTIE Brinkley was photographed looking absolutely spectacular at an event in New York. Wearing this black, trenchcoat-style mini- dress, with bedazzling purse and sparkly calf boots she seemed about half her age, which is, incredibly, .If I have half of her joie de vivre and charisma at that age, I will be over the moon.And so should she be.POOR Rhodri Giggs, who told this week about the devastating effect brother Ryan’s affair with his we has had on the family. Quite understandably, he hasn’t spoken to footballer Ryan, , in eight years, since the affair with Rhodri’s we Natasha was revealed.But shockingly, he said his mother Lynne hasn’t spoken to him in the past eight years.Rhodri, , says she has taken Ryan’s side: “Because I haven’t got  medals, I haven’t played for Manchester United for -odd years and own a big house.”Turns out this was a triple betrayal. His we. His brother. His mother. Your entire support network gone overnight. Shame on his motherthat is true.DID anyone  wince over Jeremy Corbyn vowing to confront Donald Trump at this week’s Buckingham Palace reception It was about the sanctity of the NHS, which Trump does not appear to be interested in having anything to do with anyway.In the end, Corbyn didn’t get a chance as he was kept firmly away from the US President, possibly after publicly announcing his intentions.But the US is our main ally and it’s quite shocking that on a visit by the President, the opposition leader has to be kept away from Trump because he can’t be trusted to act with respect.What a calamity it would behe became the leader on December .JUST when I thought my admiration for black cab drivers had reached a peak, I got an invitation to a Christmas lunch organised by the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans.They offered Christmas lunch – turkey and all the trimmings – to  veterans who were taken to the venue by a fleet of black cabs driven by volunteer cabbies.It is so heart-warming that it actually brought a tear to my eye.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But even Corbyn has had to acknowledge that this was a lie.In fact, the sheer scale of Labour’s planned spending and borrowing mean that we’ll all have to dip into our pockets — either immediately or when the borrowing bills come due.The economy is also likely to take a sharp downturn.Corbyn’s plans to tax business and high earners mean many of them will leave the country — indeed, they’ve already got their escape plans ready.Because the Government is so reliant on taxing a few wealthy iniduals, Labour would have to drastically rein in its planned spending, or tax those who do stay even more.With higher taxes — not to mention Labour seizing ten per cent of most big companies, nationalising others and giving the unions far more power — le will get much tougher for businesses. Eventhey don’t up and leave, they’re likely to create far fewer jobs.Labour’s extra spending might compensate for some of this by stimulating the economy in the ­short term.But set against that will be the continued Brexit uncertainty as Corbyn negotiates his own deal and then either does or doesn’t back it in a second referendum.It’s very hard to see who on earth would risk investing in Britain under those circumstances.It would probably be a fairly miserable Christmas, too.Exchange rates would likely fall sharply, making anything from overseas more expensive — andyou wanted to go on holiday you’d definitely need a larger wallet.On top of all this, there’s the lurking threat of a full-on collapse.Either as people with money try to flee the country and Labour tries to stop them — orthe bond markets start refusing to lend John ­McDonnell the hundreds of billions he will need.In short, we might actually end up working a four-day week under Corbyn.But only because there weren’t enough jobs to go round.JEREMY Corbyn is “neutral” on Brexit — the biggest issue the UK has faced in a generation. Yet his deliberately vague policy will leave Britain locked in EU exit paralysis.Millions of voters won’t be neutral about that.Labour claims it will “get Brexit sorted” in six months — negotiating a new deal with Brussels, to be put to another referendum.Trying to have it both ways, Corbyn won’t tell usLabour backs Leave or Remain.Boris Johnson secured an “oven ready” exit deal. Corbyn reckons he can get a “much better” EU deal.Butthe Eurocrats know a new agreement would be followed by a referendum, with an option to Remain, they’d make sure it was utterly terrible for Britain.Then, both Leave and Remain voters would reject it — keeping Britain in and maintaining the annual flow of billions of pounds to Brussels. Brexiteers would then claim with the score at one-all, we need yet another Brexit referendum — the best of three!If Mr Corbyn grabs power after doing a deal with Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon we would face a second referendum anyway — on Scottish independence! It would be chaos.While our economy has held up quite well, the Brexit shenanigans of the past three years are now hitting growth and investment.More months and years in limbo land — over Brexit, and the break-up of the UK itself — would leave Britain deep in the economic doldrums.NEVER in history has a more dangerous man been a contender for leadership of any Western democracy.Corbyn has consistently sided with those that wish us harm. When IRA terrorists bombed the Cabinet at Brighton, his response was to invite two convicted volunteers of the murderous organisation to the House of Commons.And when Russian assassins were sent on a murder mission to Salisbury, Corbyn failed to condemn the Kremlin and called for further proof of state-sponsored involvement.He calls Hamas and Hezbollah his “friends” and appeared to take part in a ceremony honouring a terrorist involved in the Munich Olympics massacre.He said the death of Bin Laden was a tragedy and wanted the leader of IS arrested not killed. The same with British jihadists Mohammed Emwazi and Sally-Anne Jones.His deputies John McDonnell and Diane Abbott demanded the closure of MI, the security agency that protects us from terrorists.With Corbyn as PM how could our allies trust us with their most sensitive secrets The US and Israel, vital sources of le-saving intelligence, have reluctantly drawn up plans to restrict co-operation in the event of a Corbyn premiership.Corbyn has made it clear he would never press the nuclear trigger nor order troops into battle.But credible deterrence is the best way to prevent conflict. Corbyn would subvert our military deterrence and endanger British lives.YOU don’t need a crystal ball to see how a Corbyn government would behave towards Jews.Just look at how it acts in opposition — and know that it will be much, much worse.Last week, a chilling video emerged of Health Secretary Matt Hancock being jeered by Labour supporters at an Election hustings when he mentioned how sickened he was by the party’s refusal to deal with anti-Semitism.The people jeering are the same people who buttress Mr Corbyn’s leadership of the Labour Party.Instead of protecting its Jewish members from Labour racists, the party has refused to act against the racists and driven out many of the most prominent Jews.In Labour now, Jews are hounded and attackedthey refuse to denounce Israel. They are regarded as beyond the pale.In opposition, the Corbynites’ malign influence only extends to the party. In government, it would be felt far beyond. We already know how foreign alliances would be changed.Corbyn has praised as “friends” Hezbollah and Hamas — an organisation committed by charter to the extermination of every Jew on the planet. They will be welcomed as allies — another demonstration of Labour’s contempt for Jews.To cap it all, we have seen in this election the so-called moderates’ embrace of Corbyn as they snf power. Like all extremists, he will be enabled by the spineless, unprincipled careerists.No wonder the vast majority of British Jews fear the prospect of a Corbyn government.GORMLESS Corbyn has said one clear thing during this election campaign. “I ask our media,” the Labour leader declared, “as good journalists, to just report what we say.”Here’s the news, Mr Corbyn: in a free society, it is not the job of good journalists to “just report” what politicians say.It is journalists’ job to question, challenge and even, when required, ridicule what you tell us.Corbyn’s Labour are outraged by the freedom of the Press to ask awkward questions and reveal embarrassing truths.Labour want to drag us through an unnecessary and expensive “Leveson II” inquiry into the media — another show trial in which popular news-papers such as The Sun would be found guilty before the start.Corbyn would also implement Section  of the Crime and Courts Act.This threatens newspapers with the prospect of punitive court fines and costs unless they sign up to the official regulator — Britain’s first state-backed press regulation in  years.He even effectively wants to nationalise the news, with publicly-funded media outlets promoting “public interest” journalism.That’s “public interest” as defined by the authorities, not the public.In short,you want to read Government-approved journalism in a state-sponsored media — vote Labour. No questions asked.A PATHOLOGICALLY anti-motorist political era will be marshalled inCorbyn is elected.Diverting scheduled road improvement funds to railways, for example, will fleece low-income drivers to pick up more of the tab for well-off suburban commuters, while cavernous potholes get even more perilous.Corbyn’s plans to hit drivers with regular increases in fuel duty — amounting to a punitive p per litre hike — will cost White Van Man £, more per year to fill up.The cost of motoring levelled on the world’s highest-taxed drivers will skyrocket to help finance Labour’s trillion-pounds retrograde jamboree. It will restrict freedom of mobility and crash our post-Brexit economy.The cash-hustling band of Left-wing reprobates just don’t get it.The nine-year freeze in duty has never been a cost to the economy.It generates extra tax revenue due to higher consumer spending, reduced distribution costs, more jobs, lower inflation, faster growing GDP and increased company profits.Without that insightful Tory tax policy change to Labour’s  fuel tax myopia, the price of filling up would now be a crippling £. per litre, rising at seven per cent a year.A thriving low-tax economy for everyone, under a Boris Johnson-lead majority administration, is the only solution. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And business, they say, would be left with “just about the most punitive corporate tax system in the world”.Pension funds — huge investors in the utilities up for nationalisation — would be at riskshareholders are not properly compensated.Firms and the rich would flee abroad, taking their taxable billions with them.McDonnell’s plan to seize ten per cent of the shares in every big company would mean more misery. Law firm Clford Chance says “at least £billion of the cost will be borne by pension funds”.Then Corbyn would roll back trade union legislation. Walkouts over ridiculous pay demands and petty grievances would be commonplace. Public sector pay hikes could lead to soaring inflation.“Boomers” will remember the - Winter of Discontent when million days were lost to strikes.In the s tens of thousands quit Britain to escape industrial unrest and high taxes. Expect another brain drain under Corbyn.A major reason why Britain joined the EEC in  was a desperate attempt to improve its uncompetitive productivity.Under PM Corbyn talks to leave the EU would be in the hands of a Brexit neutral. Think about that logically.Corbyn will ask Europe for a deal which he will then not back in a second referendum. So the EU will offer something as close to Remain as they can possibly get. EUref would be a choice between Remain and Remain-in-all-but-name.And Corbyn believes that would placate million Leavers Corbyn needs Lib Dem and SNP help to take No. That’s why he’s been playing footsie with Nicola Sturgeon over a Scottish vote. Britain cannot be governed by continuous referendums. They will only whip up more ision and rancour.Colonel Tim Collins, remembered for his eve-of-battle speech in Iraq in , warns a Corbyn administration would not be trusted to receive vital intelligence from allies.This would have “signicant and far-reaching” consequences for Britain’s security.Nearly half of British Jews would “seriously consider” exiting should Corbyn win.Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis warned: “A new poison, sanctioned from the very top, has taken root in the party.”Labour is only the second party — after the far-right BNP — to be investigated by human rights watchdog the Equality and Human Rights Commission.Since the last election around another three million have registered to vote. Over two-thirds are under  — an age group that usually backs Labour and who have no memory of the Winter of Discontent.While opinion polls favour the Conservatives, our destiny will again be decided by tiny swings in key constituencies.So beware Friday the th.

Alison and partner Michael Leese complained to the Ombudsman, who ruled in their favour, but the issue has still not been resolved. Alison, , said: “I’m astounded at the ineptitude. It’s surely not that dficult to bill someone for the electricity they are using, the Daily Record reported . “I’ve spent hours on the phone, provided the correct meter number countless times and sent photos of the meter in situ. But it’s still not sorted.” She and Michael, , a personal trainer, moved to the £, three-bed terrace and were told to expect a welcome pack from ScottishPower. Alison, of Croftfoot, near Glasgow, said: “The builder had provided final meter readings and the entire development was taken on by ScottishPower.” But no welcome pack arrived. Alison, a banker, said: “I called to complain and was told it was on its way. I’ve yet to see it.”  She contacted the energy giant again in May last year as she was worried about the mounting bill. Alison said: “I was unaware that the meter registered to the account was the wrong one and I was paying for someone ’s supply. But I’d set up the app on my phone and could see the bill increasing. “All I wanted to do was pay by direct debit. The penny dropped when an adviser at ScottishPower read out the meter number. It was one digit out.” "},{"url":null,"title":"comedian steve coogan calls people","story":"NewsComedian Steve Coogan calls on people to vote tactically to boot out the ToriesHe was out campaigning with a Lib Dem candidate - but he called on people to vote for whichever candidate can beat Boris Johnsons party locallyShareCommentsByJoe Gammie:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video comedian-steve-coogan-calls-people-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics comedian-steve-coogan-calls-people-\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Professor Sir John Curtice, speaking on BBC Radio  Westminster Hour , told Carolyn Quinn: “We are looking at a -point Conservative lead over the Labour Party,  to , Liberal Democrats now down to , the Brexit Party down to  and essentially the story of this election campaign is Tories up  points, Labour up  points, net effect still a Tory lead of , which probably meansit transpires in the ballot boxes, something around - Tory seats and Boris Johnson being able to pursue Brexit.But the Tory lead of  points is not that far ahead of the -point figure, which is the point at which you say there’s a % chance of a hung Parliament. It’s held steady so far and the Tories have managed to retain their position but those last three days could still make a dference.”  Asked about tactical voting, he said: “It’s certainly true that in the - seats scenario, a lot of the crucial seats that the government needs to pick up would be picked up quite narrowly and there is no doubt that one of the reasons for uncertainty for those of us standing outside and concern for central office about what will happen on Thursday is the extent to which voters do vote tactically.I’ve done one exercise in which I’ve simulated, given the current position in the polls, where you then add to that the amount of anti-Conservative tactical voting in line with what happened in the  general election , which is the first time and the one real time we saw anti-Conservative tactical voting on a fairly extensive scale."},{"url":null,"title":"tory candidate darren henry says","story":"NewsTory candidate Darren Henry says people who use food banks struggle to budgetDarren Henry, who is running to be the MP for Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire, made the comments during a hustings event.

But it can cause confusion for my stepfather Derek. Because now when he watches EastEnders, he sometimes gets muddled between fact and fiction.When I’m not there, he’ll watch me on TV and say to my mum, ‘Is Tanya still in the bathroom ’ It seems he thinks I’m in the house, because he’s seen my character Rainie on screen. Derek was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in , aged . He has always been a highly intelligent man who worked as a design engineer and ran his own business. But after he had a mini stroke, we noticed changes in his memory. At first, weaposd think, ‘Well, he’s getting older and more forgetful,’ but it became more obvious that something wasn’t right.When the doctors told us he had dementia, Derek, who is a very practical person and doesn’t easily show emotion, became accepting of it pretty quickly.My mum was more upset – to think of seeing someone you love possibly slip away, knowing what he might go through. We got in touch with the Alzheimer’s Society and learnt more about the condition, and we sat and talked about it a lot as a family. We made a decision to take each day as it comes, that there was no point living unhappily, worrying what the future was going to hold – let’s live in the now, the today. And that has served us really well. We speak openly and practically and philosophically about it, and we face it head-on.Everyone’s experience is dferent, and dementia can develop quickly – with Derek it’s been pretty gradual over the six years.  The most dficult part for him is having to slow down and recognise that he can’t do the same things he used to. He gave up driving because odd things began to happen, like he once swerved to avoid something in the road that wasn’t there, so that loss of independence is tough.And he’s always been very much a do-er, he can’t sit still for very long unless he’s watching sport on the telly. He loves gardening and he’s still pottering around the garden, but when he bought some new plants recently that needed to be potted, he just couldn’t remember how to do it. Sometimes he can’t rememberhe’s brushed his teeth, so he’ll do them twice, and he won’t remember that he’s got to go up the stairs to get to the bathroom. He loves playing the piano, but now he can’t remember that he’s just played something, so he’ll play the same song half a dozen times. One time, he couldn’t even find the piano, and was looking for it on the shelf under the kettle in the kitchen. And of course the piano isn’t even in the kitchen. With the TV remote control, he’ll sometimes look at it and not know how to use it – he’ll start pointing it at the cupboard.We do laugh, because you have to find the funny side – there is humour in le, even in tough times. One night he was going upstairs and I said, ‘Sleep well, Derek,’ and he replied, ‘Well, I will doI can remember where the bed is…’ He does understand the situation, and the raw reality. Another dficult thing is the physical danger. His brain seems to stop tellinghis body to feel pain, so he could have a deep cut and he won’t know he’s bleeding because he doesn’t always feel it.  He sometimes has problems seeing things below knee height, so he’ll fall over coffee tables, or any kind of obstacle – it can be a person sitting on the ground and he just won’t see them.We’ve had to move flower pots or he’ll just wade through them. And in the garden, we have put thick white tape on the steps, so he can see them – his brain can make natural colours, like grey, blend into each other.The edges of plates can be dficult to see for Alzheimer’s sufferers too, and the food will fall off, so we try to use vivid colours to help him out. Luckily, he’s still good at looking after his personal hygiene – so long as he can find the toilet! Recently, in the middle of the night he got up and sat on the bedroom chair thinking it was the loo.My mum was like, ‘No, Derek, quick!’ She’s always sleeping with one eye open, looking out for him all the time. He can’t be left alone.He couldn’t be responsible for doing anything, like cooking, that could cause him harm.Mum is really good at being diplomatic, but she has to stop him hurting himself. It can sound like she’s telling him off, which frustrates him, and it’s dficult because his brain isn’t always working logically now.To give mum some time to herself – the first in six years – he’s started going to a local day care centre. I don’t live close by and my EastEnders filming schedule is erratic, but I try to get there when I can, and she has neighbours who help out too. Dementia can be a very lonely illness for the people living with it and their carers, especially at Christmas, and it’s easy to think you’re the only person who feels like this.But it’s not something to hide away. The more we speak about it, the more people understand and will rally round.We haven’t always spent Christmas together as a family – Mum has always been happy for me to go awayI’ve wanted to – but Derek’s illness has made me want us all to be together for special occasions. Because change is happening, and I want to spend the time with Derek as much as I hope he wants to spend the time with us. While we can still enjoy celebrations together, let’s do it, I want to keep hold of these moments.

You’d be forgiven for not being aware of the previous meetingsas they tend to be inconspicuous. But this time it’s going to be dferent. Thanks to the school strikes, the disruption caused by Extinction Rebellion and the work of Greta Thunberg and Sir David Attenborough, the climate emergency is now high up on the list of public concerns. Meanwhile, the Amazon has been burning, bush fires are raging in Australia and America, and the climate crisis is causing a humanitarian disaster every week. But so far COP has been nothing more than a lot of hot air,you’ll pardon the pun. This year’s meeting needed a last-minute rescue plan before it even started. Costa Rica wanted to host the event but lacked the resources, so Chile took control. Everything was set for Santiago, billed as “the blue COP” because at long last issues about the oceans would take centre stage. But rioting in the capital and a political crisis forced the COP to be moved. The Spanish government – despite being in the throes of a general election – stepped up and offered Madrid, where this year’s talks are now taking place. Almost , delegates and  heads of state have met desperately trying to salvage the global promises which came out of the Paris Agreement four years ago but with very little action.  At the same time, a report delivered some more grim news showing carbon emissions are up .% when they should be down by % a year to deliver on the Agreement. We are going in completely the wrong direction. Ironically, the conference has been sponsored by power giant Endesa, a leading contributor to greenhouse gases and Spain’s largest emitter.

Ryan Rodgers, , and his partner Jenny Grimes, , say they used to receive £, a month in financial support. But the couple - who have seven children all under the age of seven - say the introduction of the benefits cap has decimated their finances and left them reliant on food banks. They say they have been left with no option but to launch an appeal on GoFundMe for help as Christmas approaches. The family receive £. a month once the benefit cap and the cost of renting their home is deducted, reports the Liverpool Echo . But in practice, they say they have to survive on just £ a month, because money is deducted for the advance payment they received when they first moved onto Universal Credit . The advance payment is a loan applicants can get to cover the five-week wait before their first payment, but it has to then be paid off in future weeks. As a result, the nine-strong family from Liverpool, with their children all aged seven and under, to regularly rely on food banks and the generosity of friends and family offers.  But their situation has got so desperate the couple decided to go public about their struggle. They have asked for cash donations from strangers in an online fundraising appeal. On GoFundMe, Mrs Grimes said: We are a young couple with seven children trying to get back on our feet after becoming homeless having to start all over again from fresh. We have been benefit capped to the bare minimum and we are really struggling to get by. Our situation is being much more a struggle with Christmas being only a few weeks away. We feel really ashamed to have to do this as weaposve never had to do anything like this before. I hate to have to do this and itaposs took a lot for me to actually do it, but there is only so much we can do as a family. Any help at all is very much appreciated, evenyou could point me in the direction of getting some help. Thank you.Ryan and Jenny, previously from Kirkby, Merseyside, look after Ellie, seven, six-year-old twins Kenzie and Kelsie, Laysie, four, Archie, two and two twin boys who are only seven months - Tobie and Rylie. They currently live in a three bedroom property in north Liverpool, paying £ for rent. The family was once homeless and had to live in a Premier Inn hotel, paid for by the council. Mr Rodgers, who used to work in restaurants as a waiter, said he had been washing cars to pay for his familyaposs electricity bills. His plight has affected his mental health and he suffers from depression and anxiety, describing how his situation has left him feeling useless. It also led to him becoming an alcoholic, which he has now battled through. A charity called Care UK, based in Warrington, have been invaluable, the dad said, providing the family-of-nine with regular food parcels. Mr Rodgers, who has been with Ms Grimes for seven years, said: With Christmas, thereaposs so much we need but canapost provide for the kids as a family. Itaposs got to the stage where weaposve got to do something about it. Food banks only go so far. Itaposs a real struggle. I have friends without children who get more than us. Just the one baby costs £ a week. I want to get full-time work but I canapost with the kids. We have to speak out, weaposve not go a choice, itaposs no longer how I feel, the children are the priority. We need an opportunity. Itaposs out of order we can just be left to get on with it. Weaposve been set up to fail as parents by the state. Thereaposs nobody to contact about our situation, the Job Centre workers just tell us itaposs not their department.

Just days after the snap was taken, a warrant was issued for Epstein over the sexual assault of a minor. The case ultimately resulted in Epstien being convicted and jailed for soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution. A source told The Sun on Sunday, which has published the Epstein image: “This photograph sums up just why the Epstein affair has been so disastrous for Andrew. He brought these people into the royal fold, to Windsor Castle no less, where they could rub shoulders with the great and good. This picture will raise further questions about Andrewaposs interaction with these iniduals.

Angela McGill, from Glasgow, was tucking into the festive snack when she swallowed what she thought was a bit of pastry. Gulping hard, she realised that sheaposd actually swallowed her partial dentures - two teeth attached to a plastic plate - and started panicking. The caterer went to hospital and an x-ray revealed the plate was stuck half way down her throat. Medics advised any procedure to pull the plate back up her throat would do more harm than good. So Angela had to wait  hours for her dentures to pass through her digestive system - before she flushed them down the loo. Mum-of-three Angela, from Glasgow, is finding the funny side to this right cock-up - but has sworn off mince pies forever. She laughed: I just couldnapost believe Iaposd swallowed my plate - how silly is that ! And I was really enjoying the mince pie too, I just got distracted when someone I work with said my name and I gulped.  It was rough, and really hard - I thought it was a tough piece of pastry!   Then it went down, and got lodged at the back of my throat, and I thought - aposoh my god, Iaposve swallowed my plate, Iaposve literally lost my teeth!apos. Angela had her inch-square partial dentures fitted last month to replace -year-old caps she had fitted as a girl after an accident.  I was swimming when I was about  when this boy jumped in the pool, knocked me, and then I clattered my teeth against the edge of the pool, she said.   Forty years on, the crowns needed replacing obviously, so they fitted me with two front teeth on this plastic plate instead. Unused to her new teeth - which are on her bottom left-side - Angela accidentally swallowed them while eating a mince pie from supermarket Aldi on December .  Angela, a kitchen assistant in healthcare, went to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, where medics advised to let the plate pass through her digestive system.   She is waiting to get a new set fitted - and hopes sheaposll get them in time for Christmas.

The incident happened after an argument involving four pupils from the same school in the Newbridge area of Bath on September , Avon and Somerset police said. The force said three suspects, two girls aged  and one aged , were interviewed, but two of the girls face no further police action due to insufficient evidence. Police referred the matter regarding the third girl to the local Youth Offending team, Somerset Live reports. The girls were pupils at Oldfield School, it has been reported. Members of the victimaposs family said she was taken to hospital after she was knocked out. They also claimed that two -year-olds were suspended and a -year-old was expelled after the attack. Oldfield School said it contacted police about the incident, which happened off site, launched an investigation and then handed out appropriate sanctions against those involved. The victimaposs family raised concerns about video footage of the incident and criticised the school, saying not enough was done to protect her. The girlaposs older brother said he and his sister had seen three videos of the incident at a meeting with a teacher. In the first video, my sister and one girl began the fight stood across from each other, both of them looked like they arenapost really sure what was happening, he said. The other girl grabs my sister by the hair and after a small scuffle, my sister is dragged to the floor and the video ends. In the second video, they are both slightly further away from the original videoaposs location and both upright. After a few exchanged blows, my sister is quite clearly knocked out and slumps to the ground, he claimed. The other girl then looks at the camera laughing and smiling whilst she sits on top of my sister and starts swingingagain. In the final video, my sister is unconscious on the floor and you see a hand come into shot with a spider in its fingertips. This hand then begins to rub over my sisteraposs face and lips to aposcheck she isnapost faking being knocked outapos. Two of the three girls stay out of the way of the camera. He said he thinks the schoolaposs response was not good enough. My sister was followed home and she was toldshe didnapost fight one of the -year-old girls, the -year-old girl was going to beat her senseless, he said. The videos were shown to me at meetings with the school. A teacher spent the entire meeting trying to make my sister admit it was just a fight between students. He also promised my sister would be well away from the girls who attacked her until the issue was resolved. But the day after these meetings my sister was pulled into a room with one of her attackers and told by a teacher to be civil with each other. The school and the police have the videos and so does the girl who recorded them, he claimed. The other two had one-day suspensions and then were back in my sisteraposs class. This is not a good enough response from the school. The videos were on Instagram conversations but the videos didnapost go on social media, they were shown around personally. The victimaposs mother said: I absolutely wasnapost satisfied with any of the phone calls I had with the school. In each one they just tried to make it my daughteraposs fault or nothing they could foresee, she said.  One teacher actually took my daughter into a room with her attacker and requested she acts civil, she claimed. She said that initially she was told her daughteraposs alleged attackers would be kept away from her, but this did not happen. My daughter was utterly let down by the teachers and staff at Oldfield School in every way imaginable and still is. The school should have excluded those girls immediately and protected the victim, not the bullies, she said. The police showed me the videos. Theyare sickening. The videographer should be punished as well as the attackers. The victimaposs sister said she used to be a confident and outgoing girl. They actually put spiders on her face when she was unconscious to check she wasnapost faking. My sister used to be so confident, talkative and outgoing and now she is so subdued. She is so shy and barely says four or five words to me. This has changed her le. I am very concerned about her mental health. This is all so upsetting. Her sister said all three girls should have been expelled. She said: My sister was and still is very scared going to school. The school says it has a zero tolerance policy but their response has not been good enough. We are trying to find these videos and stop people from seeing what happened to our sister. Avon and Somerset police said in a statement: We were made aware of an incident involving a group of female pupils from a school in the Newbridge area of Bath on  September. There was an argument involving four girls, following social media postings. The victim – was reportedly knocked unconscious – in the incident in which three other girlswere involved in the altercation. We subsequently interviewed the three suspects. In the case of two of the girls there is no further action as there is insufficient evidence to progress the matter further to obtain a successful prosecution. In the case of the other suspect, there is insufficient evidence to prosecute, there has been no complaint from the victim and the matter has been referred to the Youth Offending Team for a decision.

The Queensway  area in Caia Park, Wrexham, was recently ranked the th poorest in Wales on a Welsh Government index. The estate, which is home to several families, has faced cuts in services and even the closure of the anti-poverty Communities First scheme in Wrexham, the Daily Post reports. Cllr King, a former Wrexham council leader who runs The Venture playscheme on the estate, said: The most important figures are the child poverty figures released in April which show Caia Park was had the first and second worst areas in Wales. In fact three out of the top four were on the estate. It has been a steady decline, he said. Are you a struggling parent  Email webnews@mirror Children are now coming to The Venture, not to play, but to get something to eat because they are starving. They are suffering from malnutrition and its unbelievable thataposs happening in a first world country and we know that children born into poor families are more likely to have health problems. There are no other housing estates in the UK where this happens, it has the largest concentration of child poverty anywhere. Church army officer Chris Lawton said although St Markaposs Church had suffered vandalism, there is a growing sense of community. However he added children have been hungry and the church has launched a Holiday Hunger scheme to feed young people who do not have access to paid school dinners.  Itaposs very sad, he said. We initially only had one or two families turning up at most to our food bank, now we can have - families. Wrexham and Caia park have had a major problem with car arson in recent years and on Brym Eglwys outside the church, the remains of another burned out vehicle stained the road. Although crime levels are high, local Brian Hyde said he feels safe in the area. That is the first incident I have seen on this road in  years, he said: Everbody knows everybody  here and they look out for each other.  Queensway does have its problems, but over here I do feel safe and it is quite quiet. The Given to Shine charity is now delivering half of its  parcels a week to struggling families on Caia Park. We are seeing mums in hospital, she said. They are living off energy drinks just so their children can eat. It is heartbreaking. We have definitely seen a massive increase since the summer months. The little amount people earn is having to spent on energy bills. Working over at The Venture, community councillor Colin Powell said: Not a lot has changed here in the last  years. It does feel as though the estate has been abandoned by Wrexham council. Wrexham is fairly affluent place but Caia Park is not getting the help it needs.  Cllr King added: There are some positives in Caia Park, there is a community spirit, and there are a lot of hard working people, working ridiculous hours an low wages, in jobs that other people would not do. But it needs a large increase in funding to bring it back to where it was years ago and the council could be doing more and the council needs to do more. Wrexham council said in a statement: The council ran the Communities First operation in Caia Park and Hightown between  and , until the closure of the programme. The council has maintained a Communities for Work team based on the Caia Park Estate and in Plas Madoc since this time and this project, funded by European Social Fund is expected to continue to  with funding of £,, confirmed.  This employability support programme was expanded in  with the addition of the WG’s Communities for Work Plus programme, which increased the number of participants eligible for employability support. As per the Communities for Work programme, Communities for Work Plus is delivered across two operations on the Caia Park Estate and in Plas Madoc, and is worth a total of £,. The Legacy Fund was launched for an initial period of   to  , and the council has used this fund to provide andadditional officer to work in each of the Caia Park and Plas Madoc operations, as well as a training budget and barriers fund to further complement the Communities for Work teams, which totals £,. The project is based out of the Caia Park Partnership offices. Through this combination of employability support, more than  people have been supported into paid employment to date. The council also used the Legacy Fund to create and Employability Support Grant worth £,, which was available to previous providers of Communities First services. Applications for financial support were approved for the two  years of the fund from The Venture Playground Ltd. as lead for the Wrexham Youth  Play Partnershipand the Caia Park Partnership.  The council has supported the Caia Park Partnership to secure Asset Transfer arrangements and physical improvements to its buildings on Prince Charles Road, which has led to the creation of the Hwb element of the Partnership and also the extension of the Sparkles Day Nursery, which received funding through the Vibrant  Viable Places Programme. The council is currently supporting the assignment of the lease at the Red Dragon Public House, and planning permission is being sought for its conversion into a new, modern convenience store and is currently working to support the granting of a lease to Wrexham Youth  Play Partnership for the Gwenfro Valley site.

Were you on the island or do you know anyone who was there  Email webnews@mirror. Police believe less than  people were on the island, which is home to New Zealandaposs most active volcano. At least  people - some of them believed to be tourists from the Ovation of the Seas cruise ship - were rescued. Michael Schade, an engineering manager from San Francisco, was one of the tourists who made it off the island minutes before the eruption. In a video Schade posted on Twitter as he sped away from the  island on a boat, a huge plume of white ash soars into the sky as a group of frightened tourists huddles close to the shore.He said: This is so hard to believe. Our whole tour group were literally standing at the edge of the main crater not  minutes before.  Tourists were seen walking inside the crater just moments before the eruption. A crater rim webcam owned and operated by New Zealand science agency GeoNet shows groups of people walking toward and away from the rim inside the crater, from which white vapour constantly billows.  At pm the crater rim camera catches a group of people - tiny specks in relation to the vast volcano - right at the edge of the rim. At .pm - just a minute before the eruption - the group is headed away from the rim, following a well-worn track across the crater. It is understood that about half of those on the island at the time were from Australia. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters: We know that there were a number of tourists on or around the island at the time, both New Zealanders and visitors from overseas.

Mr Finlay and his we then made their way to the Italian Grill where Mr Finlay was refused service in his intoxicated state.

However, he admits they are delighted to have -goal Shanks nearing contention.“We’re still tracking Lawrence and how he’s getting on. We’ll look at it and review that before tomorrow,” he said.“He’s got a good chance of playing and he’s done well.“There’s been a bit of precaution with him but we’ll see how he gets on towards the end of the week.“You can see what he’s done all season, so it’s great to have him back training.“Credit to the boys we have in the squad because it shows with the last result against Queen of the South and performance as well was fantastic .“Having Lawrence back in there helps with the competition for places and we know what he can do on the pitch.“It’s excellent for us to have that selection choice.”The visit of the Wasps will be United’s first match in three weeks and Forrest says they’re itching to get back out there and build on their seven-point lead at the top of the table.“I think they’re dying to get on the pitch, to be honest,” he added.“It’s one of those situations where you’ve been off so long, you can feel it and see it in training that they just want to play.“Fingers crossed they go out there and do the business.”Forrest also took time to praise United fans after they sold out their home allocation for the Dundee derby on December .“It’s magnicent to hear and I know I keep going back to the fans but the backing we’ve had has been excellent.“For them to sell out so quickly, it’s exciting and it’ll be another fantastic game.“However, we need to push that one to the side and remain focused on the Alloa game.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/medw-tele-sports-podcast-twa-teams-1-846x564.jpg ","title":"unprecedented ticket demand expected to see utd sell out for derby","story":"#Unprecedented ticket demand# has seen Dundee United sell out the Tannadice home end more than three weeks ahead of the upcoming derby.Arabs have swamped the Tangerines ticket office since briefs went on sale yesterday morning.Impressive form has been added to two comprehensive derby victories as United sit seven points clear at the top of the Championship.And that has seen fans flock to see their side with attendances topping , for most home matches of late.The first derby of the season back in August saw a sell-out at Tannadice as United ran out -

went in to the game unbeaten in six games despite continued injury issues, but were aware – with only a one point advantage over fourth-placed Motherwell, who were hosting struggling Hearts and went on to win - # they needed a victory to stay best of the rest behind Celtic and Rangers.Hibs, meanwhile, were sixth after an upturn in results under interim boss Eddie May and new manager Jack Ross.Home striker Christian Doidge started the afternoon with seven goals in five matches.Derek McInnes stuck with the same line-up from the second half of the - home draw with Rangers, a ---, with Zak Vyner and Lewis Ferguson in holding midfield, while Jon Gallagher was in the .Vyner’s fellow defender Greg Leigh was also used in an advanced position once more, joining Andy Considine, who’d recovered from a hip knock, on the left side.Niall McGinn had looked like he’dto the squad after a calf strain, but was replaced on the bench by Bruce Anderson before kick-off as James Wilson stayed on the right of the three behind frontman Sam Cosgrove.Early on, Ash Taylor moved well to block a dangerous Hibs ball into the area, however, Scott McKenna could only clear to Stevie Mallan, with the midfielder forcing a good low save from Joe Lewis.On nine minutes, Sam Cosgrove sprinted on to a loose ball, after a tangle between Gallagher and Ryan Porteous, with his near post drive from  yards tipped round the post by Hibs keeper Ofir Marciano.It took  minutes for the next moment of note to arrive, Marciano making a hash in possession at the edge of his area and Cosgrove robbing him. However, Hibs’ defence got back quickly and the Dons were forced to work the ball wide before Considine flashed a tasty cross along the home side’s six-yard line.Soon after, Gallagher came close to finding Cosgrove  yards out after getting in behind on the right, but Porteous stretched to get a toe on the pass.North-east native Martin Boyle had a drive from  yards deflected wide for Hibs on  minutes as the game settled into middling quality tit-fot-tat.On  minutes Marciano made an impressive double stop from Wilson at the near post – after the former Manchester United man had headed the ball round Paul Hanlon – and then Cosgrove on the rebound from  yards.Before the break, Ferguson – who’d shown increasing frustration with referee Colin Steven’s decisions to award Hibs several fouls in Aberdeen’s half – was booked for a challenge on Scott Allan when the home player was deep in his own half.After the interval, Florian Kamberi quickly hit a close-range shot across goal and over the bar.However, Hibs were ahead on  minutes. Scott Allan picked out the run of Boyle, who’d left Considine behind and subsequently drove away from McKenna, rounded Lewis and tap into the empty net.The opener served to lt the home side, who looked like scoring another.McInnes made a triple change on  minutes – with Ryan Hedges, Curtis Main and Dean Campbell coming on for Wilson, Vyner and Logan, and shting to a --.But Hibs soon scored another.Florian Kamberi played a one-two with Melker Hallberg before playing a killer ball through a big gap in the Dons backline to Boyle.

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"ardfern first responders recognised after saving mans life","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ardfern First Responder group was nominated for the  national Scottish Ambulance Service awards after their rapid action saved a Barbreck man#s le.There were seven other groups on the shortlist and the Ardfern groupThe Scottish Ambulance Servicesaid of the Ardfern group: #The team gives the community a sense of safety and support when an emergency happens in this remote area.#The volunteers of this group display exceptional leadership skills and clinical skills and always ensure a great handover to SAS staff when they arrive.

Thatrsquos because therersquos been a lack of strategic vision. You cannot expect public transport, such as buses, to pay for itself,itrsquos going to be a consistent service.ldquoIn Glasgow, we realised that keeping buses on during the night was vital because although they wouldnrsquot be used often, when people did use them it would be urgent.ldquoNow, Scottish Borders Council, in my view, does not adequately fund public transport.\"They say, and I think theyrsquore absolutely right, that theyrsquore inadequately funded by the Scottish Government.ldquoThe Scottish Government say: lsquoit was a bad boy who done it and he ran away because Westminster didnrsquot give us enough moneyrsquo. Now, thatrsquos an example of where there needs to be a degree of strategic thinking.ldquoOn the question of the train being driven by oil, that, as I understand it, was because it was going to be far too expensive to electry it.ldquoThey could only get diesel-driven stock, so it was that or nothing. Now thatrsquos not acceptable. Itrsquos also not acceptable, in my view, that the rails the Borders line runs on were actually made in China.ldquoThat didnrsquot create pollution here in Scotland, but it did across the world and the jobs werenrsquot created here they were created in China.Conservative candidate John Lamont said: ldquoSome parts of the Borders are very well connected but a lot are not,you speak to residents in Newcastleton or Paxton, they do not have a regular bus service to allow them to get around, so itrsquos wrong to say that buses and public transport are accessible.ldquoWersquore very lucky to have Borders Buses here, I have their exceptionally good app, I donrsquot knowmany of you use it but itrsquos a very simple way to get around and very easily find out where your bus is.ldquoI do use it, because itrsquos a good way to get around and itrsquos better for the environment.ldquoBut you canrsquot say that just because I can use it to get from Berwick Station to my house in Coldstream, that other people have access to public transport services, you canrsquot, because thatrsquos simply not true.On buses, Liberal Democrat candidate Jenny Marr said: ldquoBorders Buses is great, and the routes that have started this week with space for the bikes I think as really important.ldquoTo follow on from what John was saying, at Eyemouth College, they have a high rate of dropout In January and February because of how few buses there are and how dficult it is in the winter.ldquoI think we need to look at the successes in some parts of the region and then try and apply that to other places.ldquoI think with Newcastleton, one of the guys from the Campaign for Borders Rail was telling me thata kid wants to get out of the village on a Saturday they will struggle to get back after one or two in the afternoon, and I think we need to make sure that our public transport infrastructure is not a barrier to progress and not a barrier to children and younger people having the le they deserve to have.Finally, SNP candidate Calum Kerr added: ldquoIn relation to the points made on the railway, obviously there is a move around electrication and talk about hydrogen as well, the Scottish Government has set the target that the railways will be net-zero by , as it stands today.ldquoIn terms of public transport and buses, certainly when I met with bus companies previously, therersquos only two bus routes in the Borders which makes a profit, the X and the X.ldquoPeople just donrsquot use it, so it becomes self perpetuating, because then routes get cut, so people have to use their cars, soa green new deal means fundamentally resetting aspects of the economy, and included in that needs to be transport, then you have to invest:you build it they will come.ldquoYou canrsquot just hope people will start using it, and then yoursquoll find a way to make the routes work, it does require signicant investment.ldquoThere is a pound.m green bus fund, so itrsquos about adding green buses continually.

tricks of the trade.Its December now and, as most of the country are battening down the hatches, we keen photographers are getting their thermies ready for sorties outside to shoot winter scenes.The first pieces of kit before you even think about cameras are proper winter outdoor clothing. Plenty of layers, with a good waterproof top layer. Good thermal socks too as you may find yourself standing around for ages on the spot waiting for suitable light to shoot a scene.If you are comfortable then yoursquoll be thinking about photography and not about getting home to a warm fire. Thatrsquos protection for you, but you have to think about your equipment too.Top-end cameras have good weather sealing these days but it may not be  per cent effective, so get a rain cover for your camera bag and a cover for your camera. You can easily make a camera cover from plastic bags and rubber bands, and yoursquore recycling into the bargain.Another thing to think about is batteries, take at least one spare with you and keep it your pocket, not the camera bag. When itrsquos really cold the batteries donrsquot last very long at all so keeping them a bit warmer than ambient maintains their charge until you need it.Snow scenes make great subjects to photograph, and extremely popular. They are one of my favourite genres, running a close second to pictures of the night sky.There is a big problem with snow scenes however and that is SNOW. In a lot of hurriedly taken snow scenes, the snow will appear blue or grey. Thats not the cameras fault, its exposure meter doing what it was designed to do and try and get a compromise exposure to fit the whole frame. However, the camera tries to base everything on what we call an  per cent grey and averages the exposure to suit. Snow is very reflective, particularly in sunlight, and fools the camera meter into under-exposing the scene hence everything will appear dull and not like the lovely glistening snow you were looking at.This is where the photographer has to intervene. We deliberately over-expose what the camera meter is telling us by at least one stop, probably two. It ies a little between cameras and personal preference. I like to over-expose by one and a half stops. Stop! Whatrsquos a stop  A stop is the doubling or halving of the amount of light reaching your sensor . For example,the camera meter says expose for  th of a second, one stop over-exposed would be  th of a second and two stops over would be  th of a second. Using this method you compensate for the light meter wanting to under-expose.On your camera, you can achieve this by either using full manual control of your exposure or using an exposure compensation setting, which many cameras have. Et voila, nice white snow every time. Be careful you donrsquot drop the shutter speed too low though, or you wont get sharp shots handheld, even with image stabilisation . I try to avoid going below  th handheld, faster than that sometimes, depending on how much coffee Ive had.Irsquom not going to be popular for saying this but I hope we get Beast from the East . I had a couple of the best days out with a camera Irsquove had in years during and after that storm.Herersquos a couple of shots I took before sunrise two days before The Beast struck proper. The sunrise one is two exposures blended, one for the sky and one for the snow. If Irsquod just exposed to get the snow right Irsquod have blown out the sky. If Irsquod exposed for the sky the snow would have been dark grey. Sometimes you have to resort to a few tricks.Photo of the month this time is Festival Salute by our syllabus secretary Alistair Peacock. It is a multi-award-winning image this one, and one my favourites. Taken in Edinburgh around Tattoo time, Alistair asked this US soldierhe could take a photo of him.

Jodie Millar as Madame Fi was yet again a sensation.From wild wigs and fervently festive costumes to hilariously adapted versions of Ghostbusters and Chansom Damour, Millar made the stage his own.And he was ably supported by Billy Rooney as Fis son, Jacques.Having tumbled straight from the set of childrens show Rainbow, Rooney has a natural ability for slapstick.Rachel Falconer provided the good side of panto from the sidelines as the fairy Flora, while hitting back with her own couplets was Amy Welsh as the sinister Belladonna.,params: .pushWelsh, with her scarlet dress and green-lighting, was remarkably good as the villain.All good shows, though, rely on the music and Calders song choice was spot-on.From the Boo Radleys and Abba to Elton John and Queen, Beauty and the Beast was a foot-tapping, sing-alonging great night out.While the hits rolled, traditional favourites werent forgotten.The wonderful cast of children were delightful with their environmentally aware Country Gardens and Ugly Bugs Ball, and they made sure Coulter wasnt forgotten with a lovely version of Ally Bally Bee.Stuart Mitchell and Julie Smith should take an additional bow for the choreography.And the dancers and chorus were in fine form throughout the show with every big number being turned into a visual treat.As has become the custom with the Right Angle Theatre Companys annual panto, the loudest cheers of the night were saved for the Braw Lad and Lass as well as Santa Claus.While the mood wasnt always merry, Beauty and the Beast provided the opportunity for this talented company to showcase what they can do -

But he would close his eyes and be strong.It was the one thing in his le where he felt he had not let people down.So he would summon all his strength and draw on who he used to be for those last vestiges of self-belief and refuse the offer of help from his destructive friend.He made it and arrived at the door of the managerrsquos office, clean, sober and ready to work.The manager had no idea John was the same man he passed on a daily basis on the street outside.Admittedly, he did look dferent now, butthe manager had ever paused to look at John or speak to him, then he would surely recognise him. But for once he was glad of his invisibility. If the manager had ever recognised him outside then John would probably lose his job.ldquoYour costume is in the back room. You start in  minutes, said the manager.ldquoThe paperwork came through last week so yoursquore set to go.John knew the routine and got changed.When he sat in his chair, he was transformed. He was Santa.For the next five weeks, he knew he was going to be noticed and even loved. People would speak to him in a kind and almost reverent way, ask him how he was. His beard and red suit wiped away his sense of worthlessness.All that day, families came and he spoke to more people in that one day being Santa than he did the rest of the year being himself.Afterwards, he headed back to the hostel with money in his pocket.His old friend whispered in his ear: ldquoSpend it on me, spend it on me.ldquoMaybe later, but not now, John replied in his head.But the hostel was full and he couldnrsquot find any other place.And so he knew hersquod have to spend a bitter night on the streets.The food van would arrive soon, so he decided to wait for it in the busy centre.As he sat, a young girl came up to him.She just stood and stared. John recognised her.She had been one of the children in his grotto earlier and suddenly a fear gripped him: she might recognise who he really was.ldquoCome away from there, shouted her mother.But the girl still stood, staring at John. Then she smiled. John smiled back.Her father came up and took her by the hand, pulling her away without looking at John.He recognised the father as well.He had been so nice and friendly in the grotto, while his daughter stood with him for a photo.But without his white beard and red suit, John was invisible again.ldquoSpend it on me, spend on me, whispered his old friend again, as John had flashbacks of Afghanistan.ldquoSpend it on me and I will keep you company, nobody  cares, pleaded his friend.Then the girl was in front of him again, smiling.ldquoThis is for you, Merry Christmas when it comes.Her father stood by her, holding her hand, but still not looking at John.It was chocolate. The same chocolate bar shersquod chosen with glee in the grotto.ldquoThank you, said John and the girl left with her dad.Johnrsquos old friend was now silent. The food van arrived and he packed the chocolate under his jacket. It was more than chocolate.Now he had to get through the freezing night.Tomorrow, hersquod be loved again."},{"url":null,"title":"celebrating-pls-home-50-years","story":"The building was opened on November , , by John P Mackintosh MP after the old one burned down in .Former and present staff, pupils and friends came together to celebrate the anniversary of the building with a coffee morning and a chance to tour the school.Headteacher Gavin Clark said: ldquoOur th anniversary celebration was a great opportunity for past and present pupils, staff and friends of Preston Lodge to come together and reflect on our schoolrsquos place in the community.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

And so it might yet prove with another of Fukuyamas pronouncements. It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless. It can be seen as early as the school playground that our preferred weaponry is verbal attack and the ability to work stealthily, in ways of which Machiavelli would approve, to undermine the enemy.Irsquove never believed we are nicer than men ndash my experience has been quite the opposite. Yet in the West at least, attitudes in government and society are changing. Itrsquos now possible to be feminine and command respect. Gender no longer signals deficiency. Increasingly, even, it could be seen as a positive advantage.Growing numbers of women are rising through the democratic ranks on the strength of their strategic and negotiating skills, rather than their gung-ho, macho credentials. As a new generation is attracted to these roles, seeing that they no longer need to act tough in order to succeed, then things might just improve. Perhaps it is a reasonable assumption after all that, with more female hands at the tiller, nations will become stronger and safer."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-saw-poverty-shocked-core-glasgow-1970s-worse","story":"My worst fear is a Tory majority which will almost certainly herald a No Deal BrexitJohnson sticks to his no extension pledge when even he is unable to magic the withdrawal agreement into a trade deal within his timescale.My best hope, a hung Parliament, there to nip his ankles and stymie in part the madness that is bound to unfold.Like many of you Brexit has become a background to daily le, as has did the run up to the election.

Grouse moors act as huge carbon stores and pro-active management practices help support active peat bogs rich in wildle.More than  per cent of Scotland is covered in peatland, areas of moor that could hold the key to halting climate change due to their unmatched abilityto lock greenhouse gases deep within the soil.The carbon-storing properties of healthy and well-managed peatlands are renowned, as well as being important wildle habitat, being home to rare birds, mammals and plant species.Peat marshes also help improve water quality and play a vital part in reducing flood risk.Estates across the Tomatin, Speyside, Grampian, Loch Ness and Southern Upland areas have been leading the charge to repair degraded peatlands to enhance their carbon storage capacity.Estates undertaking peatland restoration projects include The Hopes Estate in the Lammermuir Hills, Alvie and Pitmain on Speyside. There has also been extensive peatland restoration completed on Garrogie and Corriegarth estates near Inverness.Projects have also taken place on Farr and Glenmazeran in the Monadhliath Mountains. Estates that are part of the Grampian Moorland Group that have undertaken peatland restoration projects include Invercauld and Candacraig, as well as Mar Lodge and Glenfeshie in the Cairngorms.Spanning , hectares, most of which is open hill and moorland, The Hopes has been heavily involved in intensive peatland restoration activity, working with the Scottish Government through the Scottish Natural HeritagePeatland Action Fund.The project was to restore the peatland on two previously unmanaged sites, covering an estimated  hectares.This has enabled the regeneration of large areas of blanket bog, rich in the main peat-forming species, sphagnum moss.This peatland restoration will ultimately allow for higher levels of carbon capture. Robbie Douglas Miller, owner of The Hopes, said: ldquoWe wholeheartedly support the Precious Places campaign, as moors play a crucial role in all our lives by providing multiple benefits for people and nature. When healthy, they lock in carbon to help combat climate-change, support bioersity and safeguard rural jobs.ldquoI see estate owners, managers and gamekeepers as custodians of that space. We are committed to carrying out vital conservation work across Scotlandrsquos moorlands by implementing climate change measures to help preserve important moorland habitats and save our beautul Scottish landscape for generations to come ndash this will only be achieved by pro-active management.Lianne MacLennan, coordinator of the Grampian Moorland Group, said: ldquoScotlandrsquos grouse moors are special and precious. Degraded peatland was mapped in the Cairngorms National Park and two sites at Invercauld were estimated to be emitting a total of , tons of carbon dioxide equivalent a year.ldquoOnce the peatland restoration work is complete it will make a huge contribution to the overall level of carbon capture across Scotlandrsquos grouse moors.Out of Scotlandrsquos . million hectares of peatland about , hectares show evidence of erosion.The restoration of , hectares of degraded peatland areas by  is one of the objectives of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Climate Change Plan is hoping to achieve.Dee Ward, owner of Rottal Estate in Angus, has completed a tree planting project and is due to undertake a major peatland restoration project in spring .He said: ldquoWe have planted over  acres here at Rottal Estate, totalling , trees, mainly native broadleaves and Scots pine.

To the Conservative Partys dismay, the TV regulator, Ofcom, sided with the block of ice.Elsewhere on the dial, the BBC has been the target of unprecedented criticism for alleged bias in favour of the Conservatives. Two editing errors, one of which removed laughter from a clip of Boris Johnson in an earlier debate, became the justication for a social media tirade against the corporation. The clips have been watched and shared many times more than any of the TV debates.The BBCs political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, has been widely portrayed, unfairly, as a Government spokeswoman. Contrariwise, Andrew Neil, who used to be attacked for having right-wing views, became an unlikely Twitter hero when his piece to camera condemning Boris Johnsons non-appearance on his show went viral. The block of ice, it seems, was otherwise engaged.Social media had been encroaching on the conventional press and media in the last two elections this time it came close to eclipsing them altogether. Analysis by Research Reality suggests that people are increasingly consuming political news through fragmented and partisan clips on their mobile phones, rather than from watching TV debates or reading articles. Politics has merged with entertainment. Comedians are now as influential as journalists or even politicians in shaping attitudes.Young people derive their political information almost exclusively from the internet, with its preoccupations about race and gender identity. Labour, with its media-savvy Momentum shock-troops, has dominated the new medium, churning out memes, jokes and provocative videos. If this were an election for the under-s, Jeremy Corbyn would already be measuring the curtains in Number . Hes called ldquothe absolute boy.Boris Johnson is portrayed as a Bullingdon blowhard, a racist, misogynist and, above all, a liar. Each speech and interview is tracked by a flotilla of ldquofact check posts of ying quality demonstrating that his pants are on fire. These are amplied by comedians and commentators condemning the Tories for being in the pockets of billionaires, letting children starve and for harbouring Jacob Rees-Mogg. The Eton-educated Leader of the House has been kept well away from microphones since his suggestion that people consumed in the Grenfell Tower blaze lacked common sense.Labour has had its own image problems, of course, not least the charge of anti-Semitism that simply wont go away. Last week an extraordinary dossier of allegations from  Labour current party staff, compiled for the forthcoming Equalities Commission investigation into anti-Semitism, was leaked at a crucial moment in Labourrsquos campaign. The leaders of all the major UK religious faiths had earlier condemned Jeremy Corbyn for failing to stamp out hatred towards Jews in Labour ranks. A succession of Labour candidates have been dumped for trading in anti-Semitic imagery and tropes.Mind you, a number of Tory and SNP candidates have also been dropped over anti-Semitism. One of the SNP casualties, Neale Hanvey, in the key target seat of Kirkcaldy, has not gone quietly. He enlisted the support of many in the Yes movement, including the outspoken nationalist blogger Wings Over Scotland, aka Stuart Campbell, who has urged supporters to vote for Hanvey on Thursday.Then, in a bizarre twist, the SNPs conduct investigator on the Hanvey case, Denise Findlay, also resigned. Someone revealed that she too had tweeted last year that: ldquoIt is not anti-Semitic to call Israel a Nazi state. Many of Campbellrsquos readers believe these candidates have been casualties of a growing factional ision in SNP ranks, mainly fought on social media, between transgender activists and members, like Hanvey and Findlay, who oppose self-ID.This winnowing of candidates would have been unimaginable in previous elections. It demonstrates again how social media has become a parallel battleground even at constituency level. Candidates social media accounts are ransacked for dodgy remarks. Twitter has taken on the character of a McCarthyite inquisition.The Big Issues, like taxation and spending, have taken a back seat. Labour evidently decided that it was no longer necessary in the social media age to be cautious about spending pledges. In for a penny in for a billion. The Labour manesto is bold and radical, and has been compared to the  Labour manesto of Clement Attlee. It also involves the biggest peacetime increase in Government spending.Labour is planning to spend and invest a grand total of pound billion over five years, to be financed, improbably, by a % tax on those earning over pound, . And this is only for its declared spending. The Labour manesto ldquoGrey Book did not include the cost of a four-day week, freezing the pension age or nationalising a raft of industries like energy and rail.It is easy to pick holes in the Labour programme, not least in the uncosted poundbn that Labour belatedly offered to the so-called Waspi women, who feel they lost out when the pension age for women was equalised with that of men. The Institute for Fiscal Studies was scathing about the Labour programme in general and that in particular.However, the influential IFS was scathing about all the parties programmes. It said the Tories promise of no increase in income tax, VAT or National Insurance is unsustainable. It also criticised the SNPs proposals, adding that independence would lead to greater austerity than under the Conservatives. This blanket condemnation of the respective parties numbers meant that the spending issue was largely neutralised as the campaign progressed. In the social media scrum, fiscal issues have hardly registered.Focus groups suggest that most voters do not believe Labours promises are credible, however. There has been an air of desperation about Corbyn offering free broadband, cheap rail tickets, lower rents, free childcare, free elderly care, cheaper fuel etc. Labour claimed this week that families will gain pound, a yearthey win the election. Its a shameless exercise in retail politics, but that doesnt mean it isnt effective.The Conservative manesto, by contrast, offers thin gruel. It does include increases in spending but only around poundbn a year, mainly on health, police and gigabit broadband. But the increases mostly restore the cuts made by the Tories in these areas since . The proposal for  new hospitals looks provisional at best and the promise of , nurses includes ,  already employed by the NHS.If you want free stuff, and are prepared to suspend disbelief, Labour certainly sounds attractive ndashyou live in England, that is. Most of the headline measures like free personal care, free tuition fees, free childcare and higher health spending, are already in place in Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon said, with some justication, that Labours manesto was a ldquocut and paste job of the SNPs record in office.However, not even the SNP has proposed borrowing on the scale Labour envisage. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, wants to spend poundbn alone on retooling the economy to meet the challenge of climate change. Electrication of transport, planting two billion trees, investing in green industries. There has been a greater tolerance of government borrowing in this campaign, largely because the Conservatives have stopped using their old language of austerity: of ldquospending what we can afford.Both main parties are saying, in effect, that now is the time to invest because the cost of borrowing has signicantly reduced. Indeed, with near-zero interest rates, money is almost free right now. The UK deficit is only .% of GDP. However, the absolute debt pile is higher than ever.It has already increased from pound trillion to pound. trillion since the Conservatives came to office. This debt will eventually have to be repaid, andthere is an increase in interest rates ndash historically averaging % ndash then there could be a huge bill for millennials to pay. This on top of their present burden of tuition debt , high housing costs, insecure work and low pay.The generational ide has never been more apparent than in this general election. ldquoOK Boomer and ldquogammon have become widely-used terms of abuse on social media, directed at those born in the decades after the Second World War. The over-s are, of course, the generation that overwhelmingly voted for Brexit.This was supposed to be a Brexit election, but Europe has for much of the campaign been crowded out by other relatively trivial issues. In the final days it will no doubt , with the Tories repeating their mantra of ldquoget Brexit done beyond pain threshold. Jeremy Corbyn will be defending his much-criticised pretence that he has no view on the most important issue facing the country in  years.The Liberal Democrats, whove had a disastrous election, will be trying to remind us of their existence. Their leader, Jo Swinson, has been called a marmite politician ndashno-one liked marmite.

They have an enthusiastic base, part of which is much more enthusiastic than they perceive the leadership to be.\"If the leadership downplayed independence they would have a lot of people asking them What the hell  effectively.\"The SNP tends to do best when voters think there isnt going to be a majority, so they think that a lot of SNP MPs could really make a dference for Scotland. Realistically when you look at what voters believe this election is going to be, most of them think it will be a majority Tory Government which will do what it wants.\"As a result of that perception, the SNP doesnt really have that angle to go at, so it kind of had to campaign for independence.\"As to what effect its had, firstly it is only one poll.

The opposition wants to talk about other issues like health and education, but strictly speaking that isnt up for grabs in this election.\"Its a way of having a go at the SNP.\"The SNP doesnt want to feel vulnerable on their domestic record, it doesnt really want to talk so much about domestic performance.\"Annie Wells, the Conservative MSP, yesterday criticised the Nationalists on their performance in devolved issues including health and education, while Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader also hit out at health inequalities under the SNP.Wells said: \"People are sick of referendums, whether itrsquos independence or Brexit.ldquoBoth these need to be put to bed so Scotland can move on, and the Scottish Conservatives seem to be the only ones wanting to do that.ldquoPeople are clearly getting sick of Nicola Sturgeonrsquos endless lecturing on the break-up of the UK.

Labour provide a radical alternative to the status quo and will bring about real change for Scotland and Britain.ldquo Labour will provide poundbn in additional investment for Scotland over two terms, eclipsing the SNPrsquos case for the construction of a separate Scottish state, and place the people of Scotland in the driving seat of the economy.\"Scottish Liberal Democrats leader Willie Rennie, meanwhile, said the decline in the support for independence was partly down to Brexit fatigue.He said: \"Support for independence is down for a multitude of reasons including the realisation that independence would be just like Brexit.\"People are exhausted with all the constitutional chaos of Brexit and independence we have endured for years and want to focus on matters that improve peoplersquos lives like mental health, childcare and the climate.\"People certainly donrsquot want another isive independence referendum within months as the SNP want.

And when it comes to such protests the French are not known for doing things by halves.In all an estimated , people over the past few days have taken part in demonstrations around the country, , of them in the capital Paris, according to a union organiser.: David Pratt on Frances desert warThe Efel Tower and other businesses in the city closed down and security authorities formed a barricade around the presidential palace. Authorities also deployed over , police officers to control protests and marches.Across the country schools were shut, flights cancelled and transport systems disrupted, and this may only just be the start.The fresh round of social unrest is once again calling into question Macronrsquos top down government style, which was a major factor in last yearrsquos protest over poor wages and dwindling living standards.The current strike pits Macron, a -year-old former investment banker who came to power in  on a promise to open up Francersquos highly regulated economy, against a trade union movement that say he is set on dismantling workersrsquo rights and protections.ldquoNo one can fail to see the clouds of social grievance that have gathered over France, observed Alexis Moreau a journalist and French labour movement researcher, writing about the crisis in the political magazine Tribune a few days agoldquoBrought to power by an electoral bloc mostly consisting of top managers, company bosses, and well-off pensioners, Emmanuel Macron has pursued a neoliberal agenda that has deepened the ides in French society, Moreau added.Many French citizens agree and sympathy for the strike has been fuelled by frustration over Macronrsquos wider economic record. Critics of the president for example point to the fact that while he continues to chip away at the welfare state and slashes unemployment benefits, Francersquos rich get off lightly.This after all they argue is a country with more than  billionaires and where French companies last year paid out more idends to shareholders than anywhere  in continental EuropeFor his part Macron, following what some say was a political victory in neutering last years protests, promised to adopt a more inclusive approach. He would listen to other voices he said and take stock of their grievances, but evidence of that to date say detractors remains scant.ldquoThe victory doesnrsquot seem to have rehabilitated Macron. This weekrsquos protest is the reflection of a crisis in French society, one that can explode at any moment, said Jean Garrigues, a political historian at the University of Orleans, speaking to the New York Times. ldquoTherersquos real anxiety over the future, Garrigues warned.At the core of the current unease causing unrest across France is what Macron refers to as his ldquoBig Bang overhaul of the countryrsquos near sacred pension scheme, which comprises more than  dferent plans, many with dferent retirement ages and benefits.In theory, everyone in France retires at . In reality however the average real retirement age is , but that number masks a host of disparities. The average age for men is just over , but some people mostly, women with fragmented careers, have to work until they are .But some pension schemes, especially for certain state employees, de-facto subsidised by other workers, are exceptionally generous. Train drivers, mariners and Paris Opera House ballet dancers for instance are able to retire at the age of , up to a decade earlier than the average worker.At the moment French retirees receive average state pensions of  per cent of their final earnings according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development . This is less than Italybut far more than Germanyand the UK .Given such complexities in France however, past attempts at pension reforms have ended badly. Former president Jacques Chiracrsquos conservative government in  caved into union demands after weeks of crippling protests and lost a parliamentary election  months later.: France strikes: roads blocks and railways shutThe question now is whether Macron can weather the current political storm or will he suffer the same fate as Chirac Underlining how serious the crisis is for the president, the French daily Le Monde on Thursday called it ldquothe moment of truth for Macron.Not pulling any punches, the newspaper insisted that the next few days ldquoare a decisive test for the head of state.According to Macron the existing pension system is unfair and too costly. He wants a single, points-based system under which for each euro contributed, every pensioner has equal rights, or so the thinking goes. The accumulation of these points throughout a personrsquos working le would then be translated into a monthly salary at the point they retired.Supporters of Macronrsquos reforms say the points-based pensions system has a number of advantages. First, it gives iniduals a great deal of autonomy. They can choosethey want to retire at  or . Second, it offers obvious incentives. Someone who retires at  will get a better pension than someone on the same salary that decides to stop working aged .The schemes simplicity, equality of treatment and, above all, transferability say these supporters makes it an attractive proposition, but others are far less convinced.According to French labour movement researcher Alexis Moreau, currently pension levels for those in the private sector are set on the basis of a workerrsquos twenty-five best years or in the case of state employees the last six months of their career. But under Macronrsquos reform proposals their salary would now instead be calculated on the basis of their entire active period.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be a rocket scientist to work out that most wage earners would lose out from this, starting with those whose working lives were hit by periods of unemployment, says Moreau.Around France she says, ldquoworking people have been getting out their calculators to work out how much theyrsquore set to lose.Other observers agree that there are serious built in discrepancies. Veteran journalist John Lichfield who was Paris correspondent for the Independent for  years, says there will inevitably be many losers as well as gainers from the Macron scheme.ldquoNurses for example, have already pointed out that their pension regime has a  billion euro surplus, while the lawyersrsquo fund is  billion euros in the black, wrote Lichfield in the online current affairs magazine Politico.ldquoOther funds, such as those forworkers, are chronically loss making. Teachers, poorly paid early in the careers, say that they would lose outtheir pensions were decided by letime ldquopoints rather than ldquofinal salary, Lichfield added.Some critics also point to flaws in the execution of Macronrsquos reforms, suggesting he has left it too late in his presidential term to undertake such substantial changes.Itrsquos a narrow window of opportunity they say to push through such reforms, after which leaders like Macron no longer have enough political capital to expend on changes that risk losing public support.This certainly appears to be the case right now in France where the political storm clouds continue to gather menacingly over the Elysee Palace.Yet the unpopularity in some quarters with Macronrsquos pension reforms sits in sharp contrast with some opinion poll ratings which are said to have climbed to the high s and low s, unusually high for a French mid-term president.But as the crisis rumbles on, Macrons pension tsar Jean-Paul Delevoye is due to hold talks with the unions on Monday before the Prime Minister Edouard Philippe presents the broad outlines of the proposal to the public mid-week.:Emmanuel Macron stands his ground, saying Nato suffering from brain death and needs clearer strategyLast Friday however French union leaders said public workers in opposition to the reforms should maintain their industrial action until Tuesday, when they urged members to again flood the streets.ldquoUnions will meet on Tuesday evening to decide on our next actionsby then Macron and Philippe have not reversed course and opened negotiations, Catherine Perret of the left wing CGT union told reporters.The current strikes are being seen as a test of strength for the French trade union movement, which has been more defensive since the  economic crisis. For those hard-left unions whose membership and influence have diminished in recent years, the crisis poses a delicate tightrope walk of needing to pressure Macron and the government while not creating a public backlash.In Paris last Thursday, gilets jaunes protesters who posed a signicant challenge to Macronrsquos agenda with anti-government demonstrations last year joined union marchers. But Thursdayrsquos march was also much larger than any yellow vest protest, underlining the threat level and unease among wider sections of French workers and society.ldquoThe government is truly afraid of the scale of the mobilisation, Bertrand Hammache, a CGT union official at the RATPwas quoted as saying last Thursday.ldquoIt has begun bilateral meetings with each union to try and reassure us over what the reform means, and give us a reason to give up on the strike. But thatrsquos out of the question, Hammache insisted.But not all unions agree. Francersquos biggest and most moderate trade union federation, the CFDT for example, broadly supports Macronrsquos reforms, while some unions have failed to agree on a common front against them.By far the biggest fear for the moment though is the potential for violent protests stirred up by members of groups from the hard right and left of the political spectrum. In central Paris last Thursday police used tear gas when hooded protesters on the fringes of the trade unionsrsquo march threw fireworks at officers, ransacked bus stops, and set fire to rubbish bins.\" alt\"HeraldScotland: French economy minister Emmanuel Macron appears on The Andrew Marr Show \" class\"editor-image\"French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner has warned that thousands of anarchist ldquoblack bloc and hardcore ldquoyellow vest protesters, who last year took to the streets for months over the cost of living and perceived elitism of the political class, might try to wreak havoc.Some observers however have also expressed concern that far from being confined to Macron and France itself, the crisis poses a much wider danger. Writing in her column inlast week French journalist Natalie Nougayrede suggested that extreme forces across Europe are busily ldquorejoicing over Macronrsquos gilets jaunes predicament.According to Nougayredersquos assessment, ldquofrom Britainrsquos hardline Brexiteers to Italyrsquos far right strongman Matteoi Salvini, not to mention Putinrsquos propaganda outlets, the relish is unmistakable.Certainly there is little doubt that Macronrsquos championing of liberals and pro-Europeans has not gone down well with some of those leaders he has criticised for targeting migrants and political opponents.Perhaps sensing Macronrsquos vulnerability at this precise moment, some have been quick to exploit his dficulties at home in France. On a similar tack, there are pressing questions too as to how much the current strike could damage Macronrsquos wider international standing.Itrsquos worth remembering that just as things were brewing up at home, other leaders put Macron on the spot last week during the NATO Summit in London, where he clashed with US President Donald Trump during a tense press conference.But without doubt itrsquos on his home turf that Macron faces his toughest battle for now. Should he not blink over his controversial pension policy, then doubtless the gas masks and barricades will again be the norm on the streets of Paris this week.Back in  while serving as Prime Minster of France, Edgar Faure once wryly observed that, ldquoFrance is always early to revolt, because it is always late to reform.Pension reform is never an easy political sell, not least in France and might yet well prove a make or break moment for Macron on many levels.

While Scotland it made Scotlands limit the lowest in the UK, many European countries had lower limits still.Prior to the change there were warnings that many on-trade licensed premises would close, and the Scottish Licensed Trade Association has since claimed businesses have lost up to  per cent of their takings, costing Scottish pubs millions of pounds a year.But in the first study of its kind, experts at the University of Stirling interviewed owners and managers of on-trade premises ndash such as pubs, restaurants and nightclubs ndash to understand how the legislation had affected their businesses.The team found that while proprietors said the ban had led to fewer people drinking after work and more leaving premises earlier on weekdays, most reported no long-term financial impact on their business.Some had made adaptations in anticipation of the law change, including building in other sources of revenue, by improving the range of food on offer and expanding provision of non-alcohol and low alcohol drinks.Dr Niamh Fitzgerald, an Associate Professor in the Institute of Social Marketing at Stirling, led the study.

The findings of our study ought to provide policymakers with some reassurance that the on-trade alcohol retail sector may be able to successfully adapt business practices and products offered in the context of a reduced drink-drive limit.Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said the study countered alarmist predictions from the industry.She said: \"This report demonstrates that alarmist predictions that lowering the drink-driving limit would be disastrous for the pub trade were unfounded. Reducing the drink drive limit was the right thing to do and it is encouraging to see support for the lower limit and that more people appear to be choosing not to drinkthey are driving.However the industry has criticised the scope of the new study. Paul Waterson, of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association said it was preposterous.\"We carry out two anonymous surveys a year and regularly get  premises replying.

What it said was % want to stay in the UK and % donrsquot, which is pretty much the same as the result in . There have been changes since then obviously ndash and the YouGov poll is one of the biggestndash but support for independence hasnrsquot collapsed. Far from it. The main lesson of the polls is that most of the support for Yes, and No, is ingrained at around the mid to high s.Which leaves the bit in the middle: the voters who appear to have been shting to Yes but may now be shting to No before changing back to Yes again, who knows. Therersquos no exact political science here, but I think the results in , as well as some of the voters Irsquove spoken to, and the YouGov poll, provide some clues. On the whole, these voters in the middle are progressive, Left-leaning and inclined towards Laboursome went over to Yes in  and never went back others, the nouveau nationalists, are more volatile. Itrsquos this group that will probably decide how it all pans out in the end.:Nicola Sturgeon suggests EU vote would take place before indyrefAs for trying to establish exactly who the nouveau nationalists are, the result of the independence referendum is important. At either end of the scale in , you had those who vote Conservative and those who vote SNP % of the Conservatives voted No and % of the SNP supporters voted Yes. But look at the figures for Labour ndash they were much more evenly ided at % for No and % for Yes Labour voters, or at least voters on the left, are much more likely to be switherers, or sympathetic to Yes, or undecided.Irsquove seen this for myself when Irsquove spoken to people campaigning on the ground for Yes. I particularly remember one woman I met: a lady from Ayrshire in her s called Marie, who switched to Yes and the SNP after a letime of voting Labour. Marie had always taken the view that socialism was an international movement and you should care just as much about the poor in Gateshead as you do for the poor in Glasgow and therefore vote No to independence.But then she remembered two things. She remembered Margaret Thatcher condemning Nelson Mandela as a terrorist while Glasgow was giving him the freedom of the city. And she remembered the Scottish Government freeing the Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi. Both of those things, Marie told me, made her think: lsquoScotland can be dferentrsquo.Marie is self-evidently not alone: Irsquove spoken to lots of Left or Left-adjacent voters whorsquove come to the same conclusion. But for every Marie Irsquove spoken to, Irsquove also spoken to other voters on the Left who are not so certain or have come to a dferent view. Traditional Labour voters have gone both ways and those whorsquove gone for Yes make up the vast majority of the new recruits to independence. Certainly, whenever Irsquove spoken to people among the Yes grassroots, itrsquos hard to find anyone whorsquos ever regularly voted LibDem or Tory.This is signicant because it helps explain the vote in the middle-ground between Yes and No and its changeability, particularly in an election dominated by Brexit. Those on the Left are more likely to be Remainers and to be concerned about the effects of Brexit on society and therersquos a crossover with Yes supportersndash the YouGov poll found support for independence among those who voted Remain was %, more than twice what it was among Leavers.The problem here for the Yes campaign is that left-leaning Remainers do not always reach the same conclusion about Scottish nationalism, Brexit and Labour, which may help explain the drop in support for independence. Nouveau nationalists whorsquove been flirting with Yes are now faced with the chance of a Corbyn governmentthey are also faced with the possibility of a Tory win and a Boris Brexit.:General Election: Key Scottish battlegroundsSo what will they do  On the face of it, it would seem logical that the chances of Brexit and a Tory win would send progressive, Remainer voters rushing into the arms of the SNP and Yes, but itrsquos not as simple as that. As professor of politics Rob Johns pointed out to The Herald on Sunday, the Brexit effect may have highlighted the dficulties independence could bring. And for some nouveau nationalists, this is particularly troubling:Brexit is bad for the economy and hurts the weakest in society, what on Earth will independence do Other factors may be at play in the dip in support for independence. Some voters may be leaning a little more towards Corbyn and therefore a little further away from independence because of the election campaign. Butthatrsquos true, it wonrsquot necessarily translate into votes for Labour in Scotland. Thatrsquos the weird, unpredictable thing about modern politics: Scotland used to be ided by Right and Left, now itrsquos ided by No and Yes and thatrsquos had a profound effect on party loyalties itrsquos all a lot more fluid than it was.Which means, ultimately, that what the nouveau nationalists decide to do could be crucial. We already know that some voters in Scotland will vote tactically against the SNP, which is why support for the Tories in Scotland has been rising. But we also know that there are voters who separate a vote in a general election from a vote in an independence referendum, which is why some unionists will vote for the SNP this time because of Brexit.But the real battle ndash in the general election and in another referendum on independence ndash is in the middle-ground over left-leaning, Labour-inclined voters. Another poll at the weekend showed that only % of SNP-minded voters and % of Tories might change their mind about who to vote for at this election, but for people minded to support Labour that shoots up to %. These are the voters in the choppy waters between Labour and the SNP, Leave and Remain, and Yes and No. What they decide to do will decide our future."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-leonard-labour-uk-government-diminish-appetite-independence","story":"In an interview with the PA News agency ahead of the vote on December , the Scottish Labour leader said his partyrsquos plans to invest in public services and communities across the country would offer a radical change to the Tories after a decade of austerity.Read more:Jackson Carlaw insists lsquonothing to be afraid ofrsquo in Nicola SturgeonHe said Labour would commit to abolishing the House of Lords ndash replacing it with a second chamber for the nations and regions ndash in a bid to decentralise power in the UK.We have one week to change the course of our countryrsquos history.

The energy produced is enough to power an estimated , homes, but environmentalists claim biomass energy isn’t as green as it appears.Scotlands biomass sites generate enough energy to power , homes.When people think of clean energy, wind turbines and solar  often come to mind.But biomass power plants – a less well-known method of generating renewable electricity – are booming across the UK and environmental campaigners have raised doubts about their green credentials.The burning of trees or plant matter – known as plant biomass – now accounts for more than a fth of the UK’s renewable energy, second only to wind power.The number of plant biomass power plants in the UK has more than trebled in four years, from  in  to  in .Between them, they now produce enough energy to power around . million homes, analysis by the JPIMedia Data Unit has found.In Scotland, the number has quadrupled from  biomass sites in  to  by . Unlike other forms of green energy, biomass plants produce greenhouse gases. Across the country, the rise in biomass means its total greenhouse gas emissions have nearly reached the amount produced by coal. The industry says wood is sourced from renewable forests, with new trees being planted which store carbon and help to offset the emissions produced.But with the environment proving a key policy battleground in this year’s General Election, campaigners are calling for the practice to come under more scrutiny.Katja Garson, forest and climate campaigner at European campaign group Fern, said: “It is very concerning that in the global push to reduce emissions, more is not being said about the climate impacts of harvesting and burning wood.” Critics have also raised concerns that some power plants ship wood in from overseas, saying this has an added impact on the environment.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Controversial baby names.\"  Baby Names : here are the top  most controversial baby names for girlsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Launching this years festive campaign, the first since the introduction of new drug-driving laws, are, from left, Chief Inspector Darren Faulds, Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, and Superintendent Louise Blakelock, Police Scotlands Deputy Head of Road Policing.\"  Zero tolerance approach to both drink and drug driving this festive season viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"The UK now imports . million tonnes of wood pellets a year, more than  times the amount imported a decade ago. Most comes from the USA and Canada, data from the Office for National Statistics shows.Campaigners are also urging the Government to rethink the £. billion in annual subsidies that the biomass industry gets.Almuth Ernsting, of the pressure group Biofuelwatch, said the Government should redirect subsidies to “genuinely low-carbon renewable energy” instead.“For the climate, electricity from forest biomass is no better than electricity from coal,” she said. “Both are completely incompatible with the need to rapidly reduce carbon emissions.”However, Benedict McAleenan, senior advisor to the Renewable Energy Association, said: “Pretending that biomass is somehow no better than coal means ignoring a whole host of facts. “It particularly misunderstands the way forestry works, ignores the important role of regulations and forgets the fact that trees are being regrown all the time.“In reality, UK rules are world-leading and prevent unsustainable practices.”Mr McAleenan said technology being developed called Carbon Capture and Storage would allow biomass plants to “suck carbon out of the atmosphere”, reducing the emissions they produce.He said it would not be possible for the UK to hit net zero-carbon without using bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage.Scotland’s carbon reduction ambitions came a step closer with ground-breaking new charter signed by Government and industry last week. A new alliance of industry, academics and Government officially launched Scotland’s programme to deliver the country’s programme of industrial decarbonisation through the deployment of the UK’s first carbon capture, usage and storagetechnology. The industry led coalition, known as NECCUS, will be instrumental in driving forward the development of CCUS which is recognised as essentialScotland is to meet its target of reducing the country’s carbon emissions to net zero by . CCUS is becoming increasingly commonplace around the world as a way of mitigating climate change. At its simplest, the technology involves capturing the carbon that is emitted from power plantsor energy intensive industries such as chemical and steel producers and then storing the greenhouse gas safely and permanently in rock formations deep below the seabed. Scotland’s project will take this technique further by creating hydrogen which can be used as an alternative to high carbon fuels such as coal, oil and gas for heat and power. CCUS coupled with hydrogen production alongside renewable energy and reforestation – as well as more sustainable production of food and consumer goods – is seen as an essential component of Scotland’s carbon emission reduction target five years before the rest of the UK.The first CCUS plant is expected to be operational by .Mike Smith, NECCUS CEO, said: “We’ve made great progress with wind, solar and other renewable technologies over the last  years. “But the need to decarbonise our economy is urgent so we must build on the good start the UK has made by addressing the hard to decarbonise sectors like heat, heavy industry, transport, and chemicals. “The only way we can achieve that is with the deployment of CCUS. NECCUS, with its unrivalled support from all sectors of industry, academia and Government is now set to deliver on doing just that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : pmThe shadow health minister for Scotland, David Stewart, has tabled a motion in the Scottish Parliament congratulating The Orcadian on its OUTREACHCLAN campaign which more than doubled its £, target amount.

The then minister for transport and the islands stated in June  that we did not have the financial resources to extend the scheme to business-related travel and that remains the case.”The Air Discount Scheme was introduced in  by the former MSP for Shetland, Tavish Scott. At that time, work-related travel was included, recognising, in part, that providing a more level playing field for island businesses was key to sustaining population. In April , the government at the time cut business travel for the scheme, insisting that it broke EU rules.Ministers have since been forced to admit that this was untrue and that the decision had been taken for cost-cutting reasons.Mr McArthur said: “This reply from the cabinet secretary is just the latest in a long line of untruths spun by this SNP government in relation to the Air Discount Scheme. When Tavish Scott first introduced ADS in , it covered all flights taken by islanders to and from the Scottish mainland, with the exception of medical flights. It was designed this way, in part, to help businesses in the Northern Isles contribute to their communities and compete on a more level playing field with mainland firms.“For Mr Matheson to state that business-related travel has never been eligible under the scheme, therefore, is flat out wrong. Just as his predecessors were entirely wrong in claiming the decision by the SNP government to cut business-related travel from the scheme was required under EU state aid rules.“Rather than continue to try re-writing history, Mr Matheson should do the right thing and reverse this cut.”Responding, a Transport Scotland spokesman said: #The Air Discount Scheme directly tackles the issue of high air fares in the Highlands and Islands and underlines our commitment to supporting remote communities. “We are committed to continuing the scheme, which provides a  per cent subsidy for eligible passengers and is the highest possible discount under European regulations. Earlier this year, we widened the eligibility area for the scheme to include the entire Caithness postcode, as well as further parts of Sutherland.“The Air Discount Scheme is designed for use by inidual residents in the eligible areas as a means to facilitate improved social cohesion. It is not for the benefit of public bodies or private companies or to subsidise their travel costs.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Yet nothing is certain. Boris Johnson could still miss the goal spectacularly like Diana Ross famously missed that penalty at the ‘ World Cup opening ceremony.He undoubtedly has flair and talent, but can he be trusted to deliver  That has been the central issue that has limited his undoubted appeal and held him back from achieving an unassailable lead.At the outset of the campaign I argued that the election was Boris Johnson’s to lose. The danger facing him was that having benefitted from the public’s growing sense of grievance about Parliament obstructing the deliverance of Brexit he might be drawn into fighting on the ground of his opponents choosing where he could be more easily beaten. He might lose points on the NHS, he might be outflanked on social care or ridiculed for increasing police numbers that his party originally cut. Whatever the issue, Johnson had to remind the public that the general election had been called earlier than should be expected, and thatthey truly wanted to end their boredom and exhaustion with Brexit they must make a choice between giving him a majority – or sending him packing.In the end, from my own admittedly subjective viewpoint, Johnson has managed to hold on to a diminished lead because his main opponents have been unable to land any signicant blows. Indeed the very question of being able to trust Johnson that has been levelled at him by other leaders such as Corbyn, Sturgeon and Swinson has only raised the questions of trust in them.Labour’s revered Aunt Sally – the threat posed to the NHS by the dreaded Tories – becomes less convincing each time she is wheeled out in her bathchair. Thanks to the changing demographics a lot more demand is putting a strain on resources and with changing technology the costs rise further. NHS costs keep going up and this will not change whichever party governs the nation. Labour can argue you can’t trust the Tories on the NHS all it wants but it rings hollow when we know they say this every election and that every time they are in office they increase spending on the NHS – even during the period of austerity when other departments had their budgets cut.Nor do the attacks from Labour and the SNP about the threat of privatisation of NHS services have credibility.Their idea was to use President Trump as a bogey man but my MEP colleague Henrik Overgaard-Nin, a practising dentist and former head of the General Dental Practice Committee, utterly demolished this thesis last week by categorising how it has been the European Union forcing the growth of private provision of services in the NHS. Likewise it is the EU that was pushing a trade deal with President Obama that could have opened up the NHS further.In all of these points it is those such as Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson who by fighting to deliver Brexit are the real defenders of the NHS remaining accountable to the British electorate.In Scotland, the claims of Nicola Sturgeon are especially weak. The scandals of the tragic and avoidable deaths of children in Glasgow’s new infirmary due to contaminated water, and the unopened Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh costing an extra £ million that leaves her especially vulnerable to an accusation of rank hypocrisy. Claims about trust on law and order under Johnson – made after his promise to recruit , more police in England when it was the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats who originally reduced their numbers following the great recession – have no value when put by other parties who have their own records to feel ashamed about. This week in London the th murder was committed, surpassing last year’s total of  with three weeks of  still to go. The comparison of Johnson’s record as London mayor against the current Labour incumbent, Sadiq Khan, puts labour in the dock, not the Tories. Likewise the state of Scottish policing was brought into sharp focus by the resignation of Susan Deacon as the chair of the Scottish Police Authority claiming its governance and accountability is fundamentally flawed.While the issue of trust has undoubtedly undermined the Boris Johnson campaign it has not been a knockout blow, for sadly too many politicians come with the same reputational challenge about trust. Nicola Sturgeon promised the  independence referendum was “once in a generation” then “once in a letime” vote but started campaigning for a second referendum practically from the moment her campaign was defeated. At first she was careful enough to suggest it might take a few years but now, five years on and she has been pressing incessantly for a second vote – certainly not a generation later.Corbyn has his reputational problem with past associations with terrorist groups and now wishes to take our industrial relations back to the unrest of the seventies. Then there is labour’s ant-Semitism problem. Do people really trust Jeremy Corbyn The largest issue of trust for me is Johnson’s claim that only he can “get Brexit done”. It is proving a convincing slogan with the public fit to burst over the incessant parliamentary infighting and sharp practices to deliver a deal that suits the EU and leaves our country ided. I do not accept Boris’s “deal’ is anything other than an attempt to move the issue out of the public eye and play down the further capitulations of the UK’s interest that are yet to come. I fully expect the Prime Minister to get his majority and therefore get his deal through parliament – but I do not expect him to secure anything like the free trade deal with the EU that he claims is within his gt, nor do I expect him to go for leaving without a deal – so I foresee yet another extension to our membership after the end of .That’s why we need Brexit Party MPs to press Johnson to deliver, without them millions will have no voice. I would like to think I am wrong but this Brexit General Election could well prove fruitless and undermine public trust in politicians even more.Brian Monteith MEP is Chief Whip of the Brexit Party in the European Parliament.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch brexit won t get done if boris wins an snp backed labour government is safer bet","story":"#Getting Brexit done# will simply continue to overshadow everything , says Lesley Riddoch.If the Tories get a working majority on Thursday, as predicted, will Boris Johnson actually get Brexit done  Will politicsto something like normal Even at a time of fairytales, flying reindeer, Wise Men and Tinkerbell most adults realise the answer to both questions is a resounding no.Passing Boris Johnson’s Withdrawal Agreementmarks only the end of the beginning – the first stage of a bitter, contested orce which moves on to the financial settlement and future trade negotiations. These must be concluded more speedily than any similar deal in political history andthe shambolic UK negotiating team fails – by accident or by design – the inhabitants of Britain will face the same “no deal” clf edge next Christmas that was supposedly seen off in .This much we know. Every news bulletin and parliamentary debate will continue to be dominated by Brexit in . Uncertainty will blight investment, job security, le-plans, recruitment and the quality of public services. The unbelievable total of , nursing vacancies in the English NHS will not diminish but increase as EU workers finally depart for good. There will be no Golden Age for public services – why should there be when the new boss is actually the old boss  At a deeper level, how can Brexit ever “get done” when leaving is bitterly opposed by millions of voters who will neither abandon their commitment to European identity, nor be accommodated in any way by the new Prime Minister. Thus, Europe will only become more isive and totemic as an issue and will continue to distract from the seismic issues of inequality, climate crisis, and democratic modernisation the entire British political system has chosen to ignore. Most Tory voters and even Brexit supporters know this in their hearts.They back Boris, not to get Brexit done but because he’s the one who lets them dream a while longer, indulges make-believe, allows disorientated people to take respite from the bleakness and empty affluence his party has created with the vain hope of making Britain great again. No harsh realities, dficult choices or tough reappraisals from Santa Johnson. You only have to believe in his magical powers, his innate superiority and his bona fides. Or pretend. It’s like an electoral version of the Stockholm syndrome. Some depressing yet powerful human dynamics are at work.So, a Boris win is likely – but looking on the bright side, a Tory majority would change the thrust of political debate in early .Firstly, it would rob Boris Johnson of the chance to keep posing as the champion of The People against an evil, unresponsive, high-handed Remainer Parliament. If he becomes Prime Minister again, that “self-serving political elite” will largely be his own hand-picked “do or die” foot-soldiers. Any mistakes, delays, crassness or missed deadlines will be entirely and demonstrably his fault and no-one ’s. Alienated Tory big beasts like John Major will join with expelled grandees like Michael Heseltine to rub the new leader’s nose in it – and he must watch for signs of mutiny amongst hisloyal band of lieutenants Gove, Hancock, Javid and Raab – all of whom wanted to be leader themselves. At the first sign of trouble they could try to challenge Johnson, supported by Jeremy Hunt and Theresa May on the backbenches, nursing their wrath to keep it piping hot.Boris may be the darling of the Tory Party membership, but he will have very few friends in Parliament or , in the capital city. Is Johnson an accomplished political tightrope walker – we may soon find out.Secondly, an overall majority would probably also rob Boris of his best recruiting sergeant – Jeremy Corbyn. Not even Teflon Tony could have withstood the sustained and concerted hatchet-job Corbyn has faced every waking day for the last five weeks. The Labour leader has made the media’s job easier than it needed to be, but he’s also overseen a much-needed policy alignment. If Labour’s popular programme of renationalisation and public ownership is wedded to a new, more articulate and assertive leader – Boris will face real, spirited political opposition every inch of the way in . Thirdly, a Boris working majority would also end the absurdity of Arlene Foster and the DUP \u2028representing the views of Remain voting Northern Ireland. Greens and other small parties won’t stand against some Alliance and SDLP candidates, so there’s a chance Ms Foster’s personal authority will be seriously clipped – and that this could precipitate the much-predicted break-up of Britain.Astonishingly, it’s influential parts of the London media who’ve decided that’s on the cards.Channel Four anchor Jon Snow is travelling around the Celtic nations, making a series of films about dissatisfaction in the devolved nations. Radio Four’s flagship World this Weekend is planning an hour-long debate on the future of the United Kingdom for next week. Doubtless, more is planned.It’s ironic. The Conservatives have won elections in the teeth of fierce opposition from Scots for decades. But Brexit has finally thrown that crushing unfairness into sharp relief and a supportive media spotlight. So too have recent opinion polls which suggest a majority of Scots would support independenceBoris Johnson triggers withdrawal from the EU. London’s sudden interest in Scotland’s constitutional bind is welcome, but dangerous too. Enthusiasm may soon waneScots don’t live up to our newfound billing as the Remain rebels who Won’t Stand For Brexit. Unfairly, since no smaller member of this “family of nations” has yet found a way to exercise authority or be heard. But the British media doesn’t do fair, patient, marginal or incremental. So, the pressure will not relent. Brexit won’t get doneBoris wins the vote. And an SNP-supported Corbyn government is still a much better bet.

Wealth and power imbalances stop people with erse lived experiences from interacting, negotiating and working to understand each other, but more importantly to negotiate a common good that is equitable. “We should never forget that much of our own culture and infrastructure is a product of imperialism and dominance. Built on tobacco and cotton harvested by enslaved people, profits from people starved and forced off their land, or backbreaking heavy industries, Glasgow has the opportunity to create a new future.”The blueprint – which envisages Glasgow being “globally recognised as a leading creative and cultural world city” – highlights how it is now home to  dferent cultural organisations, including the national orchestra, theatre, opera, and ballet companies, and is also “blazing an internationally acclaimed trail in contemporary art, design and music”.However, it also states that although culture has been “central to Glasgow’s evolution for at least  years, the city should not be constrained by so much reverence for the past that the new can never become established”.A spokesman for Glasgow Le, which runs cultural venues for the council, said: “This new plan has been developed to build on all that the city has achieved and is a starting point for a renewed conversation led by Glasgow’s creative community.“We want to consolidate Glasgow’s position as a truly international arts capital – nurturing and showcasing the best in local and international creativity, design and music.“We would encourage anyone with a role in the sector to respond to the draft plan and have their say during the consultation period to help shape the final version.”David McDonald, deputy leader of the city council and chair of Glasgow Le, said: “Our new draft plan seeks to set out what the city can do to ensure that culture in Glasgow continues to flourish over the next  years.We know that participation in culture – whether it’s watching a play, creating your own piece of art or singing a song - is a force for good, and an enabler of community empowerment that can increase our quality of le. In Glasgow, we have a vibrant cultural sector that gives the city an edge. It inspires, questions and challenges us to see our city and the world in dferent ways.Having just been named as the UK’s top cultural city we need to now create the conditions in which our confident cultural sector can develop and grow, and where our artists are nurtured in their work.”For all the latest Scottish news, sport and features click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dani garavelli neither of the big parties has a monopoly on bigotry","story":"Even by its usual skewed standards, Friday#s Dailywas remarkable: five broadsheet pages on anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. And nothing on Islamophobia within the Conservative Party.Admittedly the splash headline “Corbyn has made Labour a welcoming refuge for anti-Semites” was legitimate. It was taken from the Jewish Labour Movement’s submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commissioninquiry. And what a damning submission it was.It said the party to which its members belonged “promotes anti-Semites to positions of power does not take actionagainst those guilty of abhorrent anti-Semitism victimises those who speak out against anti-Semitism fails to protect Jewish members from anti-Semitism allows Jewish MPs to be hounded out of their political home and derides the issue of anti-Semitism to the extent that its very existence within the party is denied.” Such criticism was not unexpected. In the past decade Corbyn has been involved in a succession of incidents – from his defence of an anti-Semitic mural in Tower Hamlets to the glowing foreword he wrote to a book laden with anti-Semitic tropes – which appeared to validate suggestions he was fostering a culture of racism. To understand the impact this has had on Jewish members one need only look as far as East Renfrewshire – home to the largest Jewish community in Scotland. For more than  years this constituency ed Jim Murphy, Blairite and one-time member of the Labour Friends of Israel group, as its MP. Last week, the current Labour candidate Carolann Davidson told a Glasgow Jewish Representative Councilhustings the Labour Party did not deserve their vote. She said she’d only come to reassure them some Labour politicians refused to surrender to racism.With Jewish MPs including Luciana Berger forced out, you would have to be a tinfoil-hat-wearing conspiracy theorist to believe Corbyn was being ly smeared . You might wonderfive full pages on the EHRC investigation and no pages on – for example – the poverty that is blighting the lives of hundreds of thousands of children at Christmas – was politically motivated. And you might go on to surmise that, while all racism is equally bad, some forms of racism are less equally bad than others.While Corbyn is suffering as a result of his failure to address anti-Semitism, Boris Johnson is shrugging off quite blatant Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry, such as Sally-Ann Hart’s claim that learning disabled people should earn less because “they don’t understand money.”We know Johnson is racist, because racist sentiments so often pop out of his racist mouth. He has talked about “piccaninnies with water melon smiles” and compared Muslim women to letter boxes. In , he described Islamophobia as the natural reaction to Islam, while in  he suggested Malaysian women coming to UK universities were looking for a man to marry.Like Corbyn, he has promised to root out the problem while continuing to support those who embody it. He promoted Zac Goldsmith to his cabinet despite Goldsmith’s Islamophobic London mayoral campaign against Sadiq Khan, and he continues to employ Tommy Robinson’s pal Chloe Westley as an aide.You can detect the same notes of betrayal in the voices of Berger and Conservative peer Sayeeda Warsi, who described the past four years as like being in an abusive relationship. She spoke after discovering a promised internal investigation into Islamophobia was to be watered down to “an investigation into prejudice of all kinds”.The incidents of Islamophobia go all the way down into the grassroots of the party. Earlier this year, the Conservatives suspended  party members for a string of abusive social media posts, including one that called for all Muslims to be turfed out of public office.Then, last month,  sitting and former Tory councillors were suspended in another social media scandal in which one poster referred to Muslims as “the enemy within”.The party insists such suspensions are evidence of a zero tolerance approach. What, then, are we to make of ministers Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock, Andrea Leadsom and Thérèse Coffey, who have been out on the campaign trail supporting candidates facing claims of Islamophobia  Meanwhile Channel ’s misquoting of Johnson – it claimed he uttered he words: “people of colour” when, in fact, he said “people of talent” – is \u2028being touted as evidence he is not prejudiced. In fact it is merely evidence that, now and again, he remembers not to gt-wrap racist ideology in racist rhetoric.This “talent” quote is a sanitised expression of an immigration policy that created a hostile environment for asylum seekers and deported British citizens back to the West Indies. Let’s not get too outraged with C for mishearing something that, to most people, seemed entirely plausible. And, while criticising Corbyn for failing to apologise for anti-Semitism during his Andrew Neil interview, let’s not forget Johnson wouldn’t submit to the Neil interrogation. And that his response to questions about Islamophobia in the latest leaders’ debate was to change the subject back to Brexit.All this measuring of Labour and Tory sins should not be reduced to whataboutery. But it very often is. The way in which the partiesturn examples of their rivals’ racism into anti-ballistic missile systems capable of combating their own is demoralising This election should not be a game of bigotry Top Trumps. The Conservative Party’s racism does nothing to dilute the Labour Party’s nor ought there to be some hierarchy of hatred. Still, it is worth asking why there is so much focus on one type of racism, while another is seen as more trivial. And why – when the concept of anti-Semitism is rightly sacrosanct – the Spectator and other right-wing publications feel free to carry columns suggesting Islamophobia is a fiction created to silence criticism of fundamentalism  The consequences of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are almost identical: fear, hurt, and radicalisation within affected communities, and a rise in hate crime towards them. Othering is othering is othering. Whether you are a Hasidic Jew visiting the synagogue in Gfnock or a bearded Muslim attending a mosque in Pollokshields, the misery of being insulted, spat at or attacked is the same. It is to be hoped the EHRC launches an investigation into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party as it has into anti-Semitism in Labour to reinforce that any form of racial discrimination is unacceptable and must be rooted out. And that – instead of posturing and preicating and pointing to each others’ flaws – all the parties will come to a consensus on the iniquity of religious ethnic hatred: for the sake of social cohesion and so their own exiled members canto the fold.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon suggests brexit referendum would be held before second vote on scottish independence","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has suggested that a referendum on Brexit would be held before a second vote on Scottish independence.Scotlands First Minister said that Labours intention to hold an EU poll within six months of being elected - with a choice between Remain and a deal negotiated by Jeremy Corbyn - would indicate that a Brexit vote would be first on the ballot.Ms Sturgeon reiterated her view that another Scottish referendum should be held towards the end of .Speaking on the BBCs Good Morning Scotland programme, the First Minister said: \"It looks asthe EU onewould come first and then an independence referendum towards the end of next year.

O’Coineen has the ultimate dinner table boast – more people have been to the moon than have sailed around the world .This lonesome boatman’s ticket to sail came in the form of the Vendée Globe, the effectively year-long, round-the-world yacht race in which there is as much focus on finishing as in winning.It’s a risky business sailing into the tempest and braving both elements and unwelcome contact at night or in fog from fellow-vessels from military warships to cruise liners — one of which turned around at the insistence of worried passengers to check on the safety of our hero in his tiny skf.Replete with end-of-chapter tips and an introduction by President Higgins, Journey to the Edge is a lively and luminating read the perfect companion to his ’s business-primer memoir, The Unsinkable Entrepreneur.Now that he’s at the wheel of the Sunday Business Post — reborn as the Business Post at the weekend — O’Coineen is sure to have many adventures ahead, both on the high seas and on terra firma.Let’s leave the last word then with this Irish-speaking voyager proud to be flying the flag for the great seafaring nation of Ireland: “In a bizarre way, after achieving my sailing goal and dream, I can now set new horizons and get real joy, satisfaction and fulfilment in helping others achieve theirs. While in the process…my le was on hold and now I feel lucky to be starting the rest of it. This is about goals, visions and horizons. Without these, little would happen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-11.41.03.png","title":"jake mac siacais to launch autobiography","story":"“MEMORY is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool”. It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they missed my sickness for 23 years and today its","story":"AN Oldpark woman has been diagnosed with a rare spinal illness –  years after being injured in a fall.Margaret Reevessays a scan revealed her condition in , but she was only told about it when she became one of the patients recalled last year by under-investigation neurologist Dr Michael Watt. Now, after waitingnearly a quarter-of-a-century for a correct diagnosis, she’s been told it’s too late for her to be cured of the spinal disorder spondylotic myelopathy.Margaret’s story began in  when she suffered a bad fall and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra in her neck after a visit to the Mater. Days later, she was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital who put the pain she was suffering down to an extra congenital rib that she was born with. Her chronic battle with pain took its toll to the extent that she had to quit her job in the Civil Service.Speaking to the North Belfast News in her Cedar Avenue flat, Margaret explained her long and painful journey to the truth began  years after her first fall.“I started having a series of bad falls in ,” she said. “In short, I was passed around dferent neurologists. I knew in my heart that something was wrong.“I was breaking bones all over my body. I just couldn’t balance. I was a patient of Dr Michael Watt. He diagnosed me with epilepsy, but I never took the medication because I never believed I had epilepsy.”On being recalled by Dr Watt last year, Margaret found out for the first time what a scan from the past had revealed.“It wasn’t until the recall that I was told a scan in  showed I had chronic spondylotic myelopathy, but now it was now too serious to be cured. I had been passed between neurology wards and GPs for over  years and the reality was that my diagnosis was known in  but nobody told me.“I only found out I had this condition because I was a recall patient for something .“How many more people are out there similar to me who haven’t been diagnosed with myelopathy “It is estimated that one in four people could have it. I would say to anyone who suffers from compression in the back, slipped discs, oryou are dropping things or have tingling in the hands, that you may have myelopathy.”A tearful Margaret added: “I will end up in a wheelchair. I will lose the power of my arms and not be able to feed myself because my diagnosis went on so long.“I feel very alone. I don’t know anyone  with it.“The sad reality is that this condition can be preventedit is discovered early enough.”Margaret wants to use her heartbreaking story to reach out to others and raise awareness of myelopathy to let them know they are not alone.She recently ed from a trip to New York to meet fellow patients and top neurologists from across the world at a myelopathy conference.“Myelopathy is out there but people don’t know they have it,” she added. “I want to focus on the disease and its progressionnot treated. Myelopathy is a degenerative disease and there are guidelines on when to operate.“Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t treated sooner and it may have slowed the condition down.“I suffered for years not knowing what was wrong with me.“There is no support here in Northern Ireland. I don’t know where I would be without the support of myelopathy.org, Spinal Injuries Association and AOSpine as well as Cambridge University who are pioneering more research and work into the condition.“We need to talk about myelopathy. If I was living in England I would have been treated quicker.“I am worried about the future because it has been left to deteriorate for so long.”Margaret said she wanted to thank Belfast Back Care for their treatment and Archie Coogan for his holistic therapies.If you suffer from, or believe you suffer from, myelopathy, you can get in touch with Margaret Reeves atMargaret-@hotmail."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tourism numbers soar in west belfast","story":"A new report has shown that West Belfast welcomed record number of tourists this year.Figures recorded for  thus far have shown at least  million visitor trips in this part of the city.Research commissioned by West Belfast tourism body Fáilte Feirste Thiar shows a dramatic increase in people visiting our local attractions, which have helped generate millions for the city’s economy. The staggering tourism data represents an almost  per cent visitor increase since  when over  million vistor trips were recorded.Fáilte Feirste Thiar Executive Director, Harry Connolly, said the record numbers were indicative of the “world class” attractions on offer in West Belfast.“Two million visitors have engaged with our established, world class visitor attractions and that includes the Coiste Political Walking Tours, Black Taxi Tours, people downloading the mural map and discovering the our murals by themselves, or visiting the new James Connolly Visitor Centre,” he said.“West Belfast also offers an urban and rural mix, where people can go to the Bog Meadows and the Belfast Hills or they can go to the city and see what our community has to offer.”He added: “The off-season in West Belfast used to be a lot longer, but that’s shortening and it shows that we are now a year-round destination.”Amongst this year’s tourism highlights were the opening of the new James Connolly Visitor Centre and the annual Féile an Phobail, which welcomed the world to West Belfast with hundreds of events including Michael Conlan’s headline bout in the Falls Park. While celebrating our culture and heritage, Mr Connolly said that the hospitality and tourism industry now employs , local people, who are boosting “regeneration”.“This is , homes, families and jobs sustained, which is enormous,” he said.“When we were established we wanted to ensure that tourism was part of the overall programme for social and economic regeneration. “You can really see now how tourism is having a very positive and profound impact on social and economic development of West Belfast.”Not content to rest on their laurels, Fáilte Feirste Thiar are already looking to  with the aim of bringing even more tourists to the area.“As we approach , we believe that we have a firm foundation in place to make sure that West Belfast’s potential is realised,” Harry enthused.“What will help us achieve that is new world class transformational projects. In , we look forward to seeing the development of the Roddy McCorley Society Museum and interactive visitor’s centre. “Of course, in the early part of  we hope to see permission granted to allow Casement Park to be granted, which will be an absolute game-changer. “We see the continued growth of Féile an Phobail, we hope to have Michael Conlan back in the Falls Park to win a world title, and we look forward to the enormous event that will be.”Commenting on the latest figures, outgoing West Belfast MP and Fáilte Feirste Thiar Chairperson, Paul Maskey, said: “When you look at the numbers it’s absolutely phenomenal. “Other parts of this city are now looking at West Belfast to learn and to see what lessons they can take from it moving forward. “Fáilte Feirste Thiar is engaging with organisations in other parts of the city to help them do that.“Tourism is vitally important for our economy in West Belfast and it is sustaining many jobs in the area, and that includes restaraunts, shops, bars and clubs.”He added: “We want to increase those numbers in the time ahead, and it is our job to do that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"3000 attend derry lundy","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

People Before Profits Gerry Carroll is also aiming to repeat his achievements in recent elections.This constituency has seen signicant development in recent years, including the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre, but it is still pockmarked by high levels of unemployment and deprivation.However, West Belfast has also largely reinvented itself as a tourism destination, turning the Troubles into an attraction.Read MoreConstituency Profile: DUPs Shannon all but certain to see off Alliance in StrangfordAds for the area urge tourists to \"visit Clonard Monastery with its sumptuous Rose window\" and \"walk up Divis or Black Mountain and be spoilt for choice for somewhere to eat afterwards\".The internationally popular Lonely Planet guide says: \"Though scarred by three decades of civil unrest, the former battleground of west Belfast is one of the most compelling places to visit in Northern Ireland.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSet\"The Falls Road and Shankill Road are adorned with famous murals expressing local political and religious passions, and are ided by the infamous Peace Line, separating Catholic and Protestant communities.\"The glossy language and hyperbole mask an area still scarred with social problems, including the highest poverty levels in Northern Ireland.A tongue-in-cheek letter to the Irish News last month poked fun at the achievements and verbal ability of the abstentionist Mr Maskey, who has held the seat since Gerry Adams decided to run in the Republic.Paul MaskeyThe mischievous letter drew a reply a few days later, questioning the original letters veracity, but there is little doubt Maskey will romp home. He enjoys the largest majority of any Northern Ireland MP.What he may lack in vocal dexterity he more than makes up for on social media, tweeting last week that Santa had taken a few hours off to support striking health service workers \"who had all been good boys and girls this year\".Mr McCoubrey, the veteran DUP candidate, also has a Twitter account, which tends to retweet Nigel Dodds a lot, but he came second place to Mr Maskey last time round.Mr McCoubrey also pushed Mr Carroll into third after the People Before Profit man slashed Mr Maskeys majority two years earlier and amassed % of the vote.Frank McCoubreyMr Maskey said his recovery was \"no fluke\" but was down to hard work and delivery.Major talking points within the constituency include proposals for  new homes at the Glenmona site near Upper Springfield and the failure after more than , days to get planning approval for the new Casement Park plans.Mr Maskey has been vocal on both issues. \"I have families who have been on waiting lists for up to nine years. The shortage of social housing is one of the biggest issues,\" he said.\"I have pointed out to planners that applications lodged after Casement have been approved. It will be the jewel in the crown of West Belfast.\"Big-ticket issues such as Brexit are also to the fore. West Belfast had the second highest vote for Remain in the  referendum .Ongoing violence is also an issue, however.Two weeks ago, a family had a lucky escape after an air freshener exploded on top of a wood burning stove, a few days after a pipe bomb was defused in a front garden.Mr McCoubrey has claimed the unionist vote in the area has almost doubled in recent years, leaving the DUP \"knocking on the door\" in West Belfast.Gerry CarrollMr Carroll has also insisted that his aim is to win the seat, though his campaign will also be seen as a dry run for the next Assembly election.Alliance candidate Donnamarie Higgins said the constituency needed a strong pro-Remain voice and argued change is possible \"when people vote for it\" as they have in a pro-Alliance surge which saw the party take the third MEP seat this year.New party Aontu will be interesting to watch, particularly in terms how many votes it can take from Sinn Fein.Candidate Monica Digney said: \"Irish MPs north and south  years ago did not stand idly by like Sinn Fein do today. They refused to go to Westminster but went to Dublin, which is what we will do, demanding the right to represent people here.\"SDLP stalwart Alex Attwood has, after many years of struggle, left the battleground and, apparently, politics altogether.His long-serving councillor brother, Tim Attwood, polled just under , votes in the constituency, a fall of %, and came in fourth.The constituency has expanded in the recent past, taking in Dunmurry and the northern part of the Derriaghy council ward in , but the change did not affect the proportion of Catholics to Protestants.

Its by no means purely an SDLP team. Two Green Party activists and two former Womens Coalition members are there.The candidate needs to secure support from outside her partys usual voting base, and the evidence from the doors is that shes doing that.\"I normally vote Alliance, but youll get my preference this time because I think youre the person to oust our current Westminster representative\" a man tells her.\"If you lend me your vote, Ill look after it,\" Hanna pledges.A Co Armagh teacher says: \"I usually vote People Before Profit, but Im with you in this election.

Many know her from the school gates or parks.

Weve a lot of bright young things who will be eager to take the Assembly seat off me in a heartbeat,\" she explains.A pensioner advises her that she should fight this election not just by knocking doors, but on social media as well. \"I dont know anything about it myself, but you must get on all those sites the young people are on Claire,\" she urges.Michael Westland offers a cup of tea and more. \"There are five votes in this house, Claire, you dont need to ask,\" he says.Youre one of the few intelligent politicians on TV. Youre logical, rational and you dont tell lies.MichaelThe compliments for Hanna come so thick and fast at the doors - \"You echo what I think\", \"I trust you\", \"You keep my faith in politics\" - that its almost embarrassing for her.She blushes and jokes to one voter that all the praise means \"its like being at your own funeral\".On a two-hour canvass, there are only three out-and-out noes for the SDLP woman. One family is solid DUP. A man looks at the SDLP leaflet through his glass door and shakes his head. Another man opens his but the conversation is brief. When asked by Hanna what the big issues are for him, he replies: \"My dinner!\" She admires the handsome Christmas wreaths bursting with pine cones and blood-red berries hanging from many doors. Election demands mean shes behind on the Christmas front herself, \"although the kids do have an Advent calendar, and the decorations are out but not up\".Over in the religiously mixed middle-class Sicily Park in Finaghy, Alliances Paula Bradshaw is setting a brisk pace. Its late afternoon and most householders arent in, but she posts signed and timed leaflets through their doors.Alliance’s Paula Bradshaw Privately, she must be annoyed that almost every journalist and commentator is putting Hanna ahead in the Alliance-SDLP race for the Remain vote. Yet admirably she doesnt complain.\"Im not taking it personally and I can understand why Im not the favourite to win this seat. I think I would have been had the pact between the SDLP, Sinn Fein and the Greens not happened,\" she says.\"But I would argue that Alliance cant be written off. We match the DUP in South Belfast in terms of councillors. We both have eight to the SDLPs four, and unofficial figures from Mays council election put us on % in the constituency with the DUP on .% and the SDLP on just .%.\"The Green Party may have stepped aside and endorsed Hanna, but Bradshaw claims that its voters arent listening.\"I havent met a Green supporter yet who is going SDLP, theyre all voting Alliance,\" she says.And she questions just how many Sinn Fein voters will come out for the SDLP. \"Ive found apathy about the election in the Lower Ormeau and the Market,\" she claims.\"There are also a fair few DUP voters telling us theyre disillusioned with the party - that its made a hames out of Brexit and theyre fed up with the scandals. Some are coming over to us, others arent. Theyll just stay at home.\"Voters at two homes in Sicily Park give off to the Belfastabout the DUP - one over Brexit and another over the health service. Three members in the latter household work for the NHS and arent impressed - to put it mildly - with Richard Pengelly, the Department of Health permanent secretary and the DUP candidates husband.Alliance’s Paula Bradshaw talks to a constituent as she canvasses in Newtownbreda\"South Belfast is being very East Belfast in this election,\" says Bradshaw. Normally, its residents are reticent in expressing their preferences, but theyre shooting from the hip this time round.Paula Bradshaw\"Alliance are going great, although we dont really have strongholds. Somewhere like Stranmillis is excellent for us, but theres no place that well come in with % of the vote. Our strength is that we poll solidly across the constituency.\"Bradshaw reports the issues raised on the doorsteps as \"health, no Stormont, Brexit and abortion\"in that order.At one house, a woman praises Alliances stance on equality issues. Shes confused over Brexit. She supported Remain, her husband was a Leaver. She tells Bradshaw shell consider voting for her.But a few doors down, a woman is undecided about how shell vote and says shell wait to see what her husband does. \"Ive heard that at a few doors,\" the Alliance candidate says.Although Bradshaw will poll well, this feels first and foremost like a Hanna-Little-Pengelly fight. The DUP could winthe Remain vote splits evenly, but theres a confidence about the SDLP candidate and her campaign that is unmissable. South Belfast currently seems set toto the party and be represented at Westminster by a new female face."},{"url":null,"title":"general election a chance to maximise remain voices says sdlps eastwood","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

His media performances have been first-class, and this was no exception.Two SDLP advisers accompanied him to the debate, but he didn’t need them. From start to finish he was passionate, polished and professional. He was streets ahead of Michelle O’Neill. While he scored countless points against her, it wasn’t in a destructive way.His most successful moments were when he challenged Sinn Fein on abstentionism from a pragmatic, not ideological, position.He blew away the argument that going to Westminster made no practical dference.Whether we liked it or not, massive decisions were taken there, and MPs had already stopped Brexit several times. “We need to be there fighting against Boris Johnson, locking him out of Downing Street,” Eastwood said.He brushed off claims that this stance was at odds with pulling out of North Belfast for an abstentionist Sinn Fein candidate.“I’d much rather have John Finucane sitting in his house than Nigel Dodds sitting in the House of Commons,” he replied.There was a stinging one-liner to the DUP about how “no amount of Ulster Hall meetings or banging drums” would change things on Brexit. Eastwood’s words will have secured him no friends among unionists. But his eyes are focused on Foyle, and he may well have won over soft Sinn Fein voters with this sparky performance.Emma Little-Pengelly, DUPEmma Little-Pengelly DUP at Sundays UTV Election Debate, moderated by Marc Mallett.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.The word was that Nigel Dodds would stand in for Arlene Foster in this debate but the DUP opted for Emma Little-Pengelly as a substitute.She is fighting to retain her Westminster seat from the SDLP so prime-time media exposure helps.

Her brief was obviously to mention the DUP’s £.bn confidence-and-supply money for Northern Ireland as often as possible. The repetition does get a little tedious. Naomi Long at one stage said the money was “a drop in the ocean” of what was needed to turn around public services here.Little-Pengelly didn’t have answers for some of the criticism her rivals made. On a Brexit plan, the best the DUP can come up with is that a hung Parliament is likely and it will exert its influence againholding the balance of power.Little-Pengelly did handle Steve Aiken’s assertive approach expertly. Her barrister training clearly helps.She came across as moderate and measured, and that will do her no harm in South Belfast.She held up her party’s manesto twice near the end of the debate. That is aimed not at the DUP’s core voters but at the middle-class unionist constituency whom the party wants to win over with its policy detail.Naomi Long, AllianceNaomi Long Alliance at Sundays UTV Election Debate, moderated by Marc Mallett.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.Naomi Long started nervously, and that is not like her. She and Steve Aiken were the only leaders to look at their notes during their opening statements.But from there on the Alliance leader was in top form. She tackled both the DUP and Sinn Fein very successfully several times.There were some stinging one-liners. Long insisted it wasn’t a choice between dealing with health and an Irish Language Act — “we can walk and chew gum at the same time”.In the health discussion, she raised Richard Pengelly, the Department of Health permanent secretary and Little-Pengelly’s husband, which clearly is uncomfortable territory for the DUP.Less successful was Long’s metaphor about Brexit unicorns and donkeys. She has used it too many times and it has lost its appeal.The Alliance leader was totally honest about our NHS crisis, admitting there isn’t “a silver bullet or magic wand”.She was taking no prisoners regarding the DUP and Sinn Fein’s record of government at Stormont. Alliance, the SDLP and UUP sat around the Executive table while the two big parties sat in another room and carved things out between them, she said.Long came across as that rare breed — a straight-talking politician with integrity. This performance strengthens her image as someone who wants to get things done here but is frustrated by the obstinacy of others.Michelle O’Neill, Sinn FeinMichelle ONeill Sinn Fein at Sundays UTV Election Debate, moderated by Marc Mallett.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.This was a typical Michelle O’Neill performance. She didn’t drop the ball, but neither did she run with it and score.Sinn Fein prefers script over spontaneity, and its vice-president stuck to that approach. Tory austerity was a get out-of-jail card whenever her party’s own record was raised.Her best line came when accusing DUP politicians of initial over-excitement about their influence at Westminster. “They’re now sobering up to the reality thatyou’re bought, you can be sold,” she said. The image of a drunk DUP will have raised smiles in a fair few homes. O’Neill’s weakest moment came when she was asked why there was only a single line in Sinn Fein’s manesto about health. “This election is all about Brexit,” she said.Neither had O’Neill answers as to why as Health Minister she didn’t reverse the DUP’s decision to end pay parity for health service workers here. In her favour, she came across as pleasant, and someone who can definitely do business with unionists. She is no bogeywoman..jpg\" title\"Sinn Fein Deputy leader Michelle ONeilland DUP South Belfast Candidate Emma Little-Pengelly during the recording of UTV election debate at the Queens Film studio in Belfast.

Despite a very bitter election campaign, don’t be surprisedthese two parties manage to overcome their dferences on an Irish Language Act and reach a deal that willthem both to power at Stormont.Steve Aiken, UUPSteven Aiken UUP at Sundays UTV Election Debate, moderated by Marc Mallett.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.Steve Aiken went into this debate determined to tackle the DUP, and he did so with gusto. Indeed, with so much gusto that he faced allegations of aggression from Emma Little-Pengelly.There was an awkward moment during the Brexit segment when the DUP candidate tried to cut across the UUP leader. “Wait!,” he said firmly, and put up his hand. A male politician saying that to a female one just doesn’t look good, whatever the intention. It wasn’t helped by Aiken then saying to her: “Don’t tell me I’m wrong!”The UUP is taking an assertive approach towards its DUP rival in this election and that is tactically no bad thing. But the tone of this particular exchange was perhaps not the wisest. The substance of what Aiken said, unlike the delivery, was actually very good.The point that a border down the Irish Sea appeared on the DUP’s watch and “Arlene Foster, Nigel Dodds, Sammy Wilson and you Emma” bear responsibility will hurt the DUP. Although it may not lose that party support, as grassroots unionists seem to blame Boris Johnson alone for the Brexit betrayal. Aiken called for a health emergency to be declared here by London rather than waiting for theof devolution.He pointed out that when the UUP held Stormont’s Health Ministry there were , on our waiting list compared to , now. But his whole performance, unfortunately, just didn’t hang together."},{"url":null,"title":"general election seats to watch wales","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The collaboration between Balenciaga and Nuriev reimagines a sofa — the center of so many homes — as an example of environmentally conscious design, giving generations of garments and other materials another le. The oblong sofa — inspired by typical overstuffed recliners — is upholstered with damaged or otherwise unsellable garments and off-cuts from obsolete stocks of Balenciaga clothing, encased by scrapped transparent vinyl. Patterns, cuts, and tags within the stuffing are recognizably Balenciaga, a mix of past seasons and ideas. Intended to encourage sustainable practices within design and where, the piece reflects Balenciaga’s recognition of the responsibility designers have to counterbalance their environmental impact, and dedication to implementing programs that upcycle waste and contribute to a circular economy.

He was taking part in a commemoration ceremony, organised in memory of Derry man, Robert Boyd, who was executed by firing squad on December , . Boyd was executed for his part in a failed attempt to overthrow King Ferdinand VII of Spain. In his last letter to his brother, William, Boyd wrote: “Mark you that I die like a gentleman and a soldier. I am to be shot with  others in about an hour.” Robert Boyd was  when he died, having participated in General Torrijos’ ill-fated expedition to overthrow King Ferdinand VII of Spain in . googletag.cmd.push Through betrayal by a presumed ally, General Moreno, the expedition failed, and the participants were captured. After a period of incarceration in Malaga, they were, without any semblance of justice, taken out and executed by firing squad. According to historians, In , Spain wrestled with political unrest. Ferdinand VII had been restored to the throne by the British in , on condition that he ruled under the more liberal Constitution of . Unfortunately, Ferdinand reneged on this, preferring an autocratic approach to sovereignty. In , Ferdinand’s misrule provoked a revolt in favour of the  Constitution. Ferdinand was captured but then made promises for reform. However, after his release in , he again reneged on these undertakings and avenged himself against his ‘liberal’ opponents with great ferocity. This repression of those considered to be holding ‘liberal views’ drove many into exile amongst these was Jose Maria de Torrijos and Uriarte . googletag.cmd.push Torrijos sought refuge in England during the s. During his time in England, he attracted a following of like-minded people seeking to defend the cause of liberty and fight against the absolutist and repressive regime of Ferdinand VII. Amongst those followers was Boyd, then a lieutenant in the East India Company’s army.

The SDLP Spokesperson on Agriculture was commenting on the end of the previous UK Government commitment to match the current total level of cash funding for the sector during a transition period.Mr McGlone said: “For the farming sector leaving the EU means leaving the EU funding mechanisms behind as well.“The total allocation of EU funds to Northern Ireland’s farming sector during the period – was €, million, with €, million of that total in Direct Payments to farmers.“For a number of reasons - farms located in Less Favoured Areasand a much higher proportion of cattle and sheep farms - farmers in Northern Ireland receive, on average, higher levels of direct support than farmers in other areas of the UK.“The previous UK Government’s promise to match the total level of cash funding for the farming sector here during a transition period to new support mechanisms ended with the end of that government.There is no guarantee that a new government will renew that commitment.“The UK Agricultural Bill, intending to replace the EU funding mechanisms, failed to make it through parliament before the General Election was called and will have to be reintroduced by any new administration.“In addition, the Agricultural Bill was designed with English farming practices and conditions in mind.The funding provided through the Block Grant will be for the implementation of the rules and regulations it sets out. Any deviation from those regulations would be for a NI Assembly to decide.In the absence of a ing Executive those decisions would be taken by an unaccountable Civil Service.Any additional costs introduced by those decisions will have to be met from the existing Block Grant.“Continuing to maintain current levels of support for the farming sector here after Brexit, with or without a Withdrawal Agreement between the UK and the EU, will therefore result in increasing pressures on the finances of any devolved administration.“That will mean Northern Irish famers competing for resources with health, education and infrastructure in order to match the EU support available to farmers where on this island.“The only way to avoid this future uncertainty is to stop Brexit now.And the only way to stop Brexit is toMPs to Westminster who will vote against Brexit.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In attendance to launch the project was Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service David Sterling, along with members of Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space programme and the local Pathway to Peace initiative headed up by Rev Dr David Latimer.The impressive Peace Pledge Tree is a seven metre high sculpture created by local artist Maurice Harron.He is a highly regarded sculptor who has created iconic pieces including ‘Hands Across the Divide’ at the end of the Craigavon Bridge, ‘The Tinneys’ in Strabane and ‘Celebration’ situated in Creggan.Peace pledges are etched on the leaves of the tree, written by pupils from over  schools across Northern Ireland, and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland. They are written in both English and Irish.One young pupil’s vow reads: “I pledge to express my feelings with patience, not anger or frustration. To be loyal and supportive and avoid selfish choices.”Funding for the tree was provided by The Executive Office.Co-operation Ireland’s ‘Amazing the Space’ project was launched in . The Duke of Sussex Prince Harry attended the event in  and  when the schools who took part reunited to reaffirm their pledges and share their peace building experiences.The tree was designed to be a permanent reminder of the work of the young people.The late deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and former First Minister Arlene Foster were among a number of politicians to publicly support the event, with both parties submitting pledges along with the eleven local councils.Amazing the Space came from an idea by Rev Dr David Latimer and was developed in conjunction with the peace building charity Co-operation Ireland. googletag.cmd.push ‘Peaceful future’  Derry and Strabane Mayor, Michaela Boyle described it as a “truly innovative project” that brings together young people from across the island of Ireland to express their personal aspirations for a peaceful future.“This stunning creative piece of public art is a powerful expression of optimism and hope for a positive and peaceful future. I am delighted that it will be located at Ebrington for future generations to enjoy.“I would like to acknowledge the role played by all the young people involved in Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space project and the role they played in bringing forward fresh ideas with an open mind and a positive energy. “The work that is being done at a local and global level is very important to sustain and build a peaceful future for everyone,” she added.The Head of the NI Civil Service, Mr David Sterling, believes the ‘Peace Tree’ is a fitting legacy of the Amazing the Space programme. He said: “The tree forms part of the Pathway to Peace reaching from the Guildhall, across the Peace Bridge and ending at the Peace Pledge Tree, here at Ebrington.“This is a shared space for everyone from across Northern Ireland and beyond. I have no doubt that the pledges made by over  pupils will be read and enjoyed by many.”Meanwhile, Co-operation Ireland CEO Peter Sheridan said: “Amazing the Space was designed to allow young people to have their say in the promotion and development of a peaceful society in Northern Ireland and we in Co-operation Ireland are delighted that the effort put in by young people since  will have a permanent tribute here in the city where the project was first established.”Reverend Dr David Latimer declared it the “most exciting” peace initiative he’s been involved with and an enjoyable partnership with schools across the nine Counties of Ulster, since .He continued: “Young people, wherever they’re living, hope for a world free of poverty, inequality and exploitation. They want a world free of discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, creed, language and gender.“Our young people, with their vibrant ideas and clear perspectives, can reveal a better path. Their words and wisdom, displayed within The Peace Tree, can be a Beacon of Hope that will inspire many to turn their dreams of peace to reality.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Indeed, it is fair to say that our group have been strong supporters of the initiative long before many of the current UU administration ever heard of it. Unfortunately, our city-region has so focused its attentions on this new school – which,UU ever gets its necessary permissions and finance, will have  students by  – that we have completely lost sight of the much bigger picture. Higher Education provision North West is at a catastrophically low level, it has been this way for  years, and our failure to address this crisis is resulting in lasting generational damage. googletag.cmd.push Moreover, the minimal university provision that is located here is controlled and taxed by Belfast and of no economic benefit to our region. Things have gotten so bad that our own Council was recently caught inflating student numbers on a trade mission in a bid to put a gloss on a very bad picture. UU, meanwhile, have spent the past decade playing a bizarre game of push-halfpenny, moving courses in and out of Magee in rapid succession in a bid to create the faccedilade of expansion. But the figures published by the Derry News last month show their manoeuvring to be nothing but a cynical exercise – we had fewer than  full-time university students in  and we still have fewer than  today. googletag.cmd.push And forget any meaningful UU expansion over the next  years. After spending, and borrowing, poundm-plus for the new white elephant campus in North Belfast, there is no money left for Derry. Not a doily. UU will predictably move a few le sciences courses here from Coleraine, for the short-term, to support their case for the medical school. Expect an announcement on this in the New Year to take the heat off the fact that the medical school is in limbo. But what they won’t mention is that within the last few years they emptied the campus of Psychology and Sociology courses – to the tune of  students. Now they’ve discovered they need numbers back in Derry. But what will be the next to go when our backs are turned  God knows, the priority is to fill Belfast at all costs. They even had the temerity to remove INCORE, an institution developed and rooted in the North West. So don’t ever think anything is sacred – and particularly not the new medical school.   A three-line business case As campaigners we are often challenged by well-meaning supporters and patronising critics to put our money where our mouth is and produce a business case for a new university. And in our previous incarnation we did that, wasting tens of thousands of pounds, and several years, preparing a meticulousproposal that politicians, civil servants and UU blithely ignored in favour of a series of empty promises from each other. Let’s not mince words, the business case is blindingly obvious – and anyone asking for it is really just asking to stall. It can be delivered in just three lines: a The North West has some of the worst social indices on these islands as regards health, education and employment, and our need for HE provision has been established since . b A standalone university of , students, delivering accredited courses from the National University of Ireland’s ten facultiesbefore research earnings are taken into account. On top of this, each student will then spend somewhere between pound and pound to the North West economy per year, bringing in additional annual revenue of between poundm and poundm to the region. c If we don’t move immediately on a standalone university, orwe sit back and expect delivery from UU, Stormont and the NI Civil Service – all of which have failed us and bled our city-region dry for decades – we will inflict decades more of poverty and emigration on the generations to come. We can’t NOT do this. The dficulty is not and has never been, the business case. The dficulty is political will and fear thatwe ‘rock the boat’ we will get nothing. It shows the poverty of ambition in the North West that the election debate in Foyle has been dominated by discussion over who will get credit for a -seat faculty we were first promised almost two decades ago. Every single one of our representatives, political or civil, is too frightened to speak out and demand the wholesale changes we need in case they get blamed for delaying the medical school. It is nothing less than Stockholm Syndrome. It is aswe have talked so long without response about how shockingly discriminatory the situation is, and has always been, that we doubt our own case. Despite that, there is huge support from outside the region from those who can see clearly that the North West’s claim to have its own university is unassailable. Local government in the North West, in partnership with civic society, must take responsibility for the development and scrutiny of all existing and future university development. We cannot allow others, whose interests are not those of the North West, to take the lead. It is reckless of us not to look where for university partners. We are putting the futures of our children at risk. We have American partners, Irish partners and British partners who are interested now in helping us develop a standalone institution. It is time to pull them together and build. We have been led by the nose for too long. Our new MP to be elected this week has a big job ahead of her him. If Derry is to undergo the revival it needs, s he must start by demonstrating the political will to deliver us the new university we deserve. Next week talks will begin to re-establish Stormont. Again, our agenda should be blindingly obvious here. Except, this time, it can be summed up in one line:you want us to have faith in the Belfast institutions, build us a standalone, regional university that puts an end to a century of discrimination respects and reflects our Irish, British and European identity and marks the beginning of a new equal society in northwest Ireland.

It also contains contact and other information on all of the Diocese’s  parishes across Derry, Donegal and Tyrone. “The aim is to communicate effectively with all of those currently active in parishes as well to encourage those who want to reconnect with their faith or enquire about their local parish.”The Derry priest noted that one of the key themes of the Diocesan Pastoral Plan is: ’To Make Jesus Known and Loved.’ He continued: “As well as the new website being a reference point for information about parishes, priests and organisations, it seeks to be a tool for evangelisation. Events that are happening around the diocese will be publicised, and good news stories shared and the faith of the people of the Diocese will be nourished.“People will be able to find details of upcoming events at parish and diocesan level Mass times, details of clergy, and ious organisations at work within the diocese and across Ireland that are associated with the Catholic Church. “People will also be able to stay up to date with the Diocesan Pastoral Plan as the Diocese works towards the Diocesan Assembly in .“The website also has links to external sites where people can find out more about their faith and what we believe and why. We look forward to people looking at the website and giving us their feedback.” In tandem with the new website, the Derry Diocese has also developed another online page, dedicated solely to the development of Vocations for men and women. www.derryvocations.orgcan be accessed directly from diocesan website, and also as an independent domain.Fr Chris Ferguson, director of vocations, said an important part of the Diocesan Pastoral Plan is highlighting the importance of vocation. He added: “As Christians, we believe every person has received a personal calling from God, which we are asked to respond to throughout our lives. “In Baptism, every person is welcomed into the community of God’s people. We all have a part to play in Jesus’ mission to bring healing and mercy. “ In a desire to create a culture of vocations, the vocations website is designed to help people question and celebrate their calling in le. The website has been created to provide information and support to those seeking to discover who God is calling them to be, and what path in le might bring them true contentment and happiness.Both websites are now live and can be accessed at www.derrydiocese.org and www.derryvocations.org googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Whats worse is that you have to spend the next  mins scraping your car with a credit card and waiting for the ice to clear! Now youre late for work and stressed! Having an ice scraper and de-icer in the car will save you so much time. Youll arrive at work on time, far more calm and collected and you wont need to order a new credit card! Fully charged mobile phoneIts even more important to have your mobile charged when youre driving in winter so that you can reach out for helpyou need it and also be contacted yourself. If your car has a USB charger then keep a mobile charger lead in the car so you can charge your phone as you go. If your car isnt that fancy then there are lots of gadgets on the market that will do the same usually using the cigarette lighter as the charging point. If youre a member of a breakdown service then have their number to hand. You usually receive a card to keep in your wallet when you sign up as well as a members booklet that you can keep in the car. googletag.cmd.push Warm clothingStuck on the M, a truck has broken down and you dont want to keep the car running while youre sat in traffic because youre a little low on petrol. Brrrr. If only youd packed your down jacket, fleece, hat and scarf, youd be so toasty right now ! Keep a bag of warm clothing items in your car during winter. You just never know. Blanket or travel rugAnother useful item to keep you warm and comfortableyou get stuck in cold weather. It could come in really usefulyoure travelling with children or the elderly. googletag.cmd.push Food and snacksThe glove compartment is a good place to keep some snacks to keep energy levels up and blood sugars in check. Protein cereal bars are a good choice and easy to store. A couple of chocolate bars and some bottles of water will stand you in good steadyou find yourself not moving. Hi-vis clothingIf you do have to get out of the car either to wait for help or perhaps clear snow, you need to be seen. With less daylight hours in winter it can get pretty dark quite quickly in the evenings so a hi vis jacket or vest will mean youll wont be missed by other drivers. Snow shovel and a broomAnother piece of kit youre going to be so grateful for when you wake up in the morning and theres been heavy snowfall during the night. At home or away a snow shovel and broom will come in really handy to clear your path and get you on your way. Our telescopic snow shovel is an ideal space saving item to pack. De-icing saltSalt to throw on the ground will really help speed up the process to get all that snow out the way and you on the road.Snow chains or snow socks for your tyresIf the weather really takes a turn for the worse then snow chains or socks for your tyres will help keep you moving in snow or icy conditions. They will help increase your grip on snow and ice to allow you to get to cleared roads. You can use our helpful tool to find the right snow chains for your car here and its a good idea to practice putting them on and removing them. You can always pop in-store and we can advise you! Study boots and a set of ice gripsWhen theres snow to be cleared and ice to be scraped, a pair of flip flops isnt going to cover it. Have a strong pair of boots to hand and you wont be slipping and sliding around. Plus, youre feet will stay nice and warm! Emergency warning triangleIf your car does breakdown then an emergency warning triangle placed  metresbehind your broken-down vehicle on the same side of the road will alert other vehicles that youre ahead. Be careful when youre retrieving it. Tow ropeHaving a tow rope in the car during winter can get you out of some tricky situations whether your car needs to be towed after a breakdown or another driver needs some help. Jump leadsJump leads are useful to have in the boot of your car all year around but particularly in winter when your battery might start to complain during the winter months. Tyre inflatorWith all those nasty conditions, the roads can take a bit of a bashing in winter, which can mean an increased risk of you getting a puncture. If the tyre isnt completely blown then having a tyre inflator will mean you can add some enough air to get you to your destination. First aid kitA just in case item because you never know what the winter weather is going to throw at you. Halfords sell dferent kits from basic to a full pc set. Its a good idea to have a First aid kit in your car at all times during the year. TorchPack a sturdy torch for winter driving.

A team of Ulster Bank branch managers completed litter pick on the banks of the River Foyle, close to the mouth of the old Strabane Canal. Local director, Chris McGuiness, said “even though the amount of plastic waste was shocking this was an enjoyable and very worthwhile activity for our team. “We would definitely be interested in doing of this sort of environmental activity in the future.” Finally, a group of volunteers from Seagate took part in bank downstream of Strabane Canal. The volunteers could not believe how much plastic waste had accumulated in such a beautul location. Close to  bags of rubbish were removed.

Ardmore Folk Group are planning One City One Voice in the hopes that singing together can build strong and lasting peace in Derry.The first Sing for Peace event was held in May after the murder of journalist Lyra McKee when more than , people sang in unison to show that the city is not defined by the violent acts of a small number of iniduals. Dr Nicola Herron, one of the events organisers said: No one really knew what to do after the murder so we organised a sing along and it was really beautul and healing for a lot of people. It brought people back together again and let us get that message across that the people of Derry want peace. Nicola is urging everyone to take part in this weeks event, regardless of singing ability, in the hopes that the singing will be heard far and wide and that it will continue the peace movement during this festive period. The medic says that they have chosen songs that everyone will know to get as many people joining in as possible. Every little voice makes our one big voice stronger, is the message for the event so Nicola is encouraging schools, choirs, youth groups and iniduals to come along on the night. The songs can be found at Christmas Sing for Peace on Facebook and singers are asked to bring their own wordsthey are needed.Violence is a part of our past, not our present - and it certainly wont be a part of our future, and events like these really get that message across, Dr Herron said.The sing-along takes place on Wednesday December , starting in the Guildhall at pm before walking to the Peace Garden on Foyle Street, singing a song on the Peace Bridge and finishing up at the Peace Tree in Ebrington at pm - weather permitting. Anybody taking part is encouraged to wrap up warm and bring LED lights and lanterns with them to light the way. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Those in support of the new development are confident that it will have a positive impact and also deter anti-social behaviour in the area.The amended plans which were lodged last week are seeking approval for a garage canopy and totem-style signage.And while the development will result in the loss of some existing open space, those behind the new filling station proposal insist that the benefits will ldquodecisively outweigh the loss, arguing that there is an abundance of existing open space and proposed amenity space at this part of the town.It is estimated that there are currently over  people employed at the Ballymote shopping centre site which is home to a number of businesses and community organisations.A petrol station located a short distance away at St Patrickrsquos Drive closed sometime ago, with people in the wider Lecale area having to make their way through Downpatrick town centre to access other filling stations.The Ballymote Community Project has described support for the planned petrol station as ldquosolid and has outlined plans for CCTV cameras to be mounted around the station and on the canopy. There are also plans to provide additional parking as part of the proposed development.The Community Project has previously argued that the new garage will help complete the ldquocarefully planned range of services at Ballymote and will ldquoprotect this unique community business from larger external supermarket interests buying land locally and trying to compete.In his submission to planners last April, Sean Kennedy of Nicholl Fuel Oils, explained that the retail fuel market in Northern Ireland is ldquorapidly moving to unmanned sites.He said the proposed Ballymote development will help the company grow its unmanned network and bring a ldquonew and necessary service to the local community.Mr Kennedy said the proposed filling station will also safeguard the future of the Ballymote Centre and the jobs it already provides..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Emma.jpg","title":"Emma’s teddy bears on Kirsty Allsopp’s Handmade Christmas show  ","story":"A WOMANrsquoS love of crafting landed her a spot as a maker of traditional teddy bears on TV presenter Kirsty Allsopprsquos annual celebration of handcrafted Christmas decorations and treats.Emma Phillips from Ballynahinch took part in the handmade toy competition in Kirstyrsquos Handmade Christmas series on Channel .While the mother of four sons did not win on last Fridayrsquos show mdash the honour went to the maker of a crochet knit reindeer toy mdash she did showcase her fantastic skills to a national audience.The fully jointed bear was made in just four hours and caught the eye of the presenter also known for Location, Location, Location and Kirsty and Philrsquos Love It or List It.Emma said that she was delighted to be asked to take part in the show after being one of thousands of crafters who applied to take part.ldquoIt was really all about taking part and I just glad to have been able to get through to the competition as it was just amazing, said EmmaldquoThe amount of skilled crafters that were there at Kirstyrsquos house, which is massive and absolutely amazing, were really impressive. There were people from all over the UK so I did have stf competition.Emma said that she was encouraged by friends and fellow local crafters to apply for the show as shersquos well-known the crafting circles.ldquoThe show was advertised in July and I got a call in August by researchers to find out more about what I did as I put through a couple of ideas of things that I made but it was the teddy bears that they were interested in.ldquoOnce I knew I was selected a TV crew came out to my studio in Spa to film me in September and it was a bit strange to ask my husband to get the Christmas lights outldquoIn early October I flew out to to go to Kirstyrsquos house Meadowgate in Devon where two weeks of filming took place. There were  episodes of the programme and four crafters competed every day. On the day we were being filmed, there were four competitions going on.Emma only started making the handmade bears two Christmases. She also makes a range of felted toys, such as personalised dolls and knits in merino wool.ldquoIrsquom self taught with the teddy bears, explained Emma. ldquoI just wanted to make a jointed bear so I ordered a kit online and went from there. I have been making and experimenting with them ever since.ldquoI have been doing a lot of crafting over the last year and selling at local artisan markets and hopefully I will be able to concentrated on making the bears from next year.The -inch felted mohair bear was a real hit with Kirsty who was fascinated at how Emma used a small blow torch to singe the wool to make it look authentically old. However, she added that she felt under pressure to have it made in the time allowed.ldquoThe only thing I was allowed to do beforehand was to draw my pattern out and everything  had to be done within the four hours allowed, she said. ldquoNormally I would take six to eight hours to make a bear but I had to plan everything out really well for the show. I had never done one that quick before and on the day I was hoping that I would be able to get it finished.Emma said that she got her love of crafting from her grandmother, Violet Spence, who still competes as a member of Drumbo Womenrsquos Institute, and her mother, Linda Davies, who kept the tradition going.Emma can be contacted on Facebook and Instagram as Emma Phillips Handmade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 4%2C 1979  ","story":"STRIKE mdash The bin strike in Down District has ended and normal bin collections have resumed. The four-day strike, which is believed to have been caused by overtime demands, was settled by a meeting of union officials and council administrators.After the meeting the council works manager, Mr Jim Mitchell, issued a short statement which said: ldquoThe strike is over, we will start back in the morning.Council officials refused to discuss what began the strike and they did not say whether overtime demands were met.The strike began on the day when manual workers in all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district councils were offered a  per cent pay rise, which could mean a hefty increase in local rates.A senior official of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union travelled from Belfast to the council offices in Downpatrick and agreement was reached within a matter of hours.The unions have agreed to negotiate on the offer without committing themselves to accepting that  per cent is the final offer.KILLYLEAGH mdash The battle to remove parking control zones from Killyleagh town centre is hotting up. The Secretary of State, Mr Humphrey Atkins, at the request of the South Down MP, Mr Enoch Powell, is looking into the question of relaxing regulations, it was revealed at the local Town Committeersquos monthly meeting.The Town Committee drew up a petition last month calling for the removal of the controls because they felt they were unnecessary and crippling businesses. Every trader in the town signed the petition.At their last meeting committee members agreed to ask Mr Powell to take up the fright. He did, saying he would be ldquostrongly supporting their request.The Committeersquos decision to go above the heads of local polio and take up the issue with the Northern Ireland Office seems to have worked as well.It is believed the Secretary of State has already been in contact with local police, but everyone is keeping tight-lipped about the request.The latest developments in Killyleagh are being closely watched by traders in other towns and villages in the area, especially Saintfield where traders were told by police  months ago that the ban on unattended parking could not be lted.CASTLEWELLAN mdash A local councillor has condemned a weekend bomb attack in Castlewellan and claimed it is part of a concerted attempt to drive true minority Protestant community from the town.The claim was made by Mrs Ethel Smyth at a meeting of Down Council and she said she was concerned that attempts are still being made against the Protestant community in Castlewellan.ldquoIt has a more sinister motive than just the destruction of property, she said. ldquoIt is an all-out effort to intimidate and terrorise these people to make them leave the area.Mrs Smyth said councillors should join together and give encouragement to minority groups to stand fast. She felt Roman Catholics and Protestants wished nothing more than to live their lives in peace and harmony and she called on the RUC and British Army to apprehend ldquothese evil men.But Mrs Smyth did not receive full backing from fellow Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted to be partly associated with her remarks and he agreed it was heartbreaking when someone who is bombed is subjected to more bombing.He pointed out that in the Castlewellan area it was not Protestants alone who had suffered and that Roman Catholics had been targets for the bombers. Mr OrsquoNeill concluded by urging councillors to address the problem in a non-sectarian way.But Mrs Smyth persisted and said the facts would bear out that it was the Protestant section of the community which had suffered.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinchrsquos new pound, Christmas illuminations will be officially switched on by Downtown Radio DJ Hendi at a special ceremony in the Square on Friday evening.Hendi will switch on the Christmas tree lights at .pm, while the  new Christmas lanterns, situated all over the townrsquos shopping areas, will be going on earlier, along with the street lighting.The switch-on promises to be quite an occasion, with Ballynahinch Silver Band in attendance, while a choir from Assumption Grammar, Ballynahinch High and St Colmanrsquos High Schools will provide a programme of Christmas carols.The nightrsquos activities will being to a climax all true plans drawn up by the forward-thinking Chamber of Commerce, whose idea to provide the town with Christmas illuminations looked a far-off dream at one stage.However, thanks to the generosity of the majority of the traders, a grant from Down Council and a share of the Swimming Pool Project Fund, the idea is now a reality. The pound, illuminations were erected by Mr Sean Murnin and his son, Paul.ARDGLASS mdash One womanrsquos battle to collect enough money for two kidney machines took a giant step forward in Ardglass this week.She is Mrs Winnie Cully, of Portavogie, and she was in Ardglass to collect two cheques totalling almost pound from fishermen, fish salesmen and friends in the port.The first cheque for pound came from the skippers of  Ardglass fishing boats and was handed over by Mr James Smyth, while the second cheque for pound was from six fish salesmen and three friends.

The speed of the attack had caught Olympic flat-footed at the back and Ireland, with the goal at his mercy, unselfishly squared the ball to Kyle Morris in a better position.Alas, Morrisrsquo effort went the aerial route and went over the top, via the crossbar mdash a costly miss.Rovers continued to dominate proceedings, but then shot themselves in the foot after  minutes. They dithered at the back when asked to clear a Jack Roddy free kick and the predatory Aaron McCaffrey was on hand to steer Olympic into the lead.Ireland tried to get Rovers going again, but he was continually thwarted by Niall McGlew and Reece McConnell, but they wouldnrsquot keep the dangerman quiet for too much longer.With  minutes played Harrison spread a delightful pass out to Daniel Sloan. He immediately surged into the box and put the ball a plate for Ireland to make it -.Seven minutes later Ireland latched on to a long clearance from Ronan McDowell, but was off target and just before the break Conor Sloan headed an Ireland corner wide from a great position.The second half was barely  seconds old when Olympic regained the lead. Man of the match Lyons found room out on the left flank, left two defenders for dead and drilled a low effort past McDowell to make it -. Olympic now had the bit between their teeth and Lyons had two more efforts go close, one saved and the other went wide.However, with  minutes gone an under siege Rovers countered and Morris did the spadework before Ireland made it -.Seven minutes later Lyons scored from close range after McCaffrey had created the opening as Olympic again struck on the break, but their joy was short lived.With  minutes gone a searing run down the right flank by Ireland saw him cross for Daniel Sloan to make it -.It was anybodyrsquos game at this stage, but Olympic seized the moment and seven minutes later John Fennell popped up in the box, when least expected, to beat McDowell all ends up with a clinical finish.Olympic know how to close a game out and did so superbly to cement their place in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final for the third year in succession.Ballynahinch Olympic: John McMenamin, Jack Roddy, Daryl Russell, Reece McConnell, Niall McGlew, Simon Marmion, Shane Rodgers, Thomas Rodgers, Aaron McCaffrey, Darren Lyons, Josh Fennell.

A dangerous Nathan Jones cross was cleared and from Olympicrsquos second corner, taken by Anton McGrattan, Jason Noade headed straight at the lsquokeeper.At the other end Jake Kerr fired over the bar and after a good passing move, Thomas Morrison fired into the side netting.However, the early breakthrough, in the th minute, came from Olympic. A deep corner was headed back to Paul Dickson whose shot was blocked and the ball came out to Molloy who fired a low shot to the net from inside the box.Shankill hit back and were convinced they should have been awarded a penalty when Shane Murray tackled dangerman Curtis Black in the box, but referee Nathan McLean let play continue.Shankill manager Davy McAlinden received a caution and Tre Sterling was also in trouble with the match official for a tackle on Ryan Noade.A dangerous Jones corner had to be tipped away as it glided towards the angle of bar and post, but although Olympic were playing well, the Shankill threat was ever-present and when Jake Kerr played in Kyle Dillon, lsquokeeper Ryan Walsh made a great stop from a close range shot.Olympic had a great chance to increase their lead two minutes into the second half when Jones slipped a neat pass to Mason, who had found space in front of goal, but he couldnrsquot beat Andrew Dillon.Shankill breathed a sigh of relief, went on the attack and as Olympic switched off, they equalised.Sterling crossed to the back post and Luke Briers beat Walsh to loop a header to the net.Two more Shankill names went into the refereersquos notebook as Olympic exerted pressure from midfield.

The process involved engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.Kevin Quigley, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Harbour Authority, said an investigation into the sinking would now be carried out by the Irish maritime organisation, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.He added: ldquoThis was a very impressive operation to raise the Dillon Owen and it seemed to carried out very efficiently and safely.ldquoThere was no local pollution problems from the sinking of the boat.The trawler got into dficulty on October  as it headed towardsArdglass harbour, with a rescue operation mounted by Newcastle and Portaferry RNLI volunteer crews who responded to a Mayday call in the early hours.The local crews worked alongside Irish Coastguardrsquos Rescue  helicopter after the call for help was made at .am.The boat got into dficulty as it tried to dock to offload its catch in poor weather.It was listing badly and had started to take on water when the leboats arrived, helping the five crew members to safety with the help of the coastguard.While the vessel did not sink the day after it ran aground, it subsequently succumbed to the water afew days later due to further bad weather.The Cork-registered vessel is believed to have been badly damaged with its catch of mackerel lost, with most of it enjoyed by gulls and other sea birds.Since the incident, a massive barge twice visited Ardglass harbour over recent weeks to carry out the necessary preparation to raise the boat, but bad weather prevented an earlier attempt to raise it.The barge arrived back last Friday to carry out further work ahead of a window of calm weather to allow the trawler to be raised.Councillor Dermot Curran said that the earlier arrival of the barge made for interesting viewing for Ardglass people.ldquoWhen the barge was lit up at night, it was a quite a spectacle to see it twinkling in the harbour.

It is also hoped that more volunteers will give up some of their spare time to help run the new centre which has opened to wide acclaim.In the latest edition of Saintfield News, Development Association chairman Martyn Todd said a number of people have already made suggestions about how best to utilise available space in a number of other buildings at the Belfast Road site.He said the group, alongside the Saintfield Community Trust which is running the new facility, are seeking a meeting with Rowallane councillors and local council officials to discuss options for these remaining areas.Mr Todd said options would need to complement the community activities already on the site and confirmed that there would again be consultation with local people before final decisions are made.He said that since the centre was handed over to the people of Saintfield, it has gone from strength to strength.ldquoThe centre is managed by the Saintfield Community Trust and is run by a small group of volunteers. This means that having the centre open all day, every day is not practical as the staff to oversee s and meetings are just not available, said Mr Todd.ldquoIt is very satisfying to note, however, that at the end of October there has been over  hours of use across the site. The G pitch is now booked every week night and offers users a great opportunity to show off their skills indoors. It has become a training hub for Darragh Cross GAC, Saintfield United Football Club and Carryduff Colts.Mr Todd also confirmed that casual user groups are already making the most of the facility on their doorstep, with the unpredictable summer weather making the indoor pitch the ideal location for Saintfieldrsquos two primary schools to hold their end of year sports days.He continued: ldquoThe hall, studio and meeting room have been a big hit with user groups, providing a wide range of clubs, services and activities. From the outset, the aim for the end of the first year of operation was to attract user groups catering for a wide range of activities and age groups.ldquoThis has already been achieved in the first five months of operation and the centre is well ahead of projections. This early success is a testament to the hard work of the Saintfield Community Trust who oversee the centre, as well as the volunteers who keep it running.Mr Brian Gamble, the editor of Saintfield News, is also backing calls for local people to come forward to help run the new centre.He recalled that the late Gerry Lowe, former chairman of Saintfield Town Regeneration Committee, which was the Development Associationrsquos predecessor, was a key player in the push for a new community centre but sadly did not live to see his vision realised.ldquoThe new centre was handed over to the Saintfield Community Trust to run as a shared space to cater for the sporting and social needs of all the people of Saintfield and district, continued Mr Gamble.ldquoThe centre usage is growing rapidly and is already ahead of projections. There is a small group of people helping out with the ious duties, although more assistance is needed.Mr Gamble hopes that some people in the Saintfield area who care about the village and its residents will come forward and offer a few hours each month to support the operation of the new centre or by serving on one of the Development Associationrsquos committees .He added: ldquoYou donrsquot need any special skills and you will also benefit by making new friends and doing your bit for the community.Anyone who can spare an hour or two per week and would like to become involved in supporting the community is asked to email either reception, saintfieldcc@gmail or editor@discoverssaintfield.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Call.jpg","title":"Support for Down GAA centre of excellence  ","story":"ELECTED representatives are being urged to support plans for a multi-million pound investment in an ultra-modern GAA sports centre in Ballykinlar.Down GAArsquos proposed facility will include four floodlit pitches mdash including the current pitch owned by Ballykinlar GAC mdash and will also feature changing facilities for players and officials, and a multi-use sports area.Other key features of the development which will be financed via a cocktail of funding, include spectator seating for , fans at one of the new pitches which it is hoped will in futurehost club championship games.Plans have also been unveiled for a fitness studio and floodlit walking trail around the new development covering just over  acres of land.South Down SDLP Westminster election candidate Michael Savage mdash who has met with Down GAA chairman Sean Rooney mdash wants all politicians to support the planned investment.Mr Savage said that for too long, many members of Down GAA have been without a dedicated and specialist training facility in the county.

John Eaton named his sons after his favourite books in the Bible. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Although John Eaton died two months before his son’s birth, Margaret Craig continued the tradition by naming him Timothy. She also ensured that all her sons were firmly grounded in the Presbyterian catechism and thoroughly familiar with the Scriptures through daily Bible readings.Timothy served his time as an apprentice shopkeeper in nearby Portglenone. He slept under the store’s counter which was convenient because he had to work from early morning to late at night six days a week. During his apprenticeship, he learned much about the business of buying and selling and that the honesty taught him by his mother was the best policy for a merchant. In addition, he learned empathy for all who worked long hours for little reward. When his apprenticeship expired, he received only one hundred pounds sterling for five years’ work.Aged , Eaton emigrated to Canada to join other family members already established in southern Ontario.At the age of  Eaton encountered a Methodist minister engaged in open-air preaching. He withdrew to a barn to ‘debate with [himself] and seek the assistance of God in solitary prayer’.On histo the meeting, he made a confession of faith and soon joined the Methodist Church. By doing so, he was following in the footsteps of two of his brothers. He met Margaret Wilson Beattie while attending St Mary’s Methodist Church. Within weeks he had proposed, and they were married on May  . They had five sons and three daughters. In  Eaton set up a bakery in the town of Kirkton, Ontario, which failed after only a few months. Undismayed, he opened a dry goods storein St Mary, Ontario.

Its arrival became a major event in thousands of small towns and remote rural communities across Canada. Eaton’s catalogue enabled them to acquire a wide array of products previously not easily attainable in such communities, ranging from clothes and furniture to the latest household gadgets and milking machines.The mail order catalogue spawned a retail empire which would stretch from coast to coast, reaching its apogee during the Second World War when T Eaton Co Limited would employ a staff of more than , people. Although strictly speaking Timothy Eaton did not invent the department store, nor was he the first retailer in the world to implement a money-back guarantee, the chain he founded popularised both concepts and revolutionised retailing in Canada.Although hostile to trade unions, Eaton was still a benevolent employer. In part a legacy of his memories of the long hours that he had worked in Portglenone as a young man, he was a pioneer of the early closing movement, incrementally reducing theof the working day. By January  the store closed daily at pm and beginning in  employees enjoyed a half holiday on Saturdays during the summer months. In the s he introduced a rudimentary medical plan for employees.Despite his fame, the retiring Eaton preferred to remain in the background. He never became a public figure, and he refused to enter politics. He had three principal interests: Methodism, his family, and his store.On January ,  Eaton died of pneumonia and was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto. At the time of his death he employed over , people in his Toronto and Winnipeg stores, in factories in Toronto and Oshawa and in offices in London and Paris. Having once told John A MacDonald, the first Canadian prime minister, that his original assets were ‘a we, five children and seven dollars’, he left an estate worth ,,. In , Eaton’s we learned that Toronto Methodists were trying to raise money to build the first great Methodist church in the northern part of the city. She offered to donate all the money they needed to build one of the handsomest churches in the city subject to one proviso: that the church be named after her husband. The Timothy Eaton Memorial Church, on Toronto’s St Clair Avenue, was completed in . Eaton is memoralised in other ways too. The town of Eatonia in Saskatchewan is also named after him, as is Eaton Park, the ground of Ballymena Rugby Football Club.try catch  TrendingInappropriate content, staff members personal information and threatening messages -

It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said when it happens it will be down to the millions who stood up against what ldquohas been happening in society.Mr McDonnell said peoplersquos potential is being wasted in too many parts of the country, adding: ldquoGood jobs and whole industries that were once the pride of our country have been lost and replaced with dreary, exploitative, insecure and low-paid jobs, or in some cases no jobs at all. Itrsquos no wonder people feel disillusioned in politicians and politics.ldquoAs our manesto makes clear, turning these two things around will be our number one priority in government.He said a National Transformation Unit will be set up immediately, providing the initial finance for a new National Investment Bank, regional development banks and Post Bank.ldquoWersquove already started our meetings with the Treasury officials, they are working up plans and getting ready to implement this as soon as we go into power on Friday morning, Mr McDonnell said.He added: ldquoWersquore creating new institutions ndash institutions that will become the normal part of peoplersquos lives, like the NHS. Institutions that we will come to cherish and rely upon, like the NHS. And, like the NHS, institutions that will only be set up under a Labour government.ldquoCentral among those institutions will be publicly owned and democratically run utilities, because when Labour put money in your pockets, we will also put power back in your hands. -- vw,vw,px, px\" --Mr McDonnell said: ldquoThanks to privatisation and outsourcing and offshoring and similar initiatives pursued by the Thatcher government and Conservative governments since in the name of market efficiency, more and more aspects of our lives are shaped by remote corporate interests over which we have little or no control.ldquoSo the second key priority for me and a Labour government will be to change that.He added: ldquoIn our first  days we will start the processes of bringing water and energy into public ownership. Wersquoll set up boards to run these utilities made up of you, the customer, and you the people, the workers, as well as representatives from local councils, metro mayors and others.ldquoWersquoll make sure that decisions are taken locally by those who understand the services ndash those who use them and those who deliver them.In his speech, Mr McDonnell also made reference to ldquoattacks on his party, saying: ldquoThere will always be those at the top who will do anything to stop us ndash and wersquove seen it, character assassinations, lies and smears taken I believe to a new level in British politics.ldquoThe more people we convince on the doorstep, the more they ramp up their attacks because those whorsquove had it good for so long are terried, terried of losing control.ldquoAnd when they attack me, or Jeremy, we know itrsquos not really about us.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
