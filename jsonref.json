You might be preparing for a trip this weekend yourself, but there was no pushing through crowds with a suitcase full of presents to catch a train for Her Majesty! Instead she looked as perfectly put together as ever in a cosy camel coat and one of her signature printed headscarves. She\u0026#39s got styles by Hermès in her collection, but this one is distinctively a Burberry design. If the check print wasn\u0026#39t enough of a giveaway, the little detail you can just see in the middle is the British brand\u0026#39s logo.

Well done\u0027.The decision by the Queen to miss her speech is just one of the quirky goings on at the Norfolk estate that newcomer the Duchess of Sussex will have to get used to.She will find her Christmas with the royal family unlike anything she has experienced, according to Princess Diana\u0027s former butler. From the moment she wakes up the entire day will run like clockwork with lunch, drinks and even party games timed to perfection.And while Meghan is likely to find the occasion overwhelming Princess Diana\u0027s \u0027rock\u0027 said she could do no worse than join in the fun at the Sandringham estate – but risk missing the Queen\u0027s televised speech at her peril.          Burrell, who served as a footman to the Queen and butler to Diana for a total of 21 years, described the royal family Christmas as \u0027intense but family fun\u0027Burrell said: \u0027The Queen especially loves Christmas because she has her entire family under one roof. She wants to do things with the family, but she still does her boxes, even on Christmas Day. She always puts work before pleasure.\u0027While there are said to be tension between Meghan and the Duchess of Cambridge they are unlikely to surface as they sit round the table for Christmas lunch.Family attendance the event is mandatory with Burrell saying all family members are expected to attend.\u0027The Queen uses a three-line whip. You\u0027re invited, you don\u0027t refuse, you don\u0027t ever turn the Queen down, said Burrell.The seating plan for the lunch will have been carefully though out and any ill feeling among family members will be expected to be put aside and engage in polite small talk. \u0027Even on Christmas Day, it\u0027s all timed. You can\u0027t say you \u0027feel woozy, let\u0027s have dinner later\u0027, he said.\u0027You have to sit next to someone you\u0027ve not sat next to before, making polite conversation. There\u0027s no opting out.\u0027I\u0027ve never seen any member of the Royal Family totally drunk and being helped to bed, but certainly I\u0027ve seen them merry - and Christmas is that time.    The Duchess of Sussex should prepare herself for an intense four days at the Sandringham estate, which will be \u0027occupied by some of the biggest personalities and egos in the country\u0027, says Burrell           Burrell explains  the festive period has always been used by the royal members to curry favor with the monarch and Meghan should seize the opportunity to talk to Her Majesty. Above Meghan is pictured during her first Christmas with the royals in 2017 \u0027The drinks trolley only appears before lunch, before and after dinner, you can\u0027t just help yourself. Only fine wines are allowed at the table, not off it. It\u0027s a very regimented house.\u0027Unlike most families who have eaten too much and settle down in front of the TV, the Queen and her family will be making their own entertainment.\u0027They never sit around the TV like we do. There\u0027s no TV in the dining room, they make their own entertainment. \u0027As a Hollywood actress Meghan would be expected to excel if a game of charades is on the Christmas Day agenda.She will have been advised by Harry about how the day unfolds and also what present she could buy for the Queen.Recalling his visits to Sandringham he said: \u0027A book is a good present (for the Queen), she loves Jeffrey Archer novels and crime fiction. Or anything with horses or sport, but she loves a thriller.\u0027She always has a selection of the top 10 novels, if you\u0027ve ever had a novel in the top 10, then you can be sure that the Queen will have read it.\u0027He advises Meghan that \u0027practicality is the word\u0027 on buying a Christmas present for the Queen, someone \u0027who has everything\u0027, saying: \u0027Get something for the picnic, a tartan rug, Tupperware containers, something for the barbecue as Prince Philip likes tongs or the latest pepper mill. Or dog leads, as The Queen is always losing them.\u0027One year all the household staff had a collection and bought the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh an ice bucket with all our names inscribed into it.\u0027Maybe a flowering jasmine plant, that she loves the smell of, or a Hermes scarf, as she wears one all the time when walking with her dogs.\u0027The man that Diana described as her rock until her death in 1997 reveals some of the high jinks – often led by Prince Harry and William – at this most royal of Christmas celebrations: \u0027It\u0027s intense but fun for the family.\u0027 Burrell, who served as a footman to the Queen before becoming Diana\u0027s butler until her death in 1997, had told Daily MailTV that \u0027Sandringham is Downton Abbey on speed\u0027 and that it would be a Christmas \u0027full of egos\u0027, where she should stay close to Harry and the Queen - because other royals will be out to get her, setting \u0027traps\u0027.It comes after he prepped Diana when she first came into the family, by advising her to also get plenty of face to face chats the Queen, with the best time being \u0027when she\u0027s at her card table, where she will sit and play Bridge or Canasta and she\u0027ll ask people to join her.\u0027He says that Meghan\u0027s own family troubles – with her father Thomas Sr taking part in staged paparazzi photos and with her half-sister Samantha\u0027s publicity-hungry outbursts – could be nothing compared to what will hit her when she travels up to the family\u0027s country estate in Norfolk for four days from Christmas Eve."},{"url":null,"title":"Corbyn criticised saying ahead Brexit PM","story":"    JK Rowling struck out at Jeremy Corbyn in a biblical-style series of tweetsJK Rowling struck out at Jeremy Corbyn in a biblical-style series of tweets after the Labour leader said he would pursue Brexit if his party won a snap election.  Remain supporters heaped criticism on Mr Corbyn after he said he would recommend his party \u0027go back and renegotiate\u0027 a Brexit deal in time for Britain to leave the EU.Speaking to the Guardian, the Leader of the Opposition failed to  commit his party to backing Remain if a second referendum was called - and hit out at EU laws on state aid which he said blocked investment.But his remarks were attacked by the Harry Potter author in a 16-part Twitter thread she titled \u0027The Visitation of The Corbynites\u0027.After criticising \u0027Saint Jeremy\u0027 in her opening tweets, Ms Rowling continued: \u0027And she did answer, How shall the poor fare under Brexit, which thy Saint hath always in his secret heart desired, yet he hath not admitted what was in his heart, lest fewer attend his next Sermon on the Glastonbury B Stage. \u0027And they did answer, Saint Jeremy will achieve a miracle, and he shall bring forth a Jobs First Brexit and all the land shall rejoice.

Timetables are placed in guests\u0027 rooms, for instance, to ensure no one is late for drinks and meals. And if you are a Los Angeles native still learning to navigate The Firm\u0027s infinitely complex social mores, it is more daunting still.          The main house of the Sandringham Estate (pictured) is small by Royal standards, with accommodation described as \u0027cramped\u0027Having her sister-in-law close at hand would help. But then few doubt that a froideur between the two duchesses does exist, even if it has sometimes been overplayed. Sources say Meghan and Kate are \u0027very different people\u0027 and simply \u0027don\u0027t get on\u0027. It also emerged that Kate was left \u0027in tears\u0027 after a fitting for Princess Charlotte\u0027s bridesmaid\u0027s dress before Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding in May.One Royal insider gives a prosaic explanation for the Sussexes\u0027 seasonal sleeping arrangements. Last Christmas it was felt that allowing Harry and Meghan, then unmarried, to spend the night at the main house would be inappropriate. Inviting Meghan to share in the festivities in the first place had been a break with convention – there was no need to shatter protocol completely. Anmer Hall offered the perfect solution.But their marriage changed everything. It would now be unusual, said the source, for the couple not to stay with the Queen.Even so, it is a decision that will inevitably stoke further speculation. Certainly it is unlikely to halt the drip, drip of \u0027War of the Waleses\u0027 stories.How Meghan, naturally forthright, must be struggling to hold her tongue.          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stayed with the Cambridges at the nearby Anmer Hall (pictured) last ChristmasIt was reported last week that she put paid to her husband\u0027s plans to join the traditional Boxing Day pheasant shoot at Sandringham, just as she did last year, because of her opposition to bloodsports.Insiders now say this claim, which adds another layer to the notion of Meghan as dictatorial – \u0027What Meghan wants, Meghan gets,\u0027 as Harry is said to have put it – is wrong.Harry did indeed miss last year\u0027s shoot, but only because he had to drive to London for a meeting the following day. And this year nothing has yet been decided, according to a Palace source.True, the Duchess is an ardent animal lover but she is understood to be relaxed about Harry\u0027s hobby. So much so that on several occasions this year she has accompanied her husband on shoots, even though she has not actively participated herself. The most recent was earlier this month at a friend\u0027s Wiltshire estate.A source said shooting is \u0027ingrained in Harry\u0027s nature\u0027, adding that \u0027Meghan would never try to change that about him\u0027.The only public window into the Royal Family\u0027s Christmas will be the 11am annual outing to St Mary Magdalene Church on the big day itself. After last year\u0027s service, Meghan clung to Harry\u0027s arm, walking among the crowds alongside William and Kate, cementing her place in the so-called \u0027Fab Four\u0027.          One Royal insider said it was felt last year that allowing Harry and Meghan, then unmarried, to spend the night at the main house would be inappropriateThe message from senior courtiers is to expect the same united front this year, not to mention some carefully chosen outfits. With every scrap of body language likely to be scrutinised, neither duchess is likely to betray any hint of friction.Meghan is an actress after all, and the Duchess of Cambridge is also a seasoned performer who rarely puts a foot wrong.\u0027It will all be friendly – there is no way that you are going to be unfriendly to someone on Christmas Day,\u0027 said an insider. \u0027Especially when Meghan looks like she is about to have a baby at any minute. All will be smiles.\u0027There was one small hitch outside the church last year. Meghan\u0027s curtsy to the Queen ended up being more of a wobbly bob. In comparison, Kate\u0027s was executed perfectly. It is impossible to imagine that the Duchess of Sussex will make the same mistake this year.The regimented schedule begins on Christmas Eve when the Royal clan arrive at Sandringham in order of seniority, with Charles and Camilla the last to appear, mid-afternoon. This prevents the chaos of everyone pitching up at the same time and limits pressure on staff.Despite the scale of the event, the Queen is keen that as many staff as possible enjoy Christmas with their own families, and has a scaled-down retinue.          But Harry and Meghan\u0027s move to Sandringham could be interpreted as a snub amid rumours of tension between the two couplesOn arrival, the Royals are shown to their rooms. There are thought to be 29 bedrooms in the house, including some for staff.Each of the Queen\u0027s children have their own room. Her grandchildren are all treated equally. Those likely to have servants\u0027 rooms include the Queen\u0027s nephew, the Earl of Snowdon, his wife Serena and their children. His sister Lady Sarah Chatto, her husband Daniel and two children are also likely to be included.The family follow the German tradition of opening presents on Christmas Eve. Small jokey gifts are preferred. Harry was once given a \u0027grow-your-own girlfriend\u0027 kit from Kate, while he is said to have given his grandmother a shower cap.Princess Diana famously made a faux pas during her first Christmas by attempting to impress with cashmere sweaters.A source said: \u0027The Royal Family is very frugal when it comes to Christmas, it tends to be nothing lavish – that is taboo. With the children, it is slightly different – they will get the sort of presents most children expect.\u0027After briefly retiring to their rooms, the family reappear for a black-tie dinner. The Duke of Edinburgh, now 97, will spend some time at Wood Farm on the estate, a modest refuge of tranquillity that he has enjoyed for many years.He was seen nearby yesterday, driving himself around in a Land Rover. But tomorrow he will join the Queen in the main house.Across Christmas, numerous outfit changes are required, with the Duchess of York once complaining that she was obliged to change her clothes seven times in 24 hours.While this will probably not be a concern for fashion addict Meghan, she will have to adhere to the usual Royal dress code – particularly as a house guest of the Queen. The black nail polish she showcased at a recent awards ceremony would be considered attention-seeking.Next morning the Royals wake up to stockings by their beds filled with small gifts and fruit, before enjoying a full English breakfast served at around 8am. Getting ready for church is the next task. After the service, which Prince Philip is expected to attend this year, everyone returns to the main house for drinks before Christmas lunch.Despite the formality of the occasion, there is no seating plan and no starter.Guests are served turkey, which is carved by the head chef at the table, followed by Christmas pudding and a cheese course.There may be time for the family to wander around the grounds, but they are back by 3pm for the Queen\u0027s Christmas message. After a tea at 4pm, featuring Christmas cake, mince pies and a chocolate yule log, Meghan – who is luckily eating for two – will sit down to another meal at 8pm a buffet of cold meats, salads and potatoes.          After Christmas, the Cambridges are expected to take George, Charlotte and Louis to the Middleton home in Bucklebury, BerkshireThe family will always find time for parlour games, with charades a particular favourite.The rules continue until bedtime, with no one allowed to retire before Her Majesty, who has been known to stay up until midnight.A Royal insider said: \u0027Everybody is on parade when they go to Sandringham. This is not a family sitting around having a jolly time relaxing. They are all eyeing each other up and seeing who is up and who is down the pecking order. It\u0027s full of tension.\u0027Rather like Camilla, who is said to hate Sandringham, Harry and Meghan will be out of the door as fast as they possibly can.\u0027After Christmas, the Cambridges are expected to take George, Charlotte and Louis to the Middleton home in Bucklebury, Berkshire.The Sussexes, meanwhile, will probably head to their bolthole in the Cotswolds. It is likely that at some point they will see Doria, Meghan\u0027s mother, who last week was still in Los Angeles but is expected to be flying in to the UK at some point during the holiday.While Doria would have been made welcome at Sandringham she will not be attending the activities there.\u0027Meghan certainty wants her mother around at Christmas, particularly as her father is making such a nuisance of himself at the moment,\u0027 said the insider.\u0027Meghan is isolated, things aren\u0027t going as well as they should be – she needs her mum.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Lin Manuel Miranda missed chance perform Hamilton Beyonc Jay Z fever","story":"    The Hamilton genius shared his misfortune while discussing the musical\u0027s impact on the Graham Norton Show on Friday nightMiranda was mentioning how tough it was to do the eight-performances-a-week while also dealing with the growing popularity of the show. He added: \u0027My wife was like, Stay in bed!\u0027 But I was like, I can do it, I can do it!

Existing legislation allows for \u0027bollard fencing\u0027 along the southern border           There, he harped that Senate Democrats working against his wall had favored fencing — until he called it a wall and ran for officeHe appeared to be responding to claims from inside and outside the White House that he would take $25 billion for border security over 10 years. That breaks out to $2.5 billion a year for border security, including $1.6 billion annually for the wall.Democrats have  otherwise offered Trump $1.6 billion in border security money that cannot be used on a concrete border wall and may not may not allow him to build the steel-slated fence that he\u0027s begun pushing.That bill places restrictions on where the president is allowed to build the barrier, limiting operations to the Rio Grande Valley.A summary of the legislation explicitly states that funds would be limited to the \u0027currently deployed fencing design along the southern border, such as bollard fencing\u0027 and cannot be used for \u0027building any barrier in the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge.\u0027A White House source told DailyMail.com that Trump wants the restrictions on where the fencing can be built dropped. Another offer of $1.3 billion for fencing also contains restrictions on where the wall can be built, making it a no-go as well for the administration.  Trump is refusing to sign any continuing resolution to fund the government that does not allow him to build a border wall.He rejected a bill Thursday that did not have the $5 billion for just the border barrier, leading to Friday night\u0027s government shut down.           The National Christmas Tree on the Ellipse near the White House is seen in Washington, Monday, Dec. 24, 2018. Visitors were turned away because of electrical problems due to the partial government shutdown          Litter spills out of a public dustbin next to the Washington Monument on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.          Because of the shutdown, some 380,000 federal workers were furloughed          Another trash can is seen overflowing on Pennsylvania Avenue on Monday morningSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has not responded to his administration\u0027s latest offer of $1.6 billion for steel slats without restrictions on where he can build the fencing.Incoming White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney revealed the offer on Sunday morning. \u0027We moved off of the five and we hope they move up from their 1.3,\u0027 he said on \u0027Fox News Sunday\u0027 of the state of play.He also warned the shut down could last well into the new year, when Congress changes hands and a new legislative session begins.\u0027It\u0027s very possible that this shutdown will go beyond the 28th and into the new Congress,\u0027 Mulvaney said. \u0027I don\u0027t think things are going to move very quickly here the next couple of days,\u0027 he added.          Incoming White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that the government shut down could last into new year          Trump continues to defend his wall          Trump touted the legislation he signed into law last week with a complaint most of the news coverage focused on his decision to remove U.S. troops from SyriaWith Christmas on the horizon, Congress has adjourned until Thursday, Dec. 27. And Lawmakers are expected to return to work late next week. The new Congress will be sworn into office on Jan. 3. If Mulvaney\u0027s prediction is correct, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi will begin her speakership under the cloud of a shut down.Even if her caucus passes legislation to end it, the onus will fall to the Senate to also pass it. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already said he won\u0027t bring any bill to the floor that the president has not already agreed to sign.A partial government shut down began on Friday at midnight amid a fight over funding for the president\u0027s border wall.  A furious Trump blasted it as a \u0027Democrat shutdown\u0027 as it was about to begin in a video of himself addressing the nation.\u0027We\u0027re going to have a shutdown. There\u0027s nothing we can do about that, because we need the Democrats to give us their votes,\u0027 he said. \u0027Call it a Democrat shutdown, call it whatever you want.\u0027He added, \u0027The shutdown hopefully will not last long. Thank you very much.\u0027 On Sunday, the president spent his day indoors, tweeting occasionally about news of the day.He said that \u0027only a good old fashioned Wall\u0027 works for border security even though drones and other technology are \u0027fun\u0027 and can also be used.\u0027The only way to stop drugs, gangs, human trafficking, criminal elements and much else from coming into our Country is with a Wall or Barrier. Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!\u0027 he said.  Negotiations appear at a stalemate. On Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence and Mulvaney went to Capitol Hill to speak with Schumer while Trump had lunch at the White House with hardline Republicans who back his wall.\u0027Still talking,\u0027 was all Pence had to say of the matter to reporters.On Sunday, Mulvaney sought to pin the blame for the shut down on Democrats. \u0027The ball is in the Senate\u0027s court,\u0027 he said. \u0027We made them an offer yesterday afternoon.\u0027He also claimed that what Trump wanted built falls within the arena of what Democrats\u0027s have already approved. \u0027The president tweeted out a picture yesterday the steel fence, the steel slated fence with a pointed top and so forth, that\u0027s what we want to build. And the Democrats\u0027 mind, that is not a wall,\u0027 Mulvaney said.\u0027So they have offered this $1.3 billion to build the barrier that we want but then they go on TV and say there\u0027s no money for a wall. We\u0027ve already told the Democrats we want to build what the president tweeted out. It doesn\u0027t have to be a 30-foot high concrete.\u0027 \u0027Fox News Sunday\u0027 host Chris Wallace pressed him on the issue. \u0027So, you think that they would approve $1.3 billion to build this deal picket fence?\u0027 Wallace asked. Mulvaney replied, \u0027Exactly.

hostel to visit underprivileged children          He arrived in the border town, dressed for cooler weather, as he prepared to act like Santa to surprise the kids          His friend held up some of the toys he was ready to present to the young boys and girls at the hostel          The Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s father traveled to Tijuana where he handed out toys, games and sweets to children at a hostel for homeless families just 200 yards from the border crossing between Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, in California (pictured in Tijuana)          The group of friends had loaded up their SUV

of his rift with his daughter just before her wedding to Prince Harry.The 74-year-old was revealed to have staged paparazzi photographs in Rosarito, where he has lived alone since retiring as a Hollywood lighting director, posing with a guidebook to Britain and pretending to have measurements for a weddings suit.The clumsily-staged photographs have led to Markle Sr. not speaking to his daughter since, and he has admitted he has never spoken to his new son-in-law.But the humble surroundings in which Markle Sr. delivered Christmas toys and food to the desperate and the homeless present a new side to the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s father.He had hinted at the plan for his Christmas in an interview earlier this month for the Mail on Sunday.A father of three and already a grandfather of five - all of them grown adults, and all largely estranged from his older son and daughter - he also used an interview with MailOnline editor-at-large Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain to speak of his sadness that he has been \u0027ghosted\u0027 by his daughter.After his charitable Christmas giving, Markle and his friends went for lunch in Rosarito, where he played happily with the children just like an involved grandfather.In contrast to his face-to-face encounter with poverty and desperation at the U.S. border, the Duchess of Sussex spent Christmas Eve with the royal family at Sandringham, the Queen\u0027s country estate in Norfolk.    Thomas Markle spent around 10 minutes speaking with deportees at the border point while handing out Christmas gifts          Meghan\u0027s father will surely be hoping the generous gesture will curry favor with the Royal household and bring him closer to his daughter, after he was forced to miss out on her wedding to Prince Harry          After handing out gifts to those less privileged than himself, Mr Markle headed for lunch in his hometown of Rosarito with his friends and grandchildren          Most of the migrants have been deported from the US, but camped out near the border in the hopes of reentering the country          Mr Markle stands among tents housing deportees from the US in Tijuana, Mexico, on Christmas Eve          After his charitable Christmas giving, Markle and his friends went for lunch in Rosarito, where he played happily with the children just like an involved grandfather           The humble surroundings in which Markle Sr. delivered Christmas toys and food to the desperate and the homeless present a new side to the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s father          Mr Markle fetches more gifts from a carrier bag with C3PO and R2D2 from Star Wars printed on the sideShe was due to spend Christmas morning at St Mary Magdalene\u0027s Church before heading back to the house to spend the day with her royal relatives.The visit to those living in deep poverty on the southern side of the U.S. border will inevitably be seen as having political dimensions.Markle Sr. previously made clear his own negative view of Donald Trump, whose hardline rhetoric and policies on immigration are seen by critics as causing a crisis at the border.His daughter has been compelled to avoid public political statements since her romance with Prince Harry began, but she previously spoke of her support for 2016 presidential Democratic loser Hillary Clinton.However she has been public in her advocacy for the under-privileged in the UK, promoting a cookbook for those affected by the Grenfell Tower disaster, a fire in public housing close to her current home in Kensington Palace which claimed 71 lives.Her view of his charity with the destitute at the border remains to be seen, with their ugly public spirit continuing unabated, despite the expected arrival of his sixth grandchild in April.This month his other two children, Samantha and Thomas Jr., pleaded publicly with Meghan to end the rift \u0027before it is too late\u0027. "},{"url":null,"title":"Abraham Lincolns merciful Christmas letter Confederate cousins urging unity sells 60K","story":"    Abraham Lincoln mercifully responded to his wife\u0027s Confederate cousins\u0027 request to return to Arkansas land taken over during the Civil War and the paper was  sold last weekA letter from Abraham Lincoln written during the Civil War sold for $60,000 last week to an unnamed buyer in the Northwest.The note from 1863 was recently purchased by The Raab Collection but Nathan Raab confirmed they exchanged the historic document for tens of thousands of dollars after an inidual showed interest.In the handwritten communication, the 16th President of the United States showed mercy to former slave-owning couple on death\u0027s door who wished to return to the Arkansas land they\u0027d been turfed off just before Christmas.Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in September 1962, declaring all slaves free as of January 1 the following year.But the Craig family, who were cousins of his wife Mary Todd, turned to the leader for permission to go back to their plantation before their lives ended.Lincoln met with then signed the paper a few days before the holiday saying he wished them to reoccupy the place without interference from Union forces.

He has since married another woman.The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester was told the fraud took place between April 2013 and November 2015 after Nkoma split up with the child\u0027s mother who lives in Coventry.Lawyer for the General Medical Council, Robin Kitchin said: \u0027Over a 15 month period, he provided information to the Child Support Agency knowing it was false. \u0027He was receiving money in his accounts from a business whilst saying that he couldn\u0027t make payments. He also said he was looking for regular work in the UK whilst living in Zimbabwe.\u0027It was found that he had six bank accounts with Halifax, and six bank accounts with HSBC. He was earning over £100,000 across work and his business over that time. He had over £126,000 being transferred across his personal accounts and had been working for agencies in the UK.\u0027The amount of money owed built up to £40,800.\u0027Nkomo who has unrelated conviction for failing to provide a specimen of breath told the hearing how he had endured a \u0027horrible split\u0027 with his ex-partner and claimed he failed to make required support payments as he had been denied access to his son.He said: \u0027I was frustrated at not being able to see him although I know this is not an excuse for what happened.          Nkomo said he had endured a \u0027horrible split\u0027 from his ex-partner and claimed he failed to make required support payments as he had been denied access to his son\u0027I am appalled at my behaviour. I applied for mediation as things with my ex partner were difficult. I would travel to Coventry to be told I couldn\u0027t see my son. I asked for evidence that he was in the country and said I would be happy to pay if he was - but she did not do this.\u0027It was not my intention to not pay, I was just trying to get access to my son. I realise just because I was not seeing him I should still have paid but I was not running away from paying for my son - it was about getting contact with him.\u0027For most of his life I would see him through a car window or I couldn\u0027t take him to the park, I couldn\u0027t do things that fathers and sons do. I have three children and stooped way too low.\u0027Being a father, being a religious person, more importantly being a doctor, I stooped way too low. It has lowered my expectations of myself and I should not have lied. That is not me. I did not go about this the right way at all and I am ashamed of this.\u0027My eldest son is nine, I am still trying to get contact with him and planning to go through legal processes again. I am going to preservere, he is my son, I will do whatever it takes.\u0027I attended a separated parents course which gave me an insight about what emotions different parents go through. I understand the importance of paying and I realise I need to focus on my family and not a fight. I have now been honest in my relationship and my work, and tried to be a changed person.\u0027Nkomo\u0027s lawyer Stephen Chinnery said: \u0027He accepts what has happened and regrets it all. He is very sorry and was going under extreme stress at the time with access to his child being difficult. This is not an excuse but puts it does explain the context of the offences. He attended a course and has had time to reflect to make sure this never happens again.\u0027But panel chairman Mr Russell Butland said: \u0027Dr Nkomo\u0027s actions were dishonest, calculated and persistent. He continued his dishonest actions for approximately two years and seven months, and he accrued approximately £40,800 illegally by his dishonest interactions with the CSA, having had multiple opportunities to declare his true status.\u0027The Tribunal concluded Dr Nkomo\u0027s actions and his criminal conviction have had the effect of bringing the profession into disrepute and betraying the public\u0027s trust in the profession. The public expects doctors to open and honest in all financial dealings.\u0027Mr Butland added: \u0027When questioned on whether his employment income and idends recorded as paid in his 20162017 tax return represented all of his locum income earned, the tribunal was sceptical that Dr Nkomo\u0027s evidence as to his income was accurate.\u0027Dr Nkomo estimated that he worked for 46 weeks in that tax year as a Locum GP, usually for three or four days each week\u0027When questioned as to how much he earned per month as a locum Dr Nkomo sought to avoid answering the questions, even saying he was unable to give an estimate.\u0027Eventually he stated that he had earned approximately £30,000 in the last three months, a figure potentially inconsistent with his assertion that he only earned £43,000 in the entirety of the 20162017 tax year.\u0027The Tribunal was concerned by these potential inconsistencies, and by Dr Nkomo\u0027s attempts to evade questions on his income.\u0027Erasure is the only sufficient sanction which would maintain public confidence in the profession and send a clear message to the profession and the public that Dr Nkomo\u0027s misconduct constituted behaviour unbefitting and fundamentally incompatible with that of a registered doctor.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Iceberg Argentina flips freezing ocean reveal shimmering blue underside","story":"    Italian filmaker Stefano Tiozzo was on a tourist boat filming the stunning view of Los Glaciares National Park, in Argentina, on November 26, 2018, when the floating body of ice suddenly turned on itself with a massive roar.           As the iceberg turned over it revealed its shiny blue underwater base           As it settled, the iceberg appeared to glow bright blue under the midday sunAs it settled the glacier appeared to glow bright blue under the midday sun.Stefano said: \u0027I was lucky to have my camera switched on before the iceberg started spinning.\u0027That way I was able to film the whole transition of colours and shapes which was exceptional to see.\u0027The boat from which Stefano filmed was cruising on Lago Argentino, the biggest lake in the country, which gets its waters from the melting glaciers close-by.Grandfather, 65, spends two years recreating the doomed...Standing on top of the world: Polar bears tread carefully on...Share this articleHe said: \u0027Most likely, the iceberg had detached from the Spegazzini glacier a few weeks before.\u0027Icebergs flip over a number of times during their life, because their underwater surface melts faster and becomes lighter than the one above, causing their centre of gravity to switch.\u0027However, it happens once every few months, and it\u0027s a very rare thing to be able to see.\u0027Even the guide on the boat said it was the first time he had seen something of this kind.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Six year old twins MARRIED parents believe partners past life","story":"    The young boy, nicknamed Guitar, and his sister, Kiwi, were born in September 2012 and were married in Samut Prakan on the outskirts of Bangkok, Thailand, last Monday          The twin\u0027s father Amornsan Sunthorn Malirat (right), 31, and mother, Phacharaporn (left), 30, arranged a lavish ceremony costing the equivalent of thousands of pounds for their children          The young boy had to pay a dowry of 200,000 baht in cash and gold worth the equivalent of £1,000 before marrying his twin sister          Buddhists believe that male and female twins (such as those pictured) have \u0027karma\u0027 from relationships in a previous life and have been re-born togetherThey say that unless they\u0027re married as quickly as possible once they\u0027re old enough, they will experience bad luck in the future.The twin\u0027s father Amornsan Sunthorn Malirat, 31, and mother, Phacharaporn, 30, arranged a lavish ceremony costing the equivalent of thousands of pounds for their children in Samut Prakan on the outskirts of Bangkok, Thailand, last Monday.The picture of innocence: A healthy two-week old baby is...British backpacker who broke her neck jumping into a pool in...Share this articleAmornsan said: \u0027The reason for the marriage ceremony is because we believe that both the children used to be a partners in the past life.

Not everybody eats turkey.\u0027We give them presents - everybody will get presents.\u0027It will be something useful - not just chocolates.\u0027I got the idea for it when I was doing my mental health nursing degree at the University of Nottingham.\u0027I was so excited because it was Christmas - but one patient said to me \u0027stop it, woman - not everybody likes Christmas\u0027.\u0027She said she wasn\u0027t looking forward to Christmas because it\u0027s a lonely time.\u0027I then did research into festive loneliness, and found out many people would rather be in hospital than at home, because they wouldn\u0027t be on their own on Christmas day.\u0027I now do this throughout the year for elderly people and people in independent living.\u0027I am orced, and I was lonely as well - I didn\u0027t realise until I started doing this.\u0027I find it fascinating to come together with people who all share similar journeys with me.\u0027When people start seeing Christmas stuff on the shelves and the lights go up, it sends people into depression.\u0027But if they know there is a group of them in the community, it makes them happy.\u0027This year, Mo fell into hot water when Nottingham City Council ordered her to take down flyers she had posted around the city advertising the event.But the council, which had previously praised her work, backed down and allowed her to continue posting her material.Councillor Linda Woodings, representing the Basford ward of Nottingham, said it was \u0027a really worthy cause\u0027 and there had been a \u0027genuine misunderstanding\u0027.

He needed blood to sign each of his paintings … the blood of those who loved him – people who thought they loved a human being, whereas they really loved Picasso.” The damage is well documented: Picasso’s second wife Jacqueline, his longtime muse and lover Marie-Thérèse Walter and his grandson Pablito all took their own lives. His son Paulo, Marina’s father, struggled with depression and died in 1975 from alcohol-related illness.Does great art justify monstrous selfishness? Must the lovers and children crushed by the careless cruelties of genius accept their suffering as inevitable, even irrelevant? Can they ever claim their lives as their own? These are the questions at the heart of The Italian Teacher, Tom Rachman’s Costa-shortlisted third novel.Bear Bavinsky (who disparages his “overpraised” rival Picasso as “that clown”) is a charismatic American artist of growing reputation in 1950s Rome. In his paint-splattered studio, where he lives in bohemian squalor with his young wife and son, he creates his “Life Stills”, huge, wildly coloured canvases portraying a single magnified detail of the female body, “a roll of tummy fat, or a pricked shoulder”, but never the subject’s face. Though he paints feverishly, Bear judges only a handful of the paintings he makes fit to keep. The rest he burns. He disdains private collectors in favour of galleries and museums who will put his work on public display. Of course his apparent indifference to commercial success only enhances his reputation. By the 80s Julian Schnabel is describing Bavinsky as “the greatest of the modern American greats”.Rachman has terrific fun skewering the hyperbole and hypocrisies of the art world. While it is hardly virgin territory, he brings a shrewd eye and a knack for aphorism that lend his observations a satisfyingly sharp edge. “Popularity is a tan,” one dealer observes tartly. “It fades when out of the light.” Satire, however, is not his main business. Though Bear is the blazing sun around whom everyone in The Italian Teacher orbits, the novel’s protagonist is his son Charles, or, as Bear calls him, Pinch, after pinxtos, the little snacks served in Spanish bars. Pinch hero-worships his father and, like a snack, Bear swallows his son whole, feeding off his devotion and granting in return short bursts of attention cut with much longer periods of careless disregard. Pinch tries desperately not to mind. The work, he knows, must always come first. After Bear leaves for New York and a new wife, teenage Pinch, aching for his father’s approval, devotes himself to painting. His potter mother praises his talent but it is Bear’s brutally offhand dismissal that strikes home. “I gotta tell you, kiddo,” he tells Pinch. “You’re not an artist. And you never will be.”A shattered Pinch turns to art history in the hope of writing Bear’s biography when that plan stalls he takes a job as a teacher at a language school. His life shrinks, crushed between his yearning to live up to his father and the terror that he will end up like his increasingly unstable mother. Bear appears in his life in brief, bright, heart-breaking flashes, like a god or an avenging angel, smashing Pinch’s small certainties before vanishing again.Pinch’s middle years are a study in neediness, disappointment and self-disgust: “With hideous clarity, Pinch sees himself: a pompous bore, a man he’d dislike.” While psychologically acute, this poses novelistic challenges Rachman appears at first not quite to meet. In its central third the novel slows to a crawl as Pinch limps through his lonely, colourless existence, unwilling to recognise his father’s monstrousness or admit his own collusion, unable to forge a convincing self of his own. Passively, unhappily, he sags into middle age. The plot, such as it is, sags too.It seems a surprising miscalculation from a novelist of Rachman’s calibre until the book reaches its final climactic third and he delivers his sucker punch of a payoff. Against the odds, almost against his will, Pinch does something extraordinary, something that will ensure a complete reworking of the record and extract a kind of revenge that is both exhilarating and terrible. The final chapters recast both father and son in a different light, compelling us to revisit our assumptions, to look at them – and the novel itself – afresh. The satisfaction of the ending, and its moral ambiguity, underscore the impossibility of easy answers. Is the work all that matters? The critical and popular adulation that greeted the recent Picasso show at Tate Modern would seem to say that it is. But The Italian Teacher pushes us further. If success is at least as much about the artist as the work, and its value as much about the market as the artist, then what possible hope is there for authenticity?• Clare Clark’s In the Full Light of the Sun will be published by Virago in February.

In an age of ision and negativity, the conversation among our readers – both in the comment threads below our pieces and across social media – is surprisingly positive and constructive.Of course we get the odd threat, and person claiming to be the Messiah, and threat from person claiming to be the Messiah. In general, however, Cities readers have spent five years showing themselves to be supportive, impassioned, engaged in ideas, lovers of the local – and, well, nice.Still, I wasn’t quite prepared for the email I received last month from a woman named Laura Armistead.“There are two men who bring Christmas cheer to the Peckham area every December,” she began, referring to the south London neighbourhood. “They choose a local business and recreate the building in gingerbread. Then they make a surprise delivery to the establishment. Khans bargain store was the first followed by the Persepolis restaurant. Last year it was Cod Fellows fish and chips.”The email ended: “It is a feel good story with no commercial benefit. The two men are Oliver Singleton and Jon Armistead. Thank you and merry Christmas.”I replied, particularly curious at the repetition of the name Armistead, and got the following response.“Thank you for responding Chris. I’m Jon’s mum and I live in Canada. I think what he and his partner do is so cool.”“It seems my mom has been a bit sneaky and told you about the gingerbread tradition I’ve had with my partner over the past few years,” Jon replied when I followed up with him. “It was never something we’ve wanted to flaunt, but I don’t suppose it would hurt to share some pictures with you.”So he did.“Everyone is genuinely confused as to why we’ve made a gingerbread house for them,” Jon explained. “The first question is usually, ‘Why?’ We just thought that it would be much more interesting to make something after an iconic building in our neighbourhood.“When we first delivered the Khan’s gingerbread, Mr Khan’s brother received it. A nearby customer instantly went to take a photo, and he half-jokingly replied: ‘Photos are £5.’ They proudly displayed the gingerbread at the top of a display of flowers and a stuffed tiger. When we asked about it, an employee told us, ‘Boss man says it stays.’”“Both Persepolis and Codfellas displayed theirs for a similar length of time, however Codfellas took the facade off and framed it, and it’s been preserved a little longer and displayed in their restaurant.“I make the plans in cardboard first, we bake the gingerbread together, and Oliver does most of the fine decoration. We assemble it together and then instantly whisk it off to its intended location. There’s always a risk that the proprietors won’t be in to receive it.“I work at Camberwell College of Art and I absolutely love our neighbourhood. What I love is how it feels like its own tiny city,” he said, going on to name Cravings La Carreta, Salas food truck, Steamer London, Cod Fellas and One\u0026ampAll Cafe as some of their other favourite spots.It’s a local tale, but it fits with something we suspected when we started  Cities in 2014 – namely, that people tend to feel particularly engaged in urban issues, especially when national politics is leaving so many cold and alienated.Thousands of iniduals and groups in cities around the world have since proved us right – pushing for safer streets, protesting the privatisation of our public spaces, fighting the ill effects of gentrification, or just offering moral support to a local business at a time when high streets are being decimated.“Cities as big as London can sometimes feel quite impersonal, and a nice consequence of this tradition is that we end up feeling more connected to our area and some of the people here,” Jon told me. “But really, we just want to make these houses as a small expression of our gratitude.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7039ae7764e2594cd0f71f697fc70e6c7bf8f90d/41_43_4540_2724/master/4540.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8fe44095b4509a0c23451d1e931b971","title":"festive transport around the world in pictures","story":"Seasonally adjusted buses, trains and trams around the world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f2ef391952b1e332a66c174b94ab8c4b18d38d/0_0_4186_2511/master/4186.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee9c64dfeec112e54b0e43349f74d2ad","title":"corbyn given up europe labour brexit vote","story":"As Labour subscribes to the government’s dangerous Brexit fantasies, a people’s vote is now the only way to ensure stabilityThe debate about Brexit has entered a new and potentially chaotic phase. Britain has already suffered an economic and reputational hit from the Brexit saga. Investments are on hold, jobs are being moved, the pound has lost value. Britain has come to be seen as a political risk rather than a force for stability. If our leaders continue to peddle illusions about the real choices, they risk turning damage into carnage.The first illusion is that the fundamental problem with Brexit is the faulty negotiating tactics of the government. This is said by both the Brexiters and the Labour leadership. Boris Johnson says Britain should have shown “more willpower”. Dominic Raab says we should have threatened to withhold agreed payments. Owen Paterson says we should embrace no deal to frighten the EU into concessions.The Labour leadership is not much better. Jeremy Corbyn’s  interview has rightly caused a furore. He makes clear that his difference with the government lies in tactics not goals, personnel not principles. The assertion – it does not deserve to be called an argument – seems to be that a better atmosphere would get a better deal. But this is a confusion at best and a fantasy at worst.There is no doubt that the government has botched the negotiations, with everything from the red lines over the customs union and single market to the premature triggering of article 50 (with, it must be remembered, Corbyn’s support) and the partisan approach adopted by the prime minister.But this is a flawed starting point. The problems of the Brexit negotiations are structural and not primarily the result of the government’s incompetence. The contortions of Brexit are integral to it rather than incidental. The promises of Brexit can never be squared with each other or with reality. There is no future state where frictionless trade and the commitments of the Good Friday agreement (to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic) are compatible with departure from the customs union and single market. The debate about the backstop is a symptom of the problem, not the core problem. If you leave the club, then you cannot enjoy the benefits.A second illusion is also vitally important. This is the idea that if Theresa May’s plan, or the Labour version of it, is passed, then we could be done with Brexit and get on with improving the country. The reality is that if the May plan is voted through, the contortions that have bent it out of shape will continue. They will reappear, many times, when the negotiations about the future relationships between the UK and EU finally get into detail and expose the trade-offs that were fudged in the 26-page political declaration appended to the withdrawal agreement.The desire to get shot of Brexit from the headlines, to free up political and economic ability to get on with addressing the growing problems facing the country, is understandable. But the only way to create space for the country to move beyond Brexit is to give it the chance to decide whether to proceed with Brexit. There is no realistic future where we continue to negotiate with the EU and have the bandwidth to mobilise national willpower for the big challenges ahead.There is one final illusion: the notion that the world beyond Europe is waiting to offer juicy trade deals to Britain. The EU has trade deals with more than 70 countries already, as well as facilitating trade with the likes of US and China through a series of side agreements that in the case of the US number no less than 147 to supplement the WTO minimum standards.All of these other “third countries” have interests of their own. It is a fantasy to think that they are going to do anything other than confront Britain with very unpalatable choices – literally, in the case of America’s chlorinated chicken. There are three rule-makers in the 21st century: the EU, the US and China. Opt out of the EU, and we are rule-takers.The prevalence of these illusions has become tiresome for our European neighbours, compounded by the attempt to blame them for the mess. I was told by someone who was there that after this month’s European council meeting, they “just want this issue to go away”. But my European friend added: “I have no words to express my sadness about all this.”The paradox of our current situation is that our European neighbours are becoming hacked off just as the UK debate brings the possibility of a referendum closer than it has been before. A people’s vote is not an admission of defeat or a poke in the eye to those who voted leave. “Better safe than sorry” is the right approach when buying a house, and so makes sense when making a momentous national decision.The alternative to a bad deal – the May plan – is not no deal. It is reported that five cabinet members can now see their way to supporting a people’s vote. They need to insist that preparations begin now. Gordon Brown has made a good point that a referendum needs to be carefully prepared if it is to begin the healing process. The evidence from Ireland’s citizen’s assembly, is that referendums do not need to be isive – even on issues that go to the core of national character – if citizens are involved in drawing up the question and participating in the debate. That takes time, but it is time well spent. That needs to be urgently negotiated.We know Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump want Britain out of the EU. But their interests are not our interests. We have no time to lose in getting to grips with reality, sloughing off the illusions that have held sway on right and left, and embracing a vision of Britain’s future that is positive, empowered, progressive – and European.• David Miliband is president and CEO of International Rescue Committee and former UK foreign secretary"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0439b9699eabdf3f6c4a37945ec0c626d90be373/0_166_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=905d01a9643d869f360e853c7f33275a","title":"brexit uk global joke rebuild reputation","story":"You know you’ve hit rock bottom when the Germans mock you on primetime TV and the jokes are actually quite funny. Giving Britons this year’s “golden dumbass” prize, Oliver Welke, the German equivalent of Dara Ó Briain, describes how Theresa May “can’t get out of the EU and can’t even get out of her bloody car”, over pictures of Angela Merkel waiting embarrassedly outside her Berlin residency as the door of our prime minister’s limo fails to open. “Just go!” the host yells. “Hard Brexit, soft Brexit, liquid Brexit, just fog off!” Next, he shows a cartoon of a man in a bowler hat repeatedly burning his hand on a hot stove, then stabbing his eye with a fork. The audience is falling about laughing. Welke’s Heute Show on ZDF may not have the cachet of the US equivalent, the Daily Show, but it is good at reflecting the moment.Britain is now the butt of global mirth and cringe-making sympathy. I spent most of this autumn on trips trying to link our creative industries with those of other countries. From Mexico City to Montreal, Amsterdam to Tallinn, the welcome starts with the avuncular hand on the shoulder, a sigh and a reference to “our British friends”, followed by “I hope you’re all right”.Consternation over the original referendum decision long ago gave way to bafflement over the chaos. “What on earth is Mrs May doing playing pantomime host in the House of Commons at a time like this?” someone asked me last week. “We used to think that you were serious, reliable people.” Americans and Europeans used to tune in to our parliamentary antics to wonder at the jousting. Now they are baffled that we continue to play games at a time like this. I am constantly asked why we hark on about the second world war, as if we are stuck in time and are not proud of our achievements since.The gulf between those trying to sell the UK’s skills and modernity and the poor calibre of our political culture is hitting hard. Business groups, which had been surprisingly cowed, are now waking up to the dangers of the brain drain. It is not just young, ambitious Europeans who are moving home, apparently to our prime minister’s delight. The movement of talented Britons to other countries is steady and will grow, as the reality of Brexit sinks in. Why work in a country that regards economic self-harm as just one of those things you have to get through? Why work in a country that permits people to come rather than welcomes them?The atmospherics are particularly important for those working in, or planning to work in, the knowledge economy – the nexus between science, technology and creativity. These three sectors have, since the financial crash of a decade ago, been the growth engine for the United Kingdom.People used to flock to us, as world leaders in these fields. Perhaps they will again. But for the moment, the direction of travel is in the opposite direction. The Germans are making a beeline for British talent. The Dutch are marketing themselves as a new centre for the creative industries. Lisbon is hot on tech. At its peak, London had so many French nationals working in the capital, thanks to its entrepreneurial cachet, that it was somewhere between the sixth- and ninth-largest French city (depending on how you count the population). Brain drains become self-fulfilling. France, the old saying went, is where you go to relax. Britain is where you go to work. No more.Brexit has already deeply damaged the British brand. The idea that we could compensate for the loss of European markets and political influence by growing markets elsewhere was always a folly, driven by ideological extremism. The view from countries outside the European Union about the state of Britain is no different to those inside – apart perhaps from a few rightwing thinktanks in Washington, which is one city that I haven’t frequented.We have been here before. I remember the 1970s as a young boy. Britain was a laughing stock, the “sick man of Europe”. The UK’s desperately poor productivity, terrible labour relations and propensity to strike earned the tag “the British disease”. Our growth rates consistently lagged behind those of the first members of the European Economic Community. Indeed, their economic success, and our weakness, was a driving force behind us joining the trade bloc. Trips to Europe were expensive – and exotic. Between 1939 and the early 1990s London lost a quarter of its population. Then it became attractive and the reverse happened. These cycles occur for cities and countries. The two peaks of “cool Britannia”, in the late 1990s and around the London Olympics of 2012, feel a long time ago.This is not zero-sum, not a blind eulogy to “the other”. France is mired in protests as the Macron gloss wears off. Spain has handled its constitutional bind with Catalonia with violence and heavy-handedness. Germany frets about life after Mutti Merkel. Italy has a caricature far-right and far-left government. Vladimir Putin is working his way through Europe, fomenting extremism.Whatever transpires with Brexit, the British brand is tarnished. The mediocrity tag takes time to shake off. It is likely to take somewhere between a decade and a generation for it to recover. Given that politicians can’t be relied upon to remedy the mess of their own making, it will be the lot of everyone else to rebuild our reputation as a go-getting, open nation – one that is worthy of respect rather than cheap jokes.• John Kampfner is former CEO of the Creative Industries Federation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad16437b297e8b5d71a9b6ecd41f17fc2a86287f/0_233_7000_4200/master/7000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41e4909345598082c0a56405794cacdd","title":"christmas iphone gadget unplug","story":"The secret to throwing away your technology crutch for the festive season is planning – that and plenty of wine and boozeThe holidays are almost here. Can you feel it? The last-minute dinner and travel plans coming together. The excited messages between family members. A palpable sense that your children are watching movies all week as their teachers check out. A visible belt of cookie fat spilling over your waistline.Come Christmas Eve, even those of us who don’t celebrate the birth of Jesus will revel in a little bit of silence in this great awful noisy world. For two days traffic will slow down, work pants and laptops will sit idle, and the phone will slow its incessant buzzing to a trickle.That’s the hope, anyway. The reality is that the internet and its enablers know no holiday. But with scandals and studies and public distrust of Silicon Valley’s particular brand of digital nicotine growing, there are increasingly bold calls to embrace this holiday season unplugged, without phones or tablets or screens of any kind. Turned off. Tuned in. Singing carols with no one filming, just like the heavens intended.For most people unplugging is a daunting goal. How do you shut out the shining light of civilization that comforts you when you are lonely, soothes your worries (while simultaneously exacerbating them), snuffs out tedium with a single swipe, and also works as your phone, map and lifeline to the outside world? How can you embrace the unplugged holidays without going full-on The Shining from boredom?While the lifestyle bloggers may present an imagine of a slender woman in lotus pose at the end of a dock on an alpine lake as the instant outcome of turning off your phone, the reality is more complicated. Nothing will change right away. The house will be the same house. The children who are off school and destroying that house will still need to be entertained. Boredom is ever present. Yoga is hard.The secret to a successful holiday disconnect is planning.Guess what? If a friend or relative walks into your home on Christmas Eve, and is immediately forced to surrender their phone without warning, like some awful interaction gone wrong at the border, then you will have replaced digital distractions with analog resentments. Get everyone on the same page about unplugging by spreading the word early. Start by talking with your immediate familyroommatesfriends that this is something you’d like to try, why it’s important, and how you think it can be fun. Then casually spread the word to those you’ll be spending time with, starting with obvious sympathizers and then moving out to the sceptics.Frame it as something casual (but not necessarily optional). “This holiday we’re trying to be more connected, so please leave your phones at home and help us embrace each other. Hugs!” Or something even less passive aggressive.A state of perfect, Leonard Cohen-like Zen will not simply spring up once you power down, especially if you are doing it with others. Idle time for the unplugged is Mark Zuckerberg’s handiwork, so make sure you are replacing the digital distractions with something vastly more attractive in the real world. These plans do not need to be elaborate scavenger hunts or exotic vacations.Start with an aimless Christmas walk over a few hours. Or tackle a cooking project together as a family: bake a loaf of bread, or a cake, or a gingerbread house. Carbs are your salvation here. Plan something outside that requires your full physical attention. Go skating, or skiing, or if you live somewhere warm, biking or swimming. Build a massive snowman or an elaborate snow fort or a sandcastle. Try to supplement digital interests with analog ones: take the Fortnite-addicted tween to play paintball, do a photo safari with Instagrammers, but with actual cameras, break out games of Risk or Dungeons and Dragons for the role-playing gamer.

Idle hands need something to hold, play with, and provide that sweet instant feedback. Break out the turntable and the records, or even the old CDs and cassettes. Stock up on board games, ranging from classics like Operation to new favorites such as Ticket to Ride. Buy (or borrow) an Instax or Polaroid instant film camera and get the film to go with it. Make your home into an all-ages daycare: musical instruments for jamming, comics and coffee table books and magazines to flip through (max out your library card), costumes for kids, tons of paper and craft supplies, Play-Doh, Legos and giant cardboard boxes.

Don’t scold or preach those still flipping through Twitter or playing YouTube videos at the dinner table. Lead by example, and by pushing more analog fun as an alternative.

Isn’t it about time parental elves got some glory for all the hard work?Christmas is such a bizarre and wonderful time. I buy into all of it: dragging a dead tree into my house and decorating it, eschewing any notion of a healthy diet, replacing this with a massive “sharing” tub of Quality Street and some sickly liqueur that I wouldn’t countenance at any other time of year, endless TV Christmas specials … the usual.And now that I have children, the “magic” side of it all has come into play. Every year we dash outside so I can show my daughters some variant of Santa’s sleigh passing over the house in preparation for visiting us later (thank you to various international space stations and Christmas Eve travellers keeping the planes in the air at this important time), we leave food and drink out for Father Christmas and the reindeer, their faces when they see on Christmas morning that “he’s been” are a delight …So, I’m not part of the “bah humbug” brigade: when else do you get to create magic and memories on quite this level?But it’s also safe to say that the festive season can be hard work and a lot of extra effort. And year after year I find myself ranting about the fact that my children are under the impression that the man in red has chosen, made, wrapped and delivered the presents from me and their dad. I’m cool with the old guy popping round on Christmas Eve when we’re all asleep, and maybe even dropping some small gifts into stockings, but is it about time he left the rest of the glory to the real people?My daughters’ dad’s position is that they’ll be grown up soon enough and realise for themselves that maybe mummy and daddy had something to do with it all, and let’s carry on letting them believe for now. I wish I could be as sanguine as that: every Christmas Eve sees an exhausted, frazzled me grumbling as I speed-wrap the presents I forgot about that I bought early, about Father bloody Christmas swanning in at the last minute, taking all the credit for other people’s hard work: both mine and the elves.I’ve put my foot down that gifts from other people are actually “from” them, not via Lapland – so right now we’re in the unsatisfactory position that our offspring think that everyone else buys them gifts but that we don’t: ours are made by unpaid elves and flown across the world in a sleigh.A quick straw poll of similarly overwrought friends shows that most people seem to feel the same way: “My son says that he’s asked Father Christmas for a top-end digital camera. Well lucky Father Christmas who doesn’t have to actually pay for it.”Back in 1988 Roald Dahl wrote a poem Mother Christmas about exactly this matter. These were different times, and when he stated that “I’ll bet you buy the presents  And wrap them large and small  While all the time that rotten swine  Pretends he’s done it all”. He was making a point about the patriarchy: that the burden of organising Christmas still tended to fall on women. Now, that’s a different rant, but I can really see where Dahl was coming from with this one.So, as the unsung magic makers, what can we do about this sorry state of affairs? Well, short of bursting the bubble and telling a few home truths (and I’m not rotten enough to do that), I’m not quite sure. So for now I’ll continue to both put up with and moan about it.And at least I get to scoff the big man’s mince pie and drink his brandy, right from under his nose every year.• Suzy Prince is the editor and publisher of Actual Size Magazine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66366dfbe06906cba05a65f881e21769d2a935da/0_322_4702_2821/master/4702.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8899828e3298517071813319e67dce6e","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of festive","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘festive’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘festive’ (please note that these are no longer published online).Share your photos of what festive means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 26 December at 10am.

My family never celebrated it. We put up our tree and opened our presents on New Year’s Eve, instead.But, when I was 10, in post-Soviet 1994, for Christmas, my family decided to take a pilgrimage to the tradition-laden Western Ukraine, a thousand kilometres away. We took a 16-hour train to get there, to discover our roots.We arrived to visit friends of friends on Christmas Eve. We were dropped off at a train station, in an outlandish location of dreams. For the first time, I saw a hill covered with a forest of Christmas trees with sparkling snow crystals.It was the mountainous area of the Carpathian Mountains.The friend of friends met us at the train station and said: “It’s not a long walk to the house, but there are no buses to take us there.” We said: “OK,” thinking it would take 10 minutes.Wrong. Little did we know, people who live in the Carpathians were used to walking or skiing everywhere. The “short walk” took an hour and a half in heavy snow.Exhausted, we finally arrived at a huge wooden house by a gushing brook, the sound of wolves howling in the distance. Inside, we were rewarded with a real traditional Ukrainian Christmas, full of colour. Guests wore beautifully made goat masks, violins were played and people were singing. The house was warm and cosy, with a roaring fire we stayed up by late into the night. We ate a traditional pescatarian feast: a mushroom borscht with wild mushroom-filled dumplings varenyky filled with potatoes and curd cheese local trout soft, yeasty buns called pyrizhky, filled with cabbage and prunes, and sweet ones filled with sweet poppyseed paste. It ended up being the most memorable Christmas of my life, and I long to recreate it.Stevie MartinWhile in most homes the giving and receiving of Christmas cards is a declining tradition, in our house – for my sister and I at least – it has evolved into a furiously fought competition. After the presents have been pored over while sat on my parents’ bed (I’m 30, my sister is 27, and we refuse to do it any other way), we give out Christmas cards. The rules are you can’t buy it from a shop, you have to make it yourself – and the loser has to make an extravagant breakfast.Gina, my sister, is an incredible artist. One year, she painted a picture of my parents. Another, she sketched an incredibly lifelike Father Christmas. Years ago, I figured out that I could win by making my parents laugh, seeing how little I could get away with. An A4 sheet of paper with a pine needle stuck on it using Sellotape above the words “HAPPY PINE-MAS”. Another year, I dribbled some gravy, drew a smiley face on it and dubbed the mess: “the gravy nativity”. Last year was blank, to represent the Holy Spirit.The only issue with this – apart from the fact that my cards get more traction than Gina’s, despite hers taking hours to create and mine taking roughly three minutes – is that I don’t know where to go after 2017’s blank card. It feels like I’ve reached the pinnacle of not caring. Do I give them no card? The world’s tiniest card? I suppose the only thing to do is go the other way – hire an artist and create an A0 canvas. Please pray for me – I’m terrible at making breakfast.Tom DugginsAs a vegetarian, Christmas sometimes feels like I’m under siege from otherwise well-intentioned friends and family who want to sneak meat into my food. If it’s not the yearly cry of “hang on, which gravy did we put the meat juices into?” (this tends to come mere seconds after covering my plate in the stuff), then there’s always the pleasure of arguing with my mum about whether the roast potatoes have to be cooked in goose fat or not. (No surprises on my position: olive oil and spuds go together like being vegetarian and only having one thing you can order on a menu.)That’s why, come 25 December, I like to focus on those parts of the traditional Christmas lunch that we can all get behind. Once the main course and pudding are all done with, there’s the vegetarian haven of the cheeseboard to look forward to.It’s like a culinary after-party taking place on your very own kitchen table. No one’s sneaking any sausage meat into the chutney or injecting pork grease into the soft cheeses and there’s no awkward discussion about who can have what, it’s just gorge time at the table and everyone’s invited.Christmas lunch tends to stress people out – getting the timings right is tough and there’s a lot of pressure overall. But with the cheese course, you’re ready to go in about five minutes: minimal effort for maximum satisfaction.Hayley CampbellAs far as I can tell, our only family Christmas tradition is pushing our oversized heads into too-small Christmas cracker hats until they split. We never wanted this tradition it was never planned. We have tried everything to get rid of it, short of having our skulls shrunk in questionable science experiments – such as balancing the hat on top of our spherical skulls and just not moving for the rest of the dinner, turning very slowly to address others at the table, the top of our bodies moving like Batman locked into his batsuit. But nothing works. The hats still split in two, or they topple into the gravy. It is an inevitability that we have given up dreading and merely succumbed to. If it’s just family at the table, we will turn the hats until the split is obvious, like a badge of big-headed honour. But we collectively fear work Christmas parties and being invited to Christmas dinner at other people’s houses. What if they make us put on the hats?Combining a creamy crumbly texture and mouth-watering garlic and herbs, Boursin is a welcome addition to any festive buffet – and a versatile soft cheese for your party season cooking, too.

Serve with artisan bread, salad and your choice of crudites, such as radishes, baby courgettes and grissini wrapped with Parma ham slices. Leftover dip? Spread on bagels and top with smoked salmon for an indulgent festive brunch.500g baby spinach, washed½ tbsp olive oil1 garlic clove, mincedSalt and ground black pepper150g Boursin garlic and herbs1 egg75g fine breadcrumbs100g parmesan, finely grated50g butter, melted, or good quality olive oilSmall handful sage leavesOlive oil, for fryingGnudi are Italian-style dumplings made with ricotta cheese. This version is packed with flavour and can be pulled off in just 30 minutes. Dressed with butter, parmesan and crispy sage leaves, this is main course material, but it could easily be halved and served as a starter.To prepare, put the spinach in a large saucepan and pour over a kettle full of boiling water. Allow the spinach to wilt for 3 minutes, then drain. Press the spinach in a colander set over the sink, squeezing out the water. Once dry, roughly chop.Put the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and add the garlic, cooking for 1 minute, until fragrant. Add the spinach with a generous amount of salt and black pepper, and cook for a further 2 minutes. Set aside to cool.In a large bowl, mix the Boursin with the egg. Add the spinach, stirring to combine, then add three-quarters of the breadcrumbs and mix well. Check the consistency – if it feels a little loose or sticky, add the rest of the breadcrumbs.Using your hands, shape the mix into pieces the size of ping-pong balls and put on a tray lined with greaseproof paper. Refrigerate while you fry the sage.In a small saucepan, heat 2cm of oil until shimmering. Add the sage leaves, frying for 30 seconds, until crisp. Drain on kitchen paper.Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil, then add the gnudi – you will need to do this in two batches, depending on the size of your pan. Cook for 2–3 minutes, until they float to the top. Remove from the water.Divide the gnudi between four plates, drizzle with the melted butter, scatter with the parmesan, sprinkle over the sage leaves, and finish with some black pepper.2 thick-cut pork loin chops1 lemon, halved2 sprigs lemon thyme, leaves pickedSalt and ground black pepperOlive oilFor the gratin:25g butter2 banana shallots, dicedSalt and ground black pepper1 garlic clove, halved250ml cream or whole milk150g garlic and herbs Boursin1 medium butternut squash, peeled and very thinly sliced50g gruyere, finely gratedFor something extra special, this wintry main is just the ticket. Here, Boursin has been added to the gratin sauce, creating a rich, savoury foil to the sweetness of the squash. The gratin is so good that it works just as well as a vegetarian main, served with a crisp green salad.To prepare, preheat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4 and rub the cut sides of the garlic clove around a medium-sized dish.Put the butter in a small frying pan over a medium heat and cook the shallots with plenty of seasoning for 5-10 minutes.Whisk together the Boursin and cream, or milk, until smooth, then season to taste.Layer the squash slices and shallots, adding salt and pepper to each layer in the baking dish, then pour over the milk and Boursin mixture, making sure it has seeped into the gaps. Scatter over the cheese, grind over some black pepper and cover with foil, then bake for 45 minutes.Roughly 15 minutes before the 45 minutes is up, prepare the pork. Rub with oil, season well, then, in a heavy-based frying pan over a high heat, hold the pork chops fat-side down in the pan, cooking for 2-3 minutes until golden. Fry on each side for a minute, until a little browned, then put in a small roasting tray, tucking the lemon and thyme around the chops.After 45 minutes of cooking the gratin, turn the oven up to 200Cgas mark 6. Uncover the squash, put the chops on the top shelf of the oven, then cook alongside the gratin for 15 minutes, until the cheese is golden brown, the squash is tender, and the pork is cooked.Bring a BoursinCombining a creamy crumbly texture and mouth-watering garlic and herbs, Boursin is a welcome addition to any festive buffet – and a versatile soft cheese for your party season cooking, too.

In my prime, I could eat upwards of 10 Carr’s table water biscuits slathered in Boursin after seconds of turkey pie and an inordinate amount of chocolate mould dessert.But as a grownup – and as someone who gets more excited over the possibilities contained within the leftovers than the initial purpose of an ingredient – the garlicky cheese with the chant-inducing advert has come to represent versatility as well as comforting familiarity. I’ve long been stirring Boursin through fettuccine with lemon-roasted broccoli, or dolloping spoonfuls on top of slow-roasted red peppers, tomato and fennel. I’ve whisked it with milk to make the sauce for potato dauphinois, combined with soured cream, red onions and prawns, and even spread it on stale sourdough, scattered with pancetta and baked with whisked eggs to make a savoury bread and butter pudding. As an ingredient, it is undeniably simple yet effective, saving the lives of many a withered fridge companion. However, my favourite use is a relatively recent discovery, from a French friend: a roast chicken recipe – with a twist.Requiring only three ingredients: Boursin, lemon and the chicken itself. One Boursin is stuffed into the bird’s cavity with half a lemon, and a second is smeared underneath and over the top of the skin. And that’s it. The result is a creamy, flavoursome and perfectly textured meat that the carver will undoubtedly be standing over and picking at long before it reaches the table.Since learning of this dish a few years back, I’ve found that it’s the perfect recipe for those mellow days between Christmas and the new year, when families are still gathered, but the enthusiasm for spending hours in the kitchen to create a celebratory spread for those around you has dissipated to eating cold stuffing and cranberry sauce from the fridge on the sofa. This roast chicken requires no more than five minutes of preparation, a chopping board and a roasting tin. But the best thing about this recipe? It perfectly balances familiarity and nostalgia with indulgence – and that’s exactly what the festivities are all about.1 free-range organic chicken2 x 150g Boursin½ lemonSalt and ground black pepper1 bunch purple sprouting broccoli, ends trimmed25g butterZest of 1 lemonRoast or mashed potatoes, to servePreheat your oven to 180Cgas mark 4.Remove the string from the chicken and stuff one of the Boursin into the cavity along with the lemon half. Ease the skin of the chicken loose, then spread half of the other Boursin under the skin, using your fingers. Spread the other half over the skin of the whole bird and season well.Lightly oil a roasting tray and place the chicken inside. Cook for 1-1½ hours, until the juice of the chicken runs clear when a knife is inserted into the thickest part of the leg. Allow to rest for 10 minutes.As the chicken is resting, steam or boil the broccoli, then toss with the butter, lemon zest and some seasoning. Carve the chicken and serve with the broccoli and potatoes.Bring a BoursinCombining a creamy, crumbly texture and mouth-watering garlic and herbs, Boursin is a welcome addition to any festive buffet – and a versatile soft cheese for your party season cooking, too.

Mulligatawny soup, faggots, mash and buttered sprout tops, steamed ginger pudding and custard, eaten around a table the size of my bedroom by a fog of candlelight – it was, to steal a title from Jane, a very Good Thing. It was the starter, though, that stuck in my memory like a Post-it, which was partly to do with the fact it was the first thing I put in my mouth (starters have the unfair advantages of anticipation and hunger), but also because it was an anchovy matchstick.Actually, “matchstick” is a bit misleading size-wise it was more toast soldier size: two fingers of puff pastry, sandwiching hard-boiled egg cream and an anchovy fillet, baked until risen and golden brown. Like all fried and puffed things, the key to anchovy matchsticks is eating them as quickly as you can while they are hot, otherwise they lose their charm. That night, in the basement of Italo delicatessen in the middle of Vauxhall, south London, the matchsticks were a warm concertina with a salty, piquant heart that only anchovies can provide. Following that dinner, I made two batches of anchovy matchsticks, one with egg, one with just anchovy, at my parents’ over the Christmas holiday. While not quite as good as Anna’s, they established a new tradition of gathering around the oven door to eat hot, salty matchsticks and drinking home-measures of negronis – as if we don’t have enough traditions already.You could make your own puff or ruff-puff pastry, or simply buy it… which transports me to the Waitrose on Finchley Road nearly 20 years ago, where I overheard a conversation between two elegant, elderly ladies, whom I imagined were sisters. “Will you get some puff pastry?” said one. “Fuck the puff pastry,” replied the other, calmly. “Let’s get ham.” At which they walked down the aisle, never to be seen again – by me, at least. Years on, and I can’t even read the words “puff pastry” without thinking of those two sisters.Despite my warm hands, I am a keen shortcrust and ruff-puff maker. I am also a keen pastry buyer – especially the rectangles I can get from the supermarket here in Testaccio. My bedside read at the moment is Rowley Leigh’s new book, which celebrates the “long and messy business” of cooking an antidote to a world fixated on speed and 10-minute meals. There is room, though, for both – the long and the messy and the quick, shop-bought bake. With 250g of puff pastry rolled into two rectangles and two small tins of anchovies, you can have a tray full of matchsticks ready in about 16 minutes, the oven doing most of the work.Cut the dough into 10cm-long, 2cm-wide soldiers, put half on a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper, lay an anchovy fillet on each, cover with the other half like a lid and press shut gently.

After Manchester City’s surprise defeat to Crystal Palace on Saturday left Liverpool four points clear at the top of the Premier League, Tottenham’s 6-2 thrashing of Everton the next day ensured three teams reached the 40-point mark before any presents have been opened for only the second time in the competition’s history. Had Chelsea managed to find a way past Leicester’s stubborn defence it would have been four in what is becoming the most absorbing battle for many years. The top three combined have accumulated more points at this stage of the season than ever before.Liverpool’s tally of 48 points has been bettered only once – by City last season before they went on to win the title with a record 100 points – so it is no wonder Klopp is making such bold predictions as he looks nervously over his shoulder. Yet while much has been made of Liverpool’s inability to turn Christmas supremacy into titles, having failed to do so on the past four occasions they have topped the table on 25 December (1990, 1996, 2008 and 2013), some older supporters will point to the 10 occasions on which they have gone on to become champions – starting in 1905.The most recent of those was more than 30 years ago in 1987, when John Barnes inspired Kenny Dalglish’s side to their 17th league title as they finished nine points clear of Manchester United. On only one of the previous six occasions had they failed to win the title – in 1981-82 when Aston Villa pipped them to first place – although being top at Christmas did lead to disappointment in 1968 too.In fact, and whisper it to the red half of Merseyside, Liverpool have a far more successful strike rate when they have gone into the post-Christmas programme in second spot, winning the title on six of those occasions out of eight. But after seven successive Premier League wins, and with home fixtures against Newcastle and Arsenal to come before they visit the Etihad Stadium on 3 January, they should feel confident the title is there for the taking.Maintaining Mohamed Salah’s and Virgil van Dijk’s outstanding form at opposite ends will be crucial to their chances, as will Klopp’s rotation of a midfield that offers great variety depending on the opponents. Fabinho’s emergence in recent weeks following his slow start has added an extra dimension, although the manager will hope there is more to come from another summer signing, Naby Keïta.Yet even though Liverpool’s lead is larger than that enjoyed by eight of the previous 10 sides to have topped the table at Christmas, City will feel they can force their way back into contention. Pep Guardiola’s side were 11 points clear at this stage last season and although they showed signs of vulnerability in the defeat by Palace, the return of Kevin De Bruyne could not have been more timely as they attempt to become the first club to retain the title for a decade. As well as that mouthwatering showdown in the first fixture of the new year City must also entertain Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal, with Manchester United the only side in the top six they have yet to face away.They can also take inspiration from the 2013-14 season when Liverpool were ahead of Arsenal on goal difference at Christmas but eventually missed out to City by two points after the famous 3-3 draw against Palace at Selhurst Park.Roy Hodgson’s side will have more of a say in this title race when they visit Anfield on 19 January and when City travel to Selhurst Park in mid-April, by which time the current top three will hope to have secured a place in the Champions League semi-finals.The first legs of those do not take place until the end of April, with the second leg early the following month, meaning any club involved in the latter stages of the competition must balance that with the last three rounds of Premier League matches, culminating on 12 May.Tottenham, due to face Liverpool at Anfield on 30 March, travel to the Etihad on 20 April and will fancy their chances of going all the way should they find themselves in contention by that stage.The evisceration of an Everton side expensively assembled by a number of managers over the past four seasons was the latest example of how Spurs have significantly overachieved in comparison with the rest of the top six. Emerging as the surprise winners of this blockbuster title race would be further confirmation of their manager’s considerable ability that has certainly not gone unnoticed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db2f337ace6fdfba1b1828b28bb2934f1ed0952/0_115_3446_2067/master/3446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6db33b05c25afcabe890ed5d1a8aa772","title":"rafael benitez newcastle miracle future mike ashley frustration","story":"Manager’s talk of ‘miracles’ and refusal to commit future indicate frustration with Mike Ashley has hit new levelRafael Benítez’s media addresses are often filled with pointed subtexts directed at club owners but even by his standards his latest comments were striking. When Newcastle’s manager said it would be “a miracle” if they stayed up and refused to commit to seeing out the season at St James’ Park, it seemed maybe, just maybe, he really has reached the end of his tether.After Saturday’s dismal 0-0 home draw against Fulham, Benítez looked as disillusioned as he has ever been since taking charge at St James’ Park almost three years ago. He returns to Anfield on Boxing Day effectively at war with Mike Ashley. “My focus now is trying to find the right team to play Liverpool,” was all he would say when asked whether he intended sticking around for the remainder of the season.Benítez has never been scared to challenge boardroom consensuses but he went further than normal, playing with fire. “We will be in the bottom half of the table for the whole season, and if we can be better than three teams it will be another miracle,” he said. “Even if we strengthen in January it will be a miracle.”It is the sort of comment which, in a different context, at a different club, could get a manager sacked and hardly sent out the most positive message to Peter Kenyon, Garry Cook or whoever’s consortium is supposedly the latest frontrunner to buy out Ashley and assume control of Newcastle in the new year.Benítez’s problem is that, for the second Christmas running, there is a sense that much excited takeover talk could well come to nothing, leaving Ashley still the owner and a skinny squad striving to survive.Newcastle’s manager wants to see the club prosper but he also needs to protect his reputation as one of Europe’s finest managers and, at 58, he is keen to have another crack at winning more of the game’s glittering prizes.As Ashley headed off on his festive holiday in the United States last week, his manager participated in a club transfer summit. It appears it did not go well, leaving his hopes of signing the £25m-rated Paraguay and Atlanta United playmaker Miguel Almirón severely diminished.Most regular Newcastle watchers would agree that he also needs a left-back, a winger and another striker and, after that draw with a Fulham side who spent £100m last summer, his comments were either about sending the owner a not-so-subtle message in the hope of forcing significant January investment or fashioning an exit strategy.Benítez is not a quitter and has never walked out on a club but he feels the £20m transfer market trading profit Ashley was so proud of last September is in peril of being consumed by the cost of relegation. It is plain he does not expect to collect many, if any, points from the impending trips to Liverpool and then Watford on Saturday before Manchester United visit St James’ Park on 2 January.The trouble is that by finishing 10th last season he overachieved and Ashley seems convinced Benítez’s coaching and tactical ability will keep Newcastle up.If Ashley may be angered by reading between the lines he should remember Benítez has always been brave when confronted by “strong men” owners. This is a manager, who, during a brief stint at Chelsea, used the aftermath of a fifth-round FA Cup win at Middlesbrough in March 2013 to tick off Roman Abramovich. Fed up with being abused by Chelsea fans, Benítez told journalists Chelsea had made a “massive mistake” in naming him as interim manager rather than manager. Many people were convinced he would be sacked the next morning but, instead, Abramovich let it pass, allowing him to win Chelsea the Europa League two months later, by which time they had also finished third in the Premier League.Benítez had taken a calculated risk by hurling a curve ball at Abramovich and he has done something similar with a different owner. Saturday’s provocative words carried an undercurrent of “back me or sack me”. Although Ashley is highly unlikely to do the latter the chances of the retail tycoon heeding his manager’s advice appear almost as slim.At Anfield two sets of supporters will chant Benítez’s name but when he waves to those wearing black and white some may see it as the start of a mutually painful farewell."},{"url":null,"title":"the 100 best male footballers in the world 2018 nos 100 71","story":"Our panel of 225 experts from 69 nations have had their say and Luka Modric has been crowned our No 1"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4031f152297160e6419137917a94e1ed81a73489/141_1187_870_522/master/870.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=bd3e72698b52c82ff7ea806858246d3a","title":"how to survive christmas one step at a time","story":"’Tis the season to be jolly grateful if you can get through it in one piece. Here’s a five-point plan on making it to New YearIt’s useful to have a scapegoat at Christmas so mine is the industrial revolution. Yes, the Victorians were responsible for the festive fever dream of Dickensian jollity we have all internalised, but it’s those damn steam and steel barons who allowed us to escape our families most of the year. Since we stopped spending our lives confined to one room with several generations of people seemingly put on earth for the sole purpose of annoying us, we’ve lost the knack of just tolerating our nearest and dearest, I think. As a result, when Christmas rolls around, our lack of practice, deluded belief that this is the time to forge heartwarming memories and the hysterical exhortations of Yuletide end-stage capitalism combine to ensure carnage.Because the perfect family Christmas is a lie, of course, the magic we strive to recreate is a nostalgic, eggnog-sodden amalgam of multiple Christmases, each awful in its own way (The Dead Dog One, The Norovirus One, The Disinhibited Dementia Granny One). Reality cannot compare, so we struggle to cope. I know a couple whose marriage guidance counsellor actually advised they acquire some cannabis to deal with the stress of the season (“a lot more Quality Street were consumed,” notes my correspondent, “but it was a Very Happy Christmas”).This year will probably be awful, too, but there is hope. I quizzed everyone I know on how they cope and – having weeded out “emigrate”, “put my mother in a B\u0026ampB”, “be Jewish” and “I hate literally everything about Christmas” (my son, ladies and gents) – present my findings here. Like those hour-by-hour planners that explain how to serve turkey and trimmings in perfect condition at the right moment, I’ll be applying a step-by-step approach to engineering peace on earth and goodwill to your Ukip uncle.The vision The soaring voices of boy trebles and dancing candlelight illuminating the darkness: a time of magic.The reality The last grainy chocolate-flavoured blob has been wrenched from its cardboard sarcophagus, but no one is tucked up dreaming of sugar-plums. What the hell is a sugar-plum anyway? Heston Blumenthal has probably reimagined them as gilded edible mini drones for Waitrose, RRP £31.99. Children, maddened by tinsel glare and months of aggressive advertising, are whirring themselves towards certain disappointment. Hissed arguments take place in corridors, which are also home to single family members, sleeping on a mildewed airbed wedged between the Hoover and a sweating, half-defrosted ham. Somewhere, someone is running a judgemental finger along your cornicing.Family fight flashpoint This is usually the point at which Parsimonious Parent discovers the pile of ruinous glittery rubble that Feckless Parent considers the bare minimum for a decent Christmas. That’s always a doozy.The plan7pm Count your blessings. In continental Europe, you’d already be heading into a smörgåsbord of Festen-style togetherness with no prospect of escape. My husband’s French family enters a confined space on the evening of the 24th with all the crustaceans, meat in jelly and alcohol in the world and they do not emerge until everything, or everyone, has been eaten. I’m pretty sure Sartre wrote Huis Clos about a French family Christmas.8pm Prepare for the morning: negotiate waking time rules with children old enough to respond to specific, convincing threats. Strips of that giant turkey foil over inadequate curtains helps bamboozle smaller ones.9pm Carve out some time alone. The John Lewis ad has it right: Elton John – no stranger to a meltdown – knows he needs healing solitude. I get mine by wrapping in advance then retiring on Christmas Eve with a hipflask and Cold Comfort Farm “to do the wrapping”. Use this time to set your intentions, as the hippies say: you won’t get wound up by sibling humble braggadocio or your daughter-in-law’s ostentatious undereating. You’ll be gracious about getting a novelty doorbell or an extractor fan. You won’t rage-eat a whole Brie at midnight.11pm Rest, for as long as possible.The vision An explosion of joy!The reality An explosion of plastic, actual children and emotion, if stocking chocolate is not swiftly removed.Family fight flashpoint Ingratitude, timing squabbles, my husband blithely loading a plate with the expensive Christmas salmon I was saving for lunch.The plan4.59am Your waking time rules have been disregarded but stay strong. Apply eye mask insert earplugs.5.59am The children are cooked: concede defeat at this point. Try to eke out stockings as long as possible: everyone takes it in turns presents must be examined, not tossed aside. Feckless Parent, er, Santa, selected each one with care and he would like some credit for this thankless act of love, please.6.45am Allow everything to chill. It’s too early for proper presents it’s too early for anything. Go back to bed, eat a metre of Jaffa Cakes or take the dog for a bracing pre-dawn walk. If you’re that person who likes filling a bin bag with every scrap of wrapping paper and packaging, knock yourself out.8am Get started on lunch. When surveyed, everyone volunteered something you should drop from lunch: forget pudding, use bought gravy, renounce turkey, go out instead. My concern is that once you start to pull at the loose thread of Christmas tradition, you’ll unravel and unravel until finally you are sitting on your own, naked, eating a baked potato (God, that sounds wonderful).Tradition is tyrannical but reassuring: give in to it and its supporters, who my friend Jane calls “Militant Christmas Protocol gene carriers”. Do what you always do: it requires the least mental bandwidth. Yes, doubtless Nigel Slater disagrees, but he’s not listening to your cousin describing the financing arrangements for his new BMW.That said, in our family, my stepfather’s usual MO of mechanically purchasing and single-handedly preparing a vast turkey most of us don’t eat à la mode de Delia Smith will face off this year against my teenage son’s newfound passion for muscular YouTube bro cooking perpetrated by earnest Brooklynites. Things will be deep-fried and powdered onion (what is wrong with you America?) will be liberally sprinkled, disrupting my stepfather’s robotic élan. It’s going to be interesting, interesting like a Chinese curse.9am If children are involved, this is as late as you can realistically do proper presents. Forget about displays of joy or gratitude. Have you seen brain scans of people on LSD, those colourful explosions of cognitive pyrotechnics? That’s your kids right now.10am Cooking continues. A word on the status of the cook: heed Nina Stibbe, whose excellent book An Almost Perfect Christmas relates her mother’s decades-long “grim personal quest” to cook a moist turkey. Treat the cook “like a demigod. Let them choose the telly and the music and let them pull the wishbone.” A bottle of something reserved for the cook’s exclusive consumption is also wise.11am Put enervated children to rest in a cool place: outside, ideally.1pm Start to gently baste restive older relatives in a snowball marinade. A light touch is recommended.The vision God bless us every one, a Tudorbethan tableau vivant of bronzed meats, spice and familial merriment.The reality The kitchen is dense with steam and fury, signifying disaster. “Can I…” someone says, dithering on the threshold, then retreats in terror. No one can help the cook is alone with his or her demons and 30 still-hard potatoes. One Christmas survey respondent related how she thought she had a fever, took her temperature and then realised she had actually parboiled her head with constant peering in the oven. Meanwhile in the dining room, a vegan, a gluten-eschewer, two rampant traditionalists and three poor sods who couldn’t give a rat’s chipolata what they eat are gathered, bored, paper crowns starting to split.The plan3 (or 4 or 9) pm There is nowhere to hide, people have imbibed at levels incompatible with good behaviour and the turkey wrangler may have cooked their own head. This is no time to tackle B****t, gender identity or co-sleeping. Instead, our indulged emperor children need to do their bit: make them dance for their numerous costly gewgaws. Embarrassing teenagers is a cross-generational pleasure so gang up and ask obtuse questions about sexting, facial hair, boyfriends and Fortnite. Smaller children are intrinsically erting and supply this service without even realising. They owe us that, frankly, so milk it to the full.The vision Replete and cosy, the family opens a few more thoughtful gifts then settles down to a film or a board game.The reality Lunch fizzles out as the endless winter night sets in in earnest. Discombobulated and sick of the sight of each other, we sink into brooding, dyspeptic torpor.Family fight flashpoint Boredom drives people to assess their gifts with the dour zeal of DCI Taggart, noting inequities, blatant regifting and passive aggressive deployment of charity goats.The plan5pm Gift amnesties or budget caps are sensible – none of us need more body lotion – but joyless. Let me suggest a small refinement. If someone in your family actually gives good presents, arrange to exchange one with them. Since our mum died, my sister and I give each other a decent gift and it’s lovely. My husband was raised by an in-all-other-respects-admirable woman, who gives you three towels on 12 November and calls them your “Christmas present”. He can’t be held responsible for my happiness on this special day.6pm Rest the human carcasses: nap time. The L-tryptophan in turkey helpfully induces doziness vegetarians and vegans must rely on the bone-deep exhaustion that comes from repeatedly defending their life choices to family members.8pm If you can’t physically remove yourself from the overheated miasma of obligation and sprout gas, travel in your imagination. Idris Elba would like to do your ironing a iel puppy needs a belly rub. There has been a grisly murder, no, a series of murders, in your family home.9pm Time to top up the collective marinade. Someone probably gave you an awful liqueur: open it now.11pm You think you are hungry. You aren’t, but it doesn’t matter. Bring out the Christmas cake, garnish with a roast potato and the remnants of the salmon wrestled from your spouse earlier, stand bathed in the cool glow of the fridge and eat a whole Brie.The vision The stress of the big day has dissipated and everyone can play with their toys in peace.The reality On his first Boxing Day as a sentient human and not a floppy shrimp, my son toddled expectantly to the tree looking for a new pile of gifts: no one had explained to him Christmas was a one-off thing. The hours of furious misery that followed were simply an unvarnished version of what we all feel: crushing anticlimax.Family fight flashpoint I can only admire the energy of anyone who has any fight left in them at this point.The planAM Somewhere near you a group of men – it’s always men, don’t @me – is indulging in something stupid and dangerous, such as swimming in the sea in fancy dress, or crawling through barbed wire and sewage. Convene a family outing to go and heckle.PM Nothing much is happening nothing will happen for days. During these listlessly unspooling hours of nothingness, take a moment to look tenderly on your family as they go about their various weird occupations (fiddling with the thermostat, boiling dishcloths, arranging their gifts in flat lays for Instagram). They are your weirdos: cherish them and add this moment to your mental album of festive lies, sorry, memories. And remember: thanks to the industrial revolution, it will all be over soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b72efc704814533ae1a0a69f687e6c6989c0a9e/0_325_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=215012d47e0f6c49ea4524df9d294457","title":"16 stories of jesus in honduras","story":"From a political prisoner to a garbage picker, and a bereaved mother to an activist, photographer Sean Hawkey reveals the poverty and violence rife in Honduras through the stories of men and women named JesúsManuel de Jesús Bautista Salvador, 22, was arrested by military police (PMOP) in Naco, Cortés, in the north-west of Honduras, for breaking a curfew during the 2017 protests against the re-election of President Juan Orlando Hernández.The government responded to the opposition demonstrations with military force and a 10-day curfew. By the curfew’s end, Honduras’ National Human Rights Commission said 14 civilians had died in protests since the election, and 1,675 people had been arrested.On 3 December at 7.30pm, Manuel de Jesús Bautista Salvador was detained, along with a friend. They were beaten, pepper-sprayed and taken away with two others who were already in the police patrol vehicle. At a checkpoint, Bautista Salvador jumped from the vehicle and the other detainees heard shots.The other men were released the following day but nothing has since been heard of Bautista Salvador. Despite petitions by the Honduran Committee of Relatives of the Detained and Disappeared, he is still “disappeared”, and there has been no investigation into his whereabouts.Jesús García of Santa Elena, La Paz, spent 17 months imprisoned because of his activities as a Catholic lay preacher.“When my father was assassinated my mother looked at how she’d been left with no help. She got sick and just died. One of my brothers was disabled. He also died of pneumonia. The rest of us survived somehow. I was orphaned quite young, so I couldn’t study. We all had to work to survive.“I was a political prisoner because I was a lay preacher. I coordinated 180 other preachers in Santa Elena and Yarula and Nahuaterique. Our priests asked us to speak the truth, and that’s what we did.“They came at two in the morning to take me. There were a lot of soldiers. They smashed up everything in the house.“At first no one knew where they’d taken us. We were disappeared. At that time lots of people disappeared for ever, or maybe they’d find your body in a ditch. It was dangerous. A lot of people died like that. Our families were asking the army to give us back, at least to hand over the dead bodies.“Central America has a lot of martyrs.”“I don’t know how old I am,” says Jesús Lorenzo Martínez of Ojo de Agua, La Paz. “I’m on my own. Bringing my children up on my own is a struggle, a battle. I had six children but two are dead. Two boys died. They weren’t for me, they were for God. One went when he was a month old.“My kids are like me, they are as big as me now, and they will have to struggle like I’ve struggled. Sometimes I sleep with a flower, and I feel like the boys are with me and I feel strong.”“I live here in Los Altos de Corralito, where I was born, high up in the mountains,” says Jesús Pérez. “I plant corn and beans, and sometimes I earn some money working as a labourer.“I have six living daughters, and two living sons. Our community has a history of struggle for land and for recognition of our indigenous identity, and my family has paid dearly for it. Blood has been spilt for our rights.“The Maya Chortí communities were marginalised by the big landowners, but thank God, now we have official recognition as an indigenous people, and we have a little bit of land. We’ve been here for thousands of years, but we only got recognition in the last 20.“My nephew was Cándido Amador. He was two days older than me. He gave his life for our cause. They assassinated him. He had long hair, he dressed in indigenous clothes, and had very indigenous features. “…They thought that Candido was the leader and that’s why they assassinated him. He was beaten, he was cut with a machete on his hands, his neck, his head, and he was shot three times in the chest. And they scalped him. It was the night of 11 April 1997. He lived in my house, so they came here to get me to identify the body. He had been thrown on the side of the road.“One of my own sons is buried next to him. He had a fall while he was working in the town, and died of the internal injuries later. We put flowers on both the graves at the same time.”Fausto de Jesús Vásquez, of Los Patios, La Paz, met his wife in the fields.“She would bring the food to us when we worked, I saw her, and I fell in love with her. We had two children.“I was born in Nahuaterique which was in El Salvador – now it is in Honduras. We have double nationality.”(Nahuaterique was part of an international border dispute between El Salvador and Honduras that was resolved by the International Court at the Hague in 1992, when it passed to Honduran administration.)“I’m dying. I am surrounded by my family. My children live nearby. Here nature is abundant, it’s good for maize and beans, coffee, yuca. I worked with vegetables too – tomatoes, cucumbers, to sell.“We saw a bit of everything in that time, in the war. We lost everything – the house, all our things. But they are material things, you can get all that again. Life is what you can’t get back if you lose it.“We rebuilt everything after the war.”Jesús died peacefully at home earlier this year.Jesús Ángel Vásquez lives in San Marcos de Sierra, Intibucá. “I am in fifth grade. I live with my mum and dad. I have three brothers. I’m the oldest one.“I get up at two o’clock in the morning. I go to wash. My mum does good tortillas. My favourite food is rice. Sometimes we don’t have much food. I’m hungry.”Jesús Salazar, Suyapa, Pespire is the coordinator of an organisation for the defence of human rights.“We need to defend the water. It’s scarce here in the south, and it’s our life. We depend on it to live.“In 2003 we began to hear these promises, that the road was going to be improved and the church would be built, if we let the mining company in. The municipal authorities, our representatives in the National Congress, they all supported it. They promoted it.“But, that’s not development for us. That’s the sale of our territory to transnational companies. It’s against our will and against our interests. They can always find an ally in the communities – people who will help them. They give them some money and brainwash them, but these people bring long-term difficulties for our communities, which will affect our children and grandchildren. It will poison them and rob them of water. We need to be very clear about this – they are bringing death.“They came here with an environmental licence … But because we were already organised, there was a defence. We have 19 groups organised in the villages around here, and we have lawyers. We won’t let them in.“They’ve tried. There have been confrontations and injuries. Twice those rats have come here with their machines. They even came at Christmas because they thought it’d be easier.“They came one evening when we were planting corn. There weren’t many men here. Everyone was in the fields planting. Women with babies stood in front of the excavators to stop them coming in. Then, with mobile phones, we mobilised more than 300 people to come quickly with machetes and sticks, and we stood in front of the machines and we all raised our machetes in the air. The men they sent were thugs, but they left.”María de Jesús Pérez Vásquez, from Las Flores, Lempira, is 92.“I had three of my own children – two boys and a girl. I spend most of my time in the house nowadays, with my daughter-in-law and grandchildren.“There’s no one else my age around here. The secret to a long life is to rest enough but not too much, eat as little as a child eats and work hard. I still like to make tortillas, though my fingers are getting stiff now.“My parents didn’t have money to send me to school, but I learned a few things. I worked as a midwife for 60 years. I delivered a lot of babies, attended a lot of women in birth. Everyone here knows me. Women still bring me little gifts to say thank you. When I walk down the road, most of the people I meet – I saw them arrive in this world. I was the first person to hold them.“My husband was a drunk. He died of a hangover in a field 12 years after we got married. I brought up the children on my own.”Jesús Martínez, from Santa Elena, La Paz, says he doesn’t remember how old he is.Jesús’ son, who is also a Jesús – Jesús Martínez Vásquez – shows us some multi-coloured corn they are saving for seed, open-pollinated, indigenous varieties.“These are seeds that are passed down from generation to generation. Farmers have done this for thousands of years. We save the seeds from the best heads of corn, then we plant them again, when the moon is right, and we’ll get a good harvest of strong corn like the harvest before, as long as it rains.“We grow black corn, yellow and white, and mixed. We know that the seeds from here like our mountain soil. Corn has grown here in these mountains for hundreds of years. The first problem with the commercial corn seed is that you have to buy them. Well, we don’t have the money. It is very productive, but only the first year, then the second year it’s weaker. It’s so weak it’s not worth saving the seed for the second year.“If you want to keep on getting the big hybrid yield, then you need to buy more seed the next year, and the fertiliser and the insecticide. And if you don’t keep your indigenous seeds, then you just have to buy the hybrid seed. So, the best thing is to grow at least some indigenous corn, and keep the seed, or you end up dependent on the seed companies and giving your money to them. Anyway, this is what we use for the tortillas. We eat these with beans, an egg, avocado. We grow two types of beans here, a tiny one and chinapopo. That’s a tasty bean.”María de Jesús Gabarette is from Tierra Colorada, Lempira.“My husband died. He hanged himself, here in the house, with a rope. When he used to get drunk I’d be afraid. He’d be really drunk sometimes and he’d shout at me, telling me off for going to church. Sometimes I’d just leave the house and sleep somewhere else, or I’d sleep with a knife under my pillow.

Lots of women get killed by drunk and violent husbands.

And I’m training to be a midwife.”Yolanda Jesús Lozano works on the municipal dump in Rio Abajo, Tegucigalpa.“Two weeks ago they found a head here, half eaten by the vultures. They say they found the body over in Comayagüela.”Jesús Alberto Ramírez, lives in Sinaí Chimichal, Copán.“Sinai is a holy place. It’s where Moses got the 10 commandments. Chimichal is a tree that grows here. That’s why we called this place Sinaí Chimichal. We’ve been here since 1991.“We organised ourselves because we’d been enslaved by the landowner. We weren’t allowed to plant food to eat, or to put up a fence around our huts, or to wash clothes in the stream. They just made us work for whatever they wanted to pay us, and they’d treat us very badly.“Organising ourselves was hard on everyone. My brother, Nicolás Ramírez, was shot in the belly and killed. The rest of us were captured, tied up with rope and taken to prison. After 20 days or so I was let out, but I was captured and sent to prison again. Our friend Rufino was also shot and captured and sent to prison without medical treatment.“Negotiations took place, and eventually we were given about 30 acres to plant food and build huts. And here we are.“We’ve suffered a lot of poverty here. Most of the families here have lost a child. But since we’ve been able to plant food it’s a lot better and not so many children have died.”Jesús Alberto Mayorga Lemus, from Copán Ruinas, says his parents couldn’t afford to send him to school.“So I decided to learn a trade to earn some money. I learned carpentry and I went to work. I was 13. I didn’t get paid for three years. My shoes were broken and I had patches in my trousers. It was hard. When I was visiting my girlfriend I had to hide the holes in my shoes by putting my foot up behind me.“I’ve suffered, but you learn from suffering and you can use it to become better – a better son, a better brother, a better friend, a better husband. Without God, we aren’t anything.“I fell in love and got married when I was 16 and a half. We had four children.”Jesús García Hernández, is from Los Horcones, Valle.“The drought has been going on for 10 years. It’s due to climate change. Winters were good before. But now we’ve had years without water. We’ve got dry streams, rivers and wells. We lose our seeds and fertilisers we even lose our hope sometimes.“There are families here who haven’t had a harvest for 10 years. We’ve all just lost another harvest. We prepared the soil, put in the seeds and fertilisers and, when the first bit of rain came, the plants began growing. Then the rain stopped. Then the rain came again but it was too late. After 10 years of drought the people here have used up their reserves and there’s desperation.“We’ve had to deepen the wells, but they still dry up. The water is going down.“A lot of people have left. Some go to work in other places as labourers or security guards or cleaners. And some risk the journey to the States. What else is there to do?”Emanuel de Jesús Barrientos lives in Comayagüela.“I knew I was gay when I was six years old. I’m 33 now, the age of Christ.“In Honduras many gay men suffer discrimination. They are attacked, even killed. It’s dangerous to come out of the closet as it puts everything in danger – your family, your social relationships, your work, your security, even your life. We live in an aggressive environment of violent heterosexual machismo.“I work promoting LGBT rights and I study at the university too. In our offices we are obliged to have a security system with cameras and rolls of razorwire as we’ve had threats.“We have a proposal for a law for gender identity and equality. Through this law we would have a legal basis to prohibit all sorts of discrimination for sexual orientation, race, ability, age and gender identity.“There are gender equality laws in other countries but, of course, with this government there’s not much chance of seeing it passed in Honduras. A lot of people are opposed to the movement for equality. They think the only thing we want is equal marriage and the right to adopt.“Two years ago I tried dressing as a woman for the first time. I feel it allows me to express a feminine side of my character that I can’t while I’m dressed as a man. I don’t walk down the street like it, but I do it for LGBT events, like a show. It’s a bit of fun.”Jesús Hernández has joined the migrant caravan, pictured here on the road to Oaxaca out of Arriaga, Chiapas: he is wearing the NY baseball cap. As the image above was taken, federal riot police blocked the road for a few hours.

For an increasing number of festive fun-seekers, however, taking part in an organised activity during Twixtmas – which kicks off on Christmas Day and finishing on New Year’s Day – is now as much a part of the calendar as the Queen’s speech or getting irate with your relatives.On Christmas Day thousands of swimmers, many of them donning their bathers for charity, gathered for icy dips in places from Tenby to Torquay or met up for the annual yuletide park run. Large-scale ball games of Uppies and Downies, a sporting endeavour with varying rules, kicked off in a towns including Workington in Cumbria and Kirkwall in Orkney, where it is called the Ba’ game. And should you be lucky enough to find yourself in the picturesque Cotswolds this Boxing Day, it would be near criminal not to take part in the famous Bibury duck race.So why are so many people taking part in slightly oddball pastimes over the Christmas period? Ella Foote from the Outdoor Swimming Society says the number of people ready and willing to take a icy dip before the end of the year is growing year on year.“It’s definitely become a huge thing, and attracts a lot of people that only do it at this time of year,” says Foote, who has been raising money for the mental health charity Mind by taking a cold-water dip every day this month. “For swimmers particularly it’s become a really social thing, Christmas dinner tastes a lot better if you’ve swam in cold water in the morning.”The members-only Christmas Day swim in the Serpentine, Hyde Park, London, now has to be limited to 70 participants for safety reasons, says Robin Hunter, the president of the Serpentine Swimming Club. The swim has taken place since 1864, and carried on throughout all the war years. “Whether trying to raise sponsorship or visibility for their activity, we do it because a bunch of people started 150 odd years ago and we’re keeping up the tradition,” he says.A festive run has also become quite normal. Five years ago there were 101 Christmas Day park runs, but this year there were 400. Three-mile park runs are weekly event across the UK. Andy Evans, the event director of the Tring park run in Hertfordshire, says about 100 runners came to the first Christmas run four years ago, but that this year he is expecting 250.“Lots of our runners come week after week, so it feels natural to see them on Christmas day,” he says. “Particularly for people who might be on their own at Christmas, and who won’t get a family visit it is an event to go where you will see your wider social family.”Boxing Day events include two duck races in Bibury, where thousands of plastic ducks race under the village’s bridges to raise money for charities and the local cricket club. It’s all very jolly, says Terry Day, the founder of the event and the cricket club’s groundsman. “It’s very popular and the club put on mince pies and mulled wine. We have visitors from around the world, but it’s great to see all the villagers come together.”It’s a bit of fun, but a big event in the village’s calendar, says Virginia Ryselyte, the reception manager at the Swan hotel: “It’s a lovely family day, but oh my goodness it gets competitive.”Other events are a bit more rough and tumble. The Ba’ game in Kirkwall, Orkney, involves the whole town split into two teams –the Uppies and the Doonies. The Uppies have to get the ball to a marked wall high up in the town, while the Doonies try to get it to the harbour. Teams can be up to 100 strong and the game, which dates back to at least the late 19th century, draws about 1,000 onlookers, according to Charles Tait, a local photographer who has an exhibition chronicling the history of the event on at Kirkwall’s Old Library.A Ba’ game bookends the festive period for Orcadians, with the final match held on New Year’s Day. If it sounds like a lot of effort from the comfort of your sofa, it is – but it’s worth it, says Tait. “It’s taken very seriously. It’s far more important than Christmas dinner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29bf84f7f9c0ee1a3e9fa6311725dec260b5bc4d/0_0_2101_1261/master/2101.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=608bd7aeba718e35cb06dab701d3185d","title":"people of 2018 childish gambino music this is america choreographer","story":"The Rwanda-born dancer, who grew up in south London, helped create the most talked-about video of the yearWhen I got the call from Donald Glover’s manager, asking me to choreograph his video, I didn’t know much about him.

I moved to the UK in 1999 when I was five years old, and grew up in south London: West Norwood, Crystal Palace and I think possibly Clapham at one point. I went to Stagecoach classes and my school specialised in performing arts, but I didn’t do any African dance – just standard stuff like contemporary and modern. It was only after going back to Africa – Uganda, South Africa, Rwanda – and feeling the vibes and the culture, that I got into it.

She has done nothing wrong, has broken no laws. The charges against her are completely false.“She is innocent and should not be kept in prison, separated for so long from her family and her young daughter. While she’s imprisoned, Nazanin continues to suffer both physically and mentally.“We, and indeed the whole country, know what a travesty of justice it is that Nazanin continues to be detained. Her case, and also those of other dual-nationality prisoners being wrongly held in Iran, have rightly attracted global interest and deep concern.Nazanin was not the only innocent Londoner to be incarcerated in Iran: “London is home to a large Iranian community who make a valuable contribution to this great, erse city. Together, we are united in calling on the Iranian authorities to release Nazanin immediately along with the others who are being wrongly detained, to allow them to return home and be reunited with their loved ones.“With Christmas approaching and, as Nazanin turns 40 on Boxing Day, we are calling on the Iranian authorities to release her at once so she can return home and be reunited with her family.”The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, pressed his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Zarif, about Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case when they met in New York in September on the fringes of the UN general assembly.The director of Amnesty International UK, Kate Allen, said: “What should have been a day of celebration for Nazanin will once again be a day of anguish, her third birthday behind bars. Despite everything, we send Nazanin our warmest wishes.“Nazanin is a prisoner of conscience who should never have been jailed in the first place. The UK government should continue to press for Nazanin’s release using every channel of communication available to it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdc8b84c8b29dfe548d32a7205694ba968b8f803/0_194_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=740\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a67b5a7ad32a7975e437514f12cf55c8 740w","title":"political figures celebrate paddy ashdowns energy bravery and humour","story":"Praise for politician who transformed Liberal Democrats and oversaw peace in the BalkansTributes have poured in from across the political world and beyond for the former Liberal Democrat leader and ex-marine, Paddy Ashdown, who died on Friday night, aged 77, only two months after he revealed he was being treated for bladder cancer.Ashdown will be best remembered for transforming the Liberal Democrats into an effective third party – gaining their best ever result at the 1997 election – and for serving as the United Nations’ high representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina from 2002 to 2006. He oversaw the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement, which has kept the peace in the Balkans since the Bosnian war.He was praised by politicians from across the spectrum after news of his death emerged.Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said it was “a hugely sad day” for the party and everyone else across politics “who had immense affection and respect for Paddy”. He saluted a man who “was famous for his politics, but his talents extended well beyond that arena”.Theresa May said Ashdown had “served his country with distinction”, adding: “He dedicated his life to public service and he will be sorely missed.”Jeremy Corbyn said his thoughts were with Ashdown’s family and friends. “He represented Yeovil very well and I got to know him in the 1980s when we often found ourselves voting in parliament together against damaging government policies,” said the Labour leader. “He will be greatly missed.”The former prime minister David Cameron said he had “seldom known a public servant with so much energy and dynamism” and that “the UK, liberal democracy and rational, moderate, cross-party debate have lost a great advocate.”He said Ashdown was “a passionate and charismatic leader and brilliant communicator, never more so than when he championed the Balkans and appealed to governments of the day to do more in the 1990s.” Lord Kinnock, who led the Labour party for part of Ashdown’s time as Lib Dem leader, said he was “brave in his military service and in his political thinking and action” and had “imagination, tenacity, great enlightened instincts and a fine self-deprecating sense of humour.Ashdown became the first elected Liberal Democrat leader in 1988, stepping down in 1999. He served as the MP for Yeovil from 1983 until 2001, before receiving a peerage and entering the House of Lords as Baron Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon. He continued to contribute regularly to agenda-setting political programmes throughout his later years and was a familiar face in the upper house.He was a pioneer of cross-party collaboration and well known for rejecting tribal politics. He was an ardent pro-European and tireless campaigner. The former prime minister Gordon Brown called him one of the “towering political figures” of his generation.Brown described him as “a strong European, a committed internationalist and a dedicated constitutional reformer”. He added: “Paddy Ashdown had boundless energy, was prepared to cross party lines and served not just his own country but the international community, with great distinction, as a representative of the United Nations.”Jeremy Bowen, the BBC Middle East editor, said how much respect he had for Ashdown, paying tribute to to his actions in his UN role during the 2000s. “During the Bosnian war most politicians pontificated from a safe distance,” he said. “I would see Paddy when he came into besieged Sarajevo across a risky mountain route. He used his own eyes and ears to work out the war’s rights and wrongs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/045f1ff227e943977bcbedee86b135f2cb88aa69/0_100_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3b3a299dfadb62a855147773d514d72","title":"paddy ashdown a political life in pictures","story":"A look back at some of the public moments of the former Liberal Democrats leader, who has died aged 77"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fed1f679c9bf04d0e9fee20af840be96e030ed97/0_423_3869_2321/master/3869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=146b3a6790978a853e311df0b979a940","title":"tell us how are you defying expectations about ageing","story":"If you’re still living life to the full at a time when many people expect you to be slowing down, we’d like to hear from youAre you in your 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s or older?

Not just saying ‘hi’ or waving to the neighbour but actually saying ‘how are you doing, how are things going?’“Having a little chat. Checking in on people in more than a trivial way. As a healthcare professional, we always feel like we spend our days doing good stuff, but this is about being a good citizen and part of society.“In a world where we’ve got more connection by social media than ever before, we also hear and see other people are less connected with somebody that can hold your hand in a time of trouble.”In January, Theresa May described loneliness as a “sad reality of modern life” for too many people, as she announced a range of measures including the appointment of a minister with a brief to lead the government’s response."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f1d37a6cc002359cd4168b59635662028532352/0_0_5139_3085/master/5139.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb1b428e49c379c5e7f5551213ab9a2f","title":"genetic study eating disorders treatment","story":"Researchers explore whether genes and early eating habits may trigger disordered eatingResearchers are trying to identify the role genetics and early eating habits play in conditions such as bulimia and anorexia.Eating disorders, which often arise before adulthood, have been increasing in recent years and about a quarter of young people report having symptoms, according to MQ: Transforming Mental Health, a research charity.By pinpointing often-ignored factors, researchers from University College London, funded through the MQ Rosetrees Fellowship, aim to help identify disorders at an early stage, prevent them from developing and inform new treatments, such as drugs that target appetite.Previous studies have focused on psychological risk factors, such as body image and self-esteem, but the UCL research team, led by Dr Clare Llewellyn, is taking an alternative approach.She said: “In the field, what’s been talked about more is the social things, the extent to which the parent talks to the child about the child’s weight and their own weight and whether their parents have eating disorders. What we don’t know is the child’s own traits and predispositions.”The study aims to build on research, some of it conducted by Llewellyn, which examined the influence of genetics and childhood eating patterns on obesity. Anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness and such conditions cost the UK about £15bn a year.Llewellyn said since the completion of the human genome project in 2003, researchers have been trying to identify genetic code associated with variation in weight. They have been successful in narrowing down the genes in parts of the brain that control appetite, which is determined by satiety and responsiveness to food cues – taste, smell and sight.“Most people don’t realise the extent to which your appetite is controlled by the brain, rather than something we just learn,” Llewellyn said.She is working on the hypothesis that some of the code that underpins genetic susceptibility to disordered eating is similar to that already identified as affecting body mass index. If that is the case, it could pave the way for early detection through screening programmes.The second strand of the study will explore how parents’ feeding practices affect children’s eating habits during adolescence. Llewellyn said researchers were not seeking to blame parents for potentially harmful strategies but were instead trying to identify those which were optimal.“We are trying to look for parental feeding practices that predict a really healthy relationship with food – plus genetic susceptibility and how that affects appetite – to try to identify the best strategies parents can use to help their child develop a healthy relationship with food,” she said.Researchers will analyse data from twins whose mental health, genetic and parental factors have been tracked from birth through to their teenage years.“There is a huge dearth in funding into mental health research, especially in eating disorders. This leaves too many people without the information and support they need. The potential of this project is significant, from informing parents on health eating practices through to setting the stage for the development of new treatments.”"},{"url":null,"title":"thomas bjorn golf ryder cup tattoo backside promise","story":"Thomas Bjørn has kept his promise to have Europe’s Ryder Cup-winning score tattooed on his backside.

I remember the thrill of participating in the carol singing when I was a child. I was regularly cast as an angel in the nativity plays on the streets of my hometown, Uzhhorod in western Ukraine. South of Kiev, the open-air Pyrohiv Museum of Folk Architecture and Life showcases the traditions of Ukrainian Christmas among old village houses and windmills. On 7 January the museum recreates a typical Ukrainian rural Christmas celebration with carols, food tastings and a church service. For a more urban experience, St Sophia’s Square in central Kiev holds a procession of Bethlehem stars.Pavlo FedykovychLike most people living in Paris, I start my festive season with the réveillon, France’s traditional Christmas Eve dinner, which begins around 9pm and carries on into the early hours. Anyone visiting the city can easily join in the Christmas celebrations, because markets and shops stay open all day on 24 December, with most people, myself included, frenetically buying provisions for the evening meal. This year may be different because of the gilets jaunes protests but whether they’ll disrupt the Christmas break remains to be seen. I live near the Bastille, so tend to shop at Le Marché d’Aligre, a street and covered market that dates back to 1779. Fishmongers prepare giant plateaux de fruits de mer: oysters, crabs, prawns, mussels and whelks on a mound of crushed ice. There’ll be a long queue outside the cheesemonger – try the delicious creamy Mont d’Or – but fortunately it has a pop-up bar serving craft beers. The bakery rapidly sells out traditional bûche de Noël, a rich chocolate log. For a well-earned holiday drink with friends, choose between a mint tea at the stallholders’ fave hangout, Le Penty, or join the chic shoppers tucking into freshly shucked oysters and chilled chardonnay at Le Baron Rouge. If you’re on a night out, there are plenty of classic brasseries – such as Bofinger, 100 metres from Place de la Bastille– serving Christmas cheer.John BruntonThe Catalan equivalent of the Christmas morning walk and drink at the pub is a stroll along the beach before stopping for a vermut – fortified wine infused with herbs and spices that, when poured over ice with a slice of orange, is Christmas in a glass. Espinaler – 20km out of town towards Mataró in Vilassar de Mar and going strong since 1896 – is always convivial, but never more so than on Christmas morning. Locals come for breakfast or lunch, and clink glasses with friends and neighbours around marble-topped tables fuelled on house-made conservas (canned cockles, razors clams and mussels, sardines, anchovies and olives) and olive oil-fried crisps with top-secret Espinaler sauce. If you don’t fancy that, its salt cod fritters, Russian salad and patatas bravas are excellent too. If you do, it has several Christmas hampers filled with ready-to-serve conservas and vermut (from €9.95 for the mini version) on offer this yea. Tara StevensSince moving to Sweden in 2012, I celebrate Christmas a day early. The 24th is a day of julbord (buffet of herring, gravlax, meatballs, ham, red cabbage), big fires, and Tomte (Swedish Santa). For the 25th I’ve adopted my Swedish wife’s tradition: we head to Sundhammar, a tiny public beach on the west coast. If it’s cold enough, we can skate on the frozen sea (not something I ever imagined doing growing up in the East Midlands). There will be other families there skating or walking their dogs, and the water is shallow so perfect for low-risk fun. The beach is raw and natural – no gift shops or toilets – but the views are spectacular. After skating we’ll fit in a walk along the pinkish granite rocks, a picnic of leftovers and hot chocolate, and a 3pm sunset over the archipelago. Then we head home to build up the fire again, nurse our bruises, and sleep off the festive food.Will Dean is author of Red Snow, published by Oneworld on 10 JanuaryMy first encounter with Icelandic Christmas traditions was at a farm I was staying at in northern Iceland some years ago. Arriving on 23 December – St Thorlak’s Day, a day celebrating the patron saint of Iceland and the last day before Christmas – I was presented with a feast of putrid skate and potatoes, a traditional meal consumed on that day. But, with the help of some ice-cold Brennivín (Icelandic schnapps), I managed to finish the plate of gelatinous fish and felt like I’d passed a significant cultural challenge. Over the years I’ve even come to enjoy it. Despite the strong smell of ammonia, a result of the fermenting process, the delicacy is popular, and restaurants where it’s served get booked up quickly. As far as the chefs are concerned, the stronger the stench the better: if it makes you cry and clears your sinuses, you know it’s good. Fortunately, it doesn’t taste as bad as it smells.• Skate buffet lunch from £33 at Fish Company, Vesturgata 2a, Grofartorg, Reykjavik (open on 23 December)Lisa ShannenFor a nation that is probably the most atheist in Europe, the Czechs do love a good Christmas crib. Before the Christmas carp is scoffed, many locals – myself now included – pop into their local church to gawp at the year’s ffering. These nativity scenes – betlémy – have been big business in Czechia ever since Holy Roman Emperor Josef II banned them in 1782, prompting the poor to make rebel papeer maché versions in protest. In Prague, there are good ones at the Church of St Ludmila and Church of St Antonin, but for a mega-nativity-scene fix, the Church of Our Lady of the Snows has its own mechanical nativity, and houses 200 others, made from cardboard, metal and, er, gingerbread. The church is on Jungmannovo náměsti 18 and open 10am-4pm on on 24 Dec (10am-6pm other days).Mark PickeringAs I wandered home late at night on 23 December before my first Christmas in Naples several years ago, it looked like all hell had broken loose in the narrow streets of La Pignasecca market. At every corner, fishmongers in blood-splattered aprons, with knives in hand, were wrestling with live eels on chopping boards. Frenziedly working against the clock, they were preparing enough of this Christmas Eve treat, known as capitone, for every family in the neighbourhood to enjoy the next day. At La Pescheria Azzurra, my favoured fish stall, matriarch Carmela, who overseas more than 20 workers, saw me as I looked on aghast. “Will you be taking your capitone home dead or alive?” she asked. If I had replied “alive”, I would have had to take my eel and keep it in the bath before knocking it on the head with a hammer just before cooking time on Christmas Eve. Neapolitans believe the eel is the embodiment of Satan, so although the cheap and filling capitone is less than appetising, eating it on Christmas Eve has remained symbolic, akin to devouring all evil itself. But there’s no need to kill the fish yourself: Carmela will pluck one straight from a vat behind her stall, to be chopped into small chunks, deep-fried and served on plastic plates (from €10).Sophia SeymourMany Norwegian families hunt for their perfect Christmas tree in their own forest. Last year the task was given to me. I have six siblings, who all have partners and kids, and we celebrate Christmas Eve at my mother’s in Naustdal, a picturesque fjord village. My thick outfit would have made Arctic expeditioners jealous. My saw and axe would have scared polar bears, had there been any they live further north. I was followed into the snowy woods by a curious cat and two nephews. Sverre wanted spruce Miguel preferred pine. We settled on a juniper. Lights, Norwegian flags and ornaments made by nieces made it look … decent. The kids were more interested in the parcels underneath anyway, while the adults indulged in cloudberry cream.Note: Cutting trees in others’ forests is illegal, find a tree farmer.Gunnar GarforsBowls of bright red halászlé typically kick off Christmas Eve feast (a bigger occasion than Christmas Day) in Hungary. This spicy “fisherman’s soup”, teeming with chunks of freshwater fish and enlivened by hot paprika, was traditionally prepared in cauldrons over fires by men who fished in the Danube and Tisza rivers. Each recipe is different: some call for noodles, others for dollops of cooling sour cream. Straari Restaurant, in the Aria Hotel Budapest (Hercegprímás u. 5), for instance, offers a version for Christmas Eve lunch with catfish, trout, and caviar (around £6.50). Other classic holiday dishes include breaded carp fillet, stuffed cabbage rolls and the poppy seed-laden puddings mákos guba and beigli. The latter are cylinders of yeast-raised dough often given as gifts at Christmas. Snag one at any cukrászda (confectioner’s) or supermarket for a sweet immersion into Hungarian ritual.Alia Akkam• This article was amended on 24 December – Ukrainians celebrate Christmas with a meal on the evening of January 6.

Evil Archie Mitchell being bludgeoned by a statue of Queen Victoria. Zainab screaming as the B\u0026ampB burned down. This is the stuff that classic Christmas Day EastEnders is made of. Over the years, the soap has delivered some of the season’s most vital moments. Forbidden lust. Untimely death. And in a particularly vintage year, Christmas Day would feature a Virgin Mary-style birth, such as that time when Bianca had a baby on the floor of the Queen Vic.Dirty Den kicked off the golden age of ding-dong drama when a now-unthinkable 30 million people in paper hats watched him demand a orce from his poodle of a wife Angie, his eyes leaking hatred as he delivered his speech. The Mitchell bruvvas continued the tradition with weddings, knees-ups and orce after the time Grant discovered Sharon had been polishing both his and Phil’s shiny heads.Walford earned its reputation as a highly entertaining pit of festive doom from the 80s to the 00s. In the glory days, the Christmas period was prime bumping-off time: Pauline Fowler collapsed after a face-off with Sonia Jamie Mitchell’s spleen gave way and Tiffany was run over by Frank Butcher, making him basically responsible for launching Martine McCutcheon’s pop career. A perfect moment indeed.Classic Christmas EastEnders can also be less in your face. Who could forget the most uncomfortable scene in soap history (no, not Frank Butcher naked except for a spinning bow tie): it was between Trevor and Little Mo? The way the hideous bully drowned her Christmas dinner in gravy then forced her face into it is etched on the mind of every soap viewer. That episode was everything an ’Enders Xmas should be: powerful, haunting and acted to perfection.The last great EastEnders Christmas was in 2014, however, when Mick Carter went full Danny Dyer’s Deadliest Men and smashed up the Queen Vic after finding out Dean Wicks had raped his wife Linda. Shirley topped it off with a “He’s your bruvva!” revelation. If that isn’t back-to-the-80s Christmas ’Enders, then what is? It was a climax as sharp as Ian Beale’s festive swan napkins.Anything after that was going to be a letdown. The following year saw the “Who killed Lucy?” plot hanging around like five-day-old turkey curry. Only the lovable (but disposable) Fatboy was killed – and that was by mistake. Soon, the most Walford could muster was a power cut, Dot’s cat pooing on the carpet, and – shockingly – a cheery singalong. New lows were reached with a Christmas bin day debate. (Yes, really. Eat your hearts out, Den and Angie.) EastEnders hasn’t been in such a state since the disturbing Kat and Ronnie baby swap, which was wisely cut short.But lo, there is a glimmer of hope this year. Gruesome twosome Ian and Jean are stuffing more than the turkey Kat Slater is teetering on the brink of discovering Alfie’s love child and Mick’s out of prison just in time to get proper naughty.

America’s Donald Trump, Russia’s Vladimir Putin, China’s Xi Jinping, and a rogues’ gallery of like-minded, second-tier authoritarian figures around the world used their positions to advance national and personal interests at the expense of universal democratic, legal, environmental and human rights.The arbitrary behaviour of these powerful men produced strange and daunting paradoxes. The American economy expanded, even as a US-China protectionist tariff war restricted global free trade. Europe marked the 100th anniversary of “the war to end all wars” amid fears of new conflict with Russia. Nuclear-armed states shredded key arms control pacts while ostracised Iran fought to save one. The furore over the murder of a lone Saudi journalist created more headlines than multiple human tragedies in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.Peace broke out between North and South Korea, Ethiopia and Eritrea, in South Sudan, and in Spain’s Basque country, where ETA disbanded – but Palestinians and Israelis traded harsh blows, marking 70 years of strife. The climate change crisis was better understood than ever. Yet the international response was handicapped by political isions, rendered more febrile by a 12-year scientific deadline to save the planet, reported worldwide declines in flora and fauna, and extreme weather events such as California’s wildfires.On a more optimistic note, in Malaysia, the good guys won for a change, toppling a corrupt leader and proving that hoards of jewellery and Hermès handbags do not guarantee happiness. The #MeToo movement continued its powerful backlash against predatory and domineering males. A black American actor married a reddish English prince at Windsor Castle. The England football team surprised everybody by reaching the World Cup semi-finals. And Canadians, perhaps hoping to get away from it all, legalised cannabis.Adventures in crazytownDonald Trump again dominated the news agenda in 2018, mostly for the wrong reasons. His intolerance of criticism, arbitrary decision-making and bending of the truth set the tone for anti-democratic, authoritarian strongmen around the world. Trump became America’s first “rogue president”.Trump’s sinister attempts to intimidate what he called the “fake news” media raised fears about democracy and free speech. He used his Twitter commentaries – random, inaccurate and sometimes libellous – to distract attention from his failings, such as his enduring problem with women.When Trump’s supreme court pick, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of sexual misconduct during Senate confirmation hearings, Trump responded by denigrating the principal accuser, Christine Blasey Ford. His blatant misogyny polarised the country – a trademark Trump effect.Trump himself faced multiple claims of sexual misconduct. Ex-porn star Stormy Daniels provoked embarrassment and derision with an unflattering description of the presidential penis. Trump’s legal troubles deepened as his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, talked to prosecutors and confessed to a string of crimes, including campaign finance violations that directly implicated the president. Trump continued to accuse the special counsel, Robert Mueller, of conducting a witch-hunt – but did not dare fire him. By year’s end, Mueller’s net seemed to be closing.The US midterm elections handed a sharp rebuke to Trump. The Democrats’ “blue tsunami” of 40 gains in the House of Representatives suggested congressional scrutiny of Trump’s activities will increase exponentially in 2019. Trump’s cynical pre-poll claim that a Central American migrant caravan threatened national security failed to stop the rout.The impunity of PutinIn Russia, Vladimir Putin was re-elected president in a rigged poll that allowed no other result. Putin ensured his domestic dominance by hounding critics such as opposition leader Alexei Navalny. He used Russia’s hosting of the football World Cup in June to further entrench his position. Putin nevertheless faced nationwide resistance over state pension changes, and his popularity fell amid mutterings about high-level corruption.Putin purposefully projected Russian power abroad, conducting a large military exercise with China, probing Nato’s defences in the Baltic and North Atlantic, and using disinformation campaigns to influence elections in Europe and the Balkans. Russia’s military seized Ukrainian naval vessels off Crimea, sparking fears of a war involving Nato. It also helped Syria’s dictator, Bashar al-Assad, regain control of most of the country.Trump’s fawning attitude to Putin, intensified speculation that the Kremlin holds compromising information about him. Even after Russia was proved to have mounted a chemical weapons assassination plot in southern England, and was punished with additional western sanctions, Trump avoided direct criticism. For his part, Putin ridiculed his accusers.Xi Jinping for everChina’s leader consolidated his hold on power following a decision by the National People’s Congress in March to abolish terms limits – effectively appointing him president-for-life. The Communist party tightened its control over civil society groups, the media, the internet, and academic and religious institutions. Challenging the government became a more perilous activity than ever.Xi’s zero tolerance of dissent was symbolised by the harsh treatment of Muslim Uighurs in western Xinjiang province. Reports detailed mass incarcerations in “re-education” centres, ostensibly to contain a threat from Islamist extremism. Human rights defenders and pro-democracy activists suffered repression in Hong Kong.Like Putin, Xi stepped up an aggressive drive to expand China’s global reach. The militarisation of several artificial islands in the South China Sea was completed. Xi tightened Beijing’s diplomatic siege of Taiwan. These moves produced dangerous confrontations with US forces conducting “freedom of navigation” patrols.The other dictators and demagoguesThe top-down trend favouring “strongman” leadership accelerated around the world. In Brazil, a hard-right nationalist, Jair Bolsonaro, survived a knife attack to win the presidency and was embraced as a kindred spirit by Trump. Bolsonaro’s focus on development intensified worries about the despoliation of the Amazon.A UN report demanded the Myanmar junta of General Min Aung Hlaing be investigated for genocide and crimes against humanity over its persecution of Rohingya Muslims.In Bangkok, an authoritarian ex-general, Prayuth Chan-ocha, prepared to oversee elections – amid fears the polls would be rigged or postponed again.In Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, Hugo Chávez’s incompetent successor, presided over large-scale misery. Millions fled to neighbouring countries to escape deepening poverty, terrifying crime rates and political misrule. In the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, emulating Trump’s America First rhetoric, admitted he had ordered extrajudicial killings.In North Korea, the country’s ruthless, ever-grinning dictator, Kim Jong-un, was bolstered by a summit with Trump in Singapore. Trump claimed a breakthrough on nuclear disarmament – but in practice, Kim stuck to his guns.The year saw the emergence into full public view of another autocratic Trump ally – Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince. Salman had presented himself as liberal reformer, graciously allowing women to drive. But then came the murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul of a leading critic, US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Turkey and the CIA claimed to have conclusive evidence that Salman ordered the killing.The claim was furiously denied. But Prince Mohammed’s credibility lay in tatters. Trump worked shamelessly to defend his protege, but his inept White House statement succeeded only in appearing to condone the murder.The Saudi crown prince symbolised the type of unscrupulous, authoritarian and anti-democratic leader who came to the fore around the world in 2018. Their emergence was an augury of an even more dangerous development: a breakdown in international law and the slow collapse of the global order."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03c4d331b6a3a81c0fa3354dc5f059b4acd908a9/0_152_5712_3428/master/5712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11c58085216e58b703d47b6fc5beca11","title":"statue of libertys original torch gets a new home","story":"Lady Liberty’s light was replaced in 1985 but the original is now to grace a new $100m museum – they just had to get it thereWhen Larry Sidoti’s grandparents came to America from Italy after weeks at sea in the early 1900s, they were first greeted by the Statue of Liberty.“The joy that they felt – they were ecstatic and very cautious, because this was a totally new life for them,” Sidoti told the . “My grandfather had said to me, a number of times, that she stood for freedom, and stood for opportunities.”More than 100 years later, Sidoti was on Liberty Island as Phelps Construction Group’s general superintendent, supervising the move of the statue’s original torch into its new home – a $100m, 26,000 sq ft museum on Liberty Island, which is set to open in May.The beginning of the torch’s journey to this venue can be traced back to the 1980s, when the Statue of Liberty underwent a huge restoration to mark its centenary.Due to decades of exposure to the elements, Lady Liberty’s torch needed to be relocated indoors, experts had decided. New York City’s salty, moist air, an explosive attack on a nearby munitions depot in the first world war and the windows that had been cut into the torch to make it more like a lighthouse had all exacerbated its fragility.“This was changing the history of this great icon,” said Stephen Briganti, president and CEO of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, adding that “it seemed to be beyond repair”.After the torch was lowered on 4 July 1984, it was covered and stored on Liberty Island – only making an outing to appear in the 1985 Rose Bowl parade before going on display in the statue’s pedestal. A replica torch was placed atop the statute in November 1985, according to the foundation.After September 11, safety protocols capped daily visitors to the pedestal’s interior at 4,500, meaning only a fraction of the island’s visitors – up to 25,000 a day in peak summer months – were able to see the original.But when the foundation decided to build a new Statue of Liberty Museum on the island, officials were presented with a way to solve the problem.Moving the 3,600lb artifact safely presented a challenge, however.Tons upon tons of construction equipment required for the project had to be shipped to Liberty Island via barges that were then moored at temporary docks built for the project.The ornate, weather-worn metalwork at the base was made of copper “the thickness of a penny,” Sidoti said. “If you were to just touch that copper work on anything, it would bend and be pretty much destroyed.”“It’s like a huge Tiffany lamp,” he said. “You know the care that you’d take when you’re handling even a small office-type Tiffany lamp? You’ve gotta understand, this Tiffany lamp is 12ft in diameter and 16ft high.”The torch was first moved into the statue’s pedestal through a trench, but a foyer with doors had since been built, meaning there wasn’t enough clearance to just slide it out along the floor.“The real challenge was, ‘OK, can this physically fit out?” said Doug Phelps, who heads Phelps Construction Group.The torch first had to be disassembled into two pieces – the flame and the base.The team had to reinforce the structure otherwise, “it would just implode on itself”, Sidoti said.Phelps’s team spent countless hours consulting with historians and restoration contractors before the pieces were ultimately lifted apart with a spider crane set up in the pedestal.The gap for clearance was just one-and-one-half inches, but “it did fit,” Phelps said.A trailer – the kind used to transport space shuttles – took the pieces across the island, along with a replica of Lady Liberty’s face, to the museum about 600ft away, where another crane inside the new museum reassembled the torch. The move took place over two days in November and required an on-the-ground crew of 15 people.“The first thing that went through my head? I’m going to have a really good night’s sleep after two years of worrying about this thing,” reflected Sidoti of the move’s successful completion.“My son is 42 years old my daughter is 38 years old – they were in awe of the project from the beginning,” said Sidoti, 67. “My grandsons are 10 and 6, and I had them out on the project.”“I’ve taught my children what the price of liberty is, because I got to learn from my grandfather, and my father who was in the second world war – we passed it down to the next two generations,” said Sidoti, who served in the US navy.“My parents have passed away, but I know they’re watching, and I’m sure I can feel the smiles on their faces just knowing that I worked on this project.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee491f0a933c4fdba468832828378066bb6393b2/0_99_4442_2665/master/4442.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=542de85ebfbabdff81579d5446601add","title":"pope francis uses christmas homily to decry modern consumerism","story":"Archbishops of Canterbury and Westminster address nation’s ‘uncertainty’ as pope describes differences as ‘a richness’Faith leaders in the UK have warned in their Christmas messages about uncertainty and ision in the country.Introducing a Christmas morning service from Lambeth Palace, broadcast on BBC Radio 4, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, said people may be feeling “unsettled” and wondering what the next 12 months would bring.He also spoke of the plight of refugees, rough sleepers being “ignored by almost every passerby” and “those on the margins and those disregarded”.Later, at a Eucharist service at Canterbury cathedral, Welby called for the language of love to replace the “languages of hatred, tribalism, rivalry, materialism, pride, greed, and so many more”.Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster and the most senior Catholic in England and Wales, told a congregation at midnight mass on Christmas Eve that “we are in difficult times, times of uncertainty and an absence of consensus”.Churches were providing help on food poverty and homelessness, he added, but more volunteers were needed.“If, in the coming year, hardship increases, then we are ready to help in every way we can,” Nichols said.In recent weeks, Welby has spoken of the need to “calm down the hatreds” over Brexit, and for reconciliation and restraint.He repeated his view that, although he voted remain, the outcome of the referendum must be respected. Reconciliation takes time, he told ITV.“It involves regret and repentance, it involves acknowledging where things went wrong, where you went wrong, where the other went wrong, it involves truth seeking, it is a process that is cautiously piled layer upon layer upon layer until you’ve built this bridge across the gap.”In Rome, Pope Francis described differences of faith, race and ideas as a richness, not a danger, and called for political solutions to end wars in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere.Addressing tens of thousands of tourists, pilgrims and Romans who flocked to St Peter’s Square, Francis, who turned 82 this month, said that without fraternity, “even our best plans and projects risk being soulless and empty”.He called for that spirit among iniduals of “every nation and culture” as well as among people “with different ideas, yet capable of respecting and listening to one another”.“Our differences, then, are not a detriment or a danger they are a source of richness,” Francis said.He made his appeal as the trend toward nationalism, which has fuelled suspicion of migrants and refugees, has gained traction in much of Europe and the US. In his Christmas Eve homily, the pope had attacked the “insatiable greed” of today’s consumerism, urging people to make “sharing and giving” more a part of their lives.“Mankind became greedy and voracious,” the leader of the world’s 1.3 billion Catholics said in an address to thousands of followers in St Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City.“In our day, for many people, life’s meaning is found in possessing, in having an excess of material objects.“An insatiable greed marks all human history, even today, when, paradoxically, a few dine luxuriantly while all too many go without the daily bread needed to survive.”The birth of Christ pointed to a new way to live “not by devouring and hoarding, but by sharing and giving”, he said.

Can I manage without all these unnecessary extras and live a life of greater simplicity?”﻿As Francis presided over celebrations in Rome, the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, was in Iraq to celebrate Christmas with the Chaldean Catholic community, a clear sign of the pope’s solidarity.Catholics are among the religious minorities devastated by Islamic State-inspired violence that has driven tens of thousands from their homes in Iraq.Parolin met the Iraqi prime minister, Adel AbdulMahdi, on Monday in Baghdad.The Vatican has for years expressed concern about the exodus of Christians from communities that have existed since the time of Jesus.This year, Francis joined Orthodox leaders to decry what he called the “murderous indifference” of world powers to violence and suffering in the Middle East."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4b51dfc51d63faf988b31d82688a1f3f6b8e57c/160_385_2335_1400/master/2335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff4e4d6e409f21b6f3b5b40528422c27","title":"british iranian academic detained in iran since april returns to uk","story":"Abbas Edalat of Imperial College London had been held on ‘security charges’ A British-Iranian dual national academic and anti-war activist who was detained in Iran has been released and returned to the UK.Abbas Edalat, a professor in computer science and maths at Imperial College London, had been held in custody since April, according to the Centre for Human Rights in Iran.Iran’s official IRNA news agency had reported that Edalat was being held on unspecified “security charges”, raising parallels with the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has been held on spying charges for more than two years, charges she denies.The UK Foreign Office has frequently said other British-Iranian dual nationals have been held in Tehran but not identified them in line with family wishes.The Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran (CASMII), which Edalat founded, said he returned to the UK last week. Edalat, ironically, had been a campaigner against US sanctions against the Iranian regime, and his detention appeared to be based on a misunderstanding.The group said it appeared he had been detained due to “misinformation and misunderstanding by the Iranian security apparatus”.In a statement it said: “It increasingly appears, as we had suspected, that his detention in spring in Iran was a case of misinformation and misunderstanding by the Iranian security apparatus.“In the context of the multi-pronged attacks and open threats of the US, Israel and their allies to destabilise the Islamic Republic of Iran – including massive spending on economic warfare, espionage, and psychological operations against Iranians – the tensions are rising again and the potential for such misinterpretations is very real.“CASMII continues to demand that the US call off its threats, destabilisation campaigns and sanctions on Iran and rejoin the internationally recognised UN-endorsed 2015 nuclear deal with Iran (JCPOA).”A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: “We can confirm that a British-Iranian dual national who was detained in Tehran has returned to the UK.“We continue to take action on all our consular cases in Iran in line with what we believe will produce the best outcomes in their cases.”Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been in prison in Iran since April 2016, accused of seeking to overthrow the Iranian regime. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, this week made a renewed appeal for her release ahead of her 40th birthday on Boxing Day.The British-Iranian mother, who works for the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini airport.The charity worker, of Hampstead in north London, was later sentenced to five years in jail after being accused of spying, a charge she vehemently denies. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has made her release a linchpin of British-Iranian relations, but has been unable to find a lever to persuade the Tehran regime to release her.The UK feels poorly rewarded by Tehran for its efforts to stand up to the US over President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal in 2015.Ratcliffe, and the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, have called her incarceration a “travesty of justice”.Hunt tweeted on Christmas Day: “Happy Christmas to all. As we celebrate, let’s also remember those unjustly imprisoned like Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe who is 40 tomorrow and separated from her brave husband Richard and devoted daughter Gabriella. Many more like her – we will not forget them today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/822fdd6602dfb424ecdd87a3119de98fbb52ba7c/0_203_5464_3279/master/5464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d29306adb2ccb7f3f25ad18d3fe44c75","title":"going solo japanese businesses target customers who want to be alone","story":"Eighteen million single households help spawn their own industry, from karaoke booths and ramen bars to bowling alleysAt the the multi-storey Karaoke Kan in the Shimbashi district of Tokyo, it doesn’t matter if you fail to hit the right notes during your rendition of Danny Boy or Never Gonna Give You Up. Likewise, there’s no need to reassure your friends when they murder a classic hit.That’s because Karaoke Kan is one of a growing number of Japanese businesses catering to ohitorisama, or the solo customer. Inside your karaoke booth for one, no one can hear you scream.The rise of singledom has spawned its own industry – catering not just for the 18 million Japanese living alone, but also for married and cohabiting people who crave time away from their partners, workers who want to escape from colleagues during their lunch break and, yes, amateur crooners struggling with their falsetto.All are united by the desire for temporary liberation from peer pressure that, according to some experts, has been exacerbated by the demands of social media.“Our data shows sociable iniduals tend to seek solo activities,” Motoko Matsushita, a senior consultant at the Nomura Research Institute, told Agence France–Presse.The trend is being fuelled in part by changes in Japanese society created by the decline of the traditional family unit, in which two, and often three, generations lived under the same roof.Government data shows the ratio of households with parents and children is gradually shrinking as fewer adults form long-term relationships. In 1980, just one in 50 Japanese men had never been married by their 50th birthday, and one in 22 women. Now that status applies to one in four men and one in seven women.Few places in Tokyo encapsulate the solo lifestyle more than Ichiran, a chain of ramen restaurants where diners eat alone, largely uninterrupted by staff and out of sight of their fellow diners.At the restaurant’s Shimbashi branch, interaction with other humans was kept to a minimum when the  visited.The first step was to buy a ticket for a portion of ramen from a vending machine. Then, a flashing blue light indicated a seat had become available at the far end of a counter ided into 10 booths by wooden partitions. A member of staff appeared, placed a bowl of steaming noodles on the table and lowered a slatted blind as he walked away. With just enough elbow room either side to manipulate the chopsticks, customers ate in near-isolation. The ohitorisama phenomenon isn’t confined to dining out and singing karaoke. An array of businesses, from bowling alleys to travel agencies, now welcome solo customers in settings that traditionally cater to groups. They can reserve partitioned seats at cinemas and jump the queue for popular rides at theme parks. “Businesses are offering various goods and services in response to the trend for people to enjoy activities alone,” Matsushita said. “The depth and range of these services is a reflection of the expanding nature of that trend.”At Karaoke Kan, there was time for one last song before the hour-long session ended.  settled on the 1970s Eric Carmen hit – All by Myself – but soon realised that something wasn’t quite right because for one precious hour on a freezing afternoon in a city of almost 14 million people, the song’s chorus, “don’t wanna be all by myself”, couldn’t have been further from the truth.

The future of the international coalition remains unclear.The foreign minister also criticised the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who has said French forces will remain in Kurdish-held Syria as a buffer.“If France is staying in Syria to protect the YPG, that will neither benefit France nor the YPG,” he said, referring to the main Kurdish militia in Syria, adding that Turkey would take its cues on the matter from Washington, rather than Paris.The White House confirmed Çavuşoğlu’s announcement that Trump has received an invitation to visit Turkey in 2019, although no date has been set for the trip.The two Nato allies have come to an agreement on several issues that have ided them in recent years – chiefly, US support for Kurdish-led militias in Syria, and Turkey’s two-year-long detention of US citizen, pastor Andrew Brunson.Brunson was released and returned to the US in October after a Turkish court suspended the remainder of his sentence for terrorism offences related to the failed 2016 military coup.It is widely believed the catalyst for the sudden detente is the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this year. The US has sought to insulate its partners in Riyadh, including Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, from blame in the case.Erdoğan alleges that the “highest levels” of the Saudi court were responsible for ordering Khashoggi’s death.Turkey, along with other countries, is seeking a UN-led investigation into the unsolved case, Çavuşoğlu added on Tuesday."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Knights of St Columbanus serve three-course meal to homeless families and those in needFrancis sends Cardinal to Iraq to celebrate with the country\u0026rsquos long-suffering ChristiansSanta will be breathalysed before journey to make sure he is well under legal drink-flying alcohol limitThis year marks 60 years of unbroken UN peacekeeping service for Defence Forces\u0026lsquoNobody is listening, they keep building dormitories,\u0026rsquo says homelessness campaignerLiterary correspondent critically injured in single-vehicle crash 4km outside Drogheda\u0026lsquoGrand oasis in the big vastness of space\u0026rsquo: \u0026lsquoEarthrise\u0026rsquo captured by Apollo 8 astronaut\u0026lsquoDon\u0026rsquot stand around chatting in your togs\u0026rsquo: Practical tips from Irish Water SafetySome 36 applications for return of a child were made from Ireland last year.

Video: Enda O\u0027Dowd\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThird generation fruit and vegetable wholesaler Justin Leonard believes Simon Coveney’s no-deal Brexit plans are “disingenuous” and too little too late.  Photograph: Enda O’Dowd“The problem is nobody knows,” says fruit and vegetable wholesaler Justin Leonard about what kind of Brexit there might be, hard or soft, and what either might mean for his business.Leonard is the fourth-generation of his family to run Jackie Leonard \u0026amp Sons, a 126-year-old fruit and veg wholesaler, Dublin’s oldest. Brexit could have a major effect on Irish fruit and veg importers such as Leonard and others in the Fruit Market in Dublin’s north inner city.Some 90 per cent of the fruits Leonard sells come from Europe and at least 50 per cent of the vegetables are sourced from mainland Europe or the UK. Even 20 per cent of his potatoes come from the UK.“If we have a hard Brexit, all our product we source in Northern Ireland – mushrooms, cooking apples from Co Armagh, juices – they are all going to become non-EU products,” he said.“It is not going to be a case of jumping in your car and coming down the M1 across the Border from the North. Nobody knows what will happen. Nobody can legislate for what will happen.”Leonard says the Government cannot say for certain what they may or may not be implementing yet to prepare for Brexit, and there are fewer than 100 days until the UK leaves the EU at the end of March.He believes Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is being a “little disingenuous” by saying that the purchase of land at Dublin Port by the end of March would “solve the problem of a backlog of trucks”.“We are in the 11th hour and suddenly everyone is saying, ‘Let’s put a plan together’. It doesn’t happen like that,” he says.He is concerned that customs clearance agents, who mostly vanished with the disappearance of borders in the 1990s with the opening of the EU single market, will not return in time to deal with Brexit.“We are not going to suddenly materialise customs clearance agents overnight and definitely not by March 31st,” he says.Fruit importers fear what customs checks might mean to the fruit and veg being brought into the country on the backs of trucks and the effect of a possible return of days-long delays at borders.Philip Fitzpatrick of Caterway fruit and veg wholesalers says restrictions on the UK land-bridge route to Europe would mean taking the longer, direct ferries, which face a greater risk of delays from stormy weather.“We are hoping there will be some kind of deal, obviously, and we will be able to keep the land bridge. But if there is not, we will have to look for a direct ferry,” he said.In this business, quick deliveries are everything longer journeys mean possible rotten produce.“You are talking about fresh products, and if it is delayed, it goes off,” said Maurice Lawlor, who has been working in the family business J\u0026ampN Lawlor Fruit Merchants for 42 years.“The quality of the product when it hits the shops might not be as good as what it is now.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

But is that reasonable?In 2017 Liam Fox famously claimed that concluding a trade deal with the European Union after Brexit would be the “easiest in human history” because we’d start from a position of already being fully aligned on tariffs and regulation.Such bullishness is notable by its absence now.Indeed, one of the reasons Brexiteers are so alarmed by the Irish “backstop” provision of the withdrawal agreement is that even they doubt that there will be a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU in place by January 2021\u0026nbspwhen the transition is supposed to end.But what are the prospects for trade deals between the UK and the rest of the world after Brexit? What deals could we strike with the likes of China, India, Brazil and other emerging markets?A glance at the international trade secretary’s Twitter feed\u0026nbspshows he remains upbeat on such prospects. Is this warranted?The answer is that it will depend\u0026nbspto a significant extent on what sort of trade deal the UK can get with the EU.Brexit is a mess, so why are MPs not postponing their Christmas break?Other countries are very likely to wait until they see how close we end up to the EU’s single market and the customs union before deciding, as that will impact the cost-benefit calculation of any bilateral UK trade deal for their firms and industries.If we end up closely aligned on customs with the EU that might limit our government’s autonomy to even forge independent trade deals on goods with third countries since we could be imposing the EU’s common external tariff.What about services? Well, presuming we’re out of the single market, that would give us more scope for services trade deals. And it’s true that services are a large and growing share of UK total exports.Yet the problem here is that international trade deals in recent years have been essentially about goods, rather than services.Another snag, at least from the perspective of sovereignty-obsessed Brexiteers, is that a service deal worth having would entail some degree of regulatory harmonisation, for instance recognising each others’ professional qualifications. Is that “taking back control”?Associated to that question is immigration. “A big ask of emerging markets when it comes to trade deals is UK visas for their nationals,” says Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform.That may not go down well with those Brexiteers who want less immigration from developing countries, not more.Finally, there’s “gravity” to think about. It’s an empirical reality that countries tend to do more trade with big economies that are closer to them than those that are further away.Even if we did successfully forge goods and services trade deals with lots of emerging market economies the results might well be disappointing to Brexiteers, like Fox, who have assumed big increases in trade flows.It’s for this reason that almost all Brexit modelling exercises, including the government’s\u0026nbspone, show only a modest gain to UK GDP in the long term from hypothetical post-Brexit trade deals with the rest of the world, with the damage far outweighed by the macroeconomic costs of introducing trade frictions between us and the EU.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But how could it look under a no-deal Brexit?Items that are grown in the UK won’t be affected, but those that are imported will become more costly as they will be subject to tariffs and other expensive trade barriers.Parsnips and carrots Let’s start with the good news. Parsnips and carrots are grown in abundance in the UK. They are available throughout most of the year and are rarely imported from abroad. So even a Brexit as hard as a raw parsnip is unlikely to affect this popular Christmas side dish.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialPeople with the Brussels sprouts-hating TAS2R38 gene are out of luck. Brussels sprouts are so abundant in the UK that they are actually exported around the world. The topical Christmas cracker joke, “How will Christmas dinner be different after Brexit? No Brussels” is unlikely to be true for the actual vegetable.These are the least recyclable Christmas chocolate wrappersAlthough the UK is a major potato producer, some potatoes and potato products still get imported to meet UK demand. This mainly applies to frozen or processed potato products such as frozen fries. Due to a large harvest in 2016-17, the UK is expected to be a net exporter of fresh potatoes in 2017-18. Fresh potato imports have been predominantly from EU countries, but traditional suppliers such as France appear to have found other markets. UK fresh potato exports are predominantly to the EU (98 per cent).So as long as growing conditions are favourable, there ought to be sufficient fresh UK potatoes to roast for Christmases to come.It is thought that sweet chestnut trees were brought to Britain by the conquering Romans and, like many other immigrants, they have naturalised and become an important part of the food chain. In most years\u0026nbspthe nuts grow to a reasonable size in the south-east of England. But in other areas it is unusual for more than one of the fruits in each husk to reach full size. They are generally not harvested in time for Christmas, but can be preserved by boiling and freezing.The fresh chestnuts you see at Christmas in the UK are mostly sourced from elsewhere in Europe. This is because sweet chestnut trees in the UK are threatened by both fungal blight and, more recently, the oriental chestnut gall wasp.If having reasonably priced quality fresh sweet chestnut imports is important to you at Christmas, Brexit could be a problem.Created with Sketch.

He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off – namely Emma Thompson’s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman.There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don’t expose it to the light, don’t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act “like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company”, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked.Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK – it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since – it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone’s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining. But it’s also warm, funny, timeless, life-affirming, and a deserved classic.When Tim Allen’s Scott Calvin accidentally kills Santa Claus (a nice, light-hearted beginning to a family film) he is expected to take his place.

They also make a good option for retaliatory tariffs against the US, the world’s largest cranberry producer. The EU took more than 50 per cent\u0026nbspof US cranberry exports in 2018, with the UK leading the way.That is not to say the UK does not have its own cranberries. The two native cranberry species in the UK are vaccinium oxycoccos (the northern cranberry) and vaccinium microcarpus (the small\u0026nbspcranberry). Wild harvesting used to take place in Scotland but, due to habitat loss, this is no longer done. As a consequence, the cranberries bought in UK stores are the species vaccinium macrocarpon. These are harvested in North America and Eastern Europe using a method that involves flooding the land, which is impractical in the UK.Vaccinium macrocarpon is also grown commercially on Terschelling, an island belonging to the Netherlands. The Netherlands is also a global trade centre for fresh fruit and vegetable imports and exported about €6m (£5.4m) worth of cranberries in 2017 (many of which were grown elsewhere).So the availability of cranberries in the UK is largely dependent on shipments from the EU. This supply chain arrangement may have to change after Brexit, particularly if the UK were to decide not to follow EU trade legislation. Depending on the flavour of Brexit, the costs of establishing a new supply chain independent of EU trade hubs and losing the economies of scale that the EU enjoys as a whole could lead to shortages initially and increased costs in the future.The majority of UK families opt for roast turkey on Christmas day. This will cost them more if there’s a hard Brexit.Turkeys are becoming more expensive to produce in the UK. Turkey producer Kelly Bronze’s prices, for example, are up by about 5.4 per cent\u0026nbspthis year and it has warned that a hard Brexit will affect its business by 70 per cent.A significant cost of producing turkeys in the UK is related to the labour cost of hand plucking. This relies on EU migrant labour and staffing for the Christmas peak and is a real concern. Brexit scenarios considered by farmers’ groups indicate that any deal affecting\u0026nbspthe labour pool is likely to lead to increased prices.For those not paying a premium for hand-plucked turkeys, any Brexit trade deals imposing tariffs or import restrictions on cheaper turkeys from the EU would not make them cheaper for the consumer. A trade deal with the US might provide the option of turkey meat marinated in chlorine – not necessarily to everyone’s taste.Strasbourg attack: Is it safe to visit Christmas markets in Europe?Elderly woman cuts down flashing Christmas lights in middle of nightCassetteboy remixes Die Hard to prove it’s a Christmas filmThe average number of turkeys slaughtered in the UK per week in December 2017 was half a million birds or about 2 million over the month. Allowing for the additional 1.6 million from November, the figure is still more than 6 million short of the estimated 10 million consumed at Christmas.Pigs in blankets The cost and availability of sausages wrapped in bacon is dependent on pork supplies. British farmers currently produce only 40 per cent\u0026nbspof the pork eaten in the UK. The other 60 per cent\u0026nbspcomes from EU countries such as Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands.So, as with turkey, a hard Brexit would lead to a rise in the cost of sausages and bacon due to either import costs or supply and demand issues.Christmas might only come once a year but Brexit is likely to make it even more expensive.Hana Trollman is a PhD researcher at Loughborough University.

He was holding a print-out of the draft of an article I’d written. “You did law, didn’t you,” he stated. It was true, my degree was in law. I nodded.\u0026nbsp“What’s this?” He asked, pointing to his desk. “It’s a desk,” I said. “Well f*****g well say so. Don’t say, ‘it’s got a flat top and four legs, and therefore might be a desk.’ It’s a desk.”I can’t tell you how often I’m reminded of Bambridge’s words. There is hardly a day that goes by when I don’t see a piece of writing or hear a speech that is pure verbiage, and can only have been produced by a lawyer or a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe latest example is particularly shocking. When I last looked, BT was supposed to be a communications company. Okay, telecommunications. But a corporation, nevertheless, that ought to pride itself on directness and speed of delivery. In that context, the ability of the receiver to comprehend should be paramount.\u0026nbspUnited Airlines mocked for corporate speak response to passenger rowSo, take this, from BT as it promises to overhaul its pay policies after the investor backlash following the £2.3m package handed to departing boss Gavin Patterson. The company will consider “a broader range of performance factors and wider circumstances” when determining executive remuneration. It also pointed to “a more structured process to help it step through the application of its discretion in the future.”Eh? Who writes this stuff? Clearly, not someone who believes in telling it how it is, and is unable to say something for definite without suffocating it in qualification. That has to be a lawyer, or as I say, a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe problem with this approach is that it suggests an organisation that is hidebound, stricken with fear, unable to proceed without a high degree of caution, incapable of saying “we screwed up, and we’re sorry”. Patterson received too much –\u0026nbspperhaps not under the strict terms of his contract –\u0026nbspbut, given the company’s poor showing, too much.\u0026nbspDecisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out.But BT cannot admit that, oh no. It won’t try to claw back the money as that would be unseemly, and besides, the lawyers have probably advised that would be difficult. Instead, it attempts to sooth and gloss over with words straight out of the lawyers’ lexicon of “safe” twaddle.\u0026nbspSlight as it is, in the overall picture of a multi-billion pound global empire, BT’s announcement about leaders’ pay is indicative of a loss of way, a lack of confidence. Intuition has succumbed to process.\u0026nbspWith any management there should be room for both, for the heart and the head. Of course, things have to be done properly and carefully, but they also need to be done. Decisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out. It is not the answer.Too often, I’ve seen the lawyers rule the roost. On a product safety issue, where fatalities had ensued, they were reluctant to let the management meet the relatives and express their condolences, because this could lead to an admission of liability. In another episode, involving a food company, they took the same line. Again, after a tragedy, a holiday operator was told on no account to contact the family.\u0026nbspWhile lawyers may give their advice for the best of intentions, to avoid the client being shredded in the law courts, and having to pay out vast sums, they do not afford enough attention to that other court, the one of public opinion –\u0026nbspand the one that these days, especially with instant relaying of news, 24-hour bulletins and social media, is increasingly vital.\u0026nbspThere’s little point in shoring up a legal defence, in cloaking a company’s actions in legal procedure and its outpourings in law-speak, if it simply makes the company the subject of derision, and harms its reputation.\u0026nbspSurely\u0026nbspit’s not beyond the wit of any intelligent C-suite member to say they share the loved ones’ pain, without stating there and then, it was the company’s fault? Likewise, is it really impossible for BT to say it recognises, and is concerned about investors’ frustrations, and will do its utmost to prevent a recurrence?Ask any business chief what keeps them awake at night, and they will say loss of reputation –\u0026nbspto the business, and to them, personally. It’s humans who determine how they and their organisation are judged, the basis for that\u0026nbsp reputation. Be human in everything they do, is the easiest way of achieving plaudits. That means being human in how they communicate, and in their actions.\u0026nbspPlease BT, in future, before you press “send”, stand back and read what you’re about to convey. Listen to the lawyers, but, remember, you’re human and you’re talking to humans.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

A redesign sets out to show that to consumersClick to followThe IndependentWorkers at Suma in Elland, YorkshireWhen Sheree Hatton started working at the whole foods distributor Suma six years ago, she knew it was different to anywhere else she’d ever worked.Hatton lives in Halifax with her husband and young son. In her previous job in advertising and sales for a newspaper, she was\u0026nbspused to a hierarchical business with targets for workers. Suma,\u0026nbspa worker’s co-op where each employee owns a share of the business, offered her a chance to have a say in everything from overall strategy to day-to-day operations.\u0026nbspEating organic food lowers risk of certain cancers, study suggestsCould co-operative shops be the answer to expensive organic foods?Organic food healthier than farmed products, says new research“I knew Suma was different from what I had been used to,” Hatton says. “But the more I learned about co-ops, the more I realised that by feeding into business decisions\u0026nbspyou have an equal opportunity to say how the business should be run.”Suma is known as the largest whole food distributor in the UK. But fewer people know that Suma is also Britain’s biggest workers co-operative, with an annual turnover of £55m. More than 200 people now work at Suma after rapid growth in the last few years.\u0026nbspAll of them are considered equal. Every worker at Suma is paid the same salary of £33,000. They get the opportunity to work in every part of the business – including the canteen kitchen – on rotation at the company offices in Elland, Yorkshire. And they get to vote on business decisions. “We are an equal business and we’re very proud of what we’re doing here,” Hatton says.\u0026nbspBut customers, like Hatton, often aren’t instantly aware of Suma’s co-operative status or what that means, according to a survey they commissioned in 2017. “One of the embarrassing points was that not everyone knew that we are a co-op,” Hatton says. So in 2017, Suma workers decided it was time for a rebrand.\u0026nbspSuma was started over 40 years ago in the kitchen of a house in Leeds. Reg Taylor, owner of a small retail shop, proposed at a meeting attended by other wholefood shops in the north of England that they set up a wholesaling co-operative, to supply to each other, in 1975.The name Suma was first used when the business moved to a lock-up garage in Leeds. In 1977, the business was sold to seven employees who became the founder members of the Triangle Wholefoods Collective Ltd, trading as Suma.Suma has recently benefited as consumers have become more conscious of their health and the ethics of food, plus the growing popularity of veganism. The business introduced its own vegan line in September 2017. New vegan products, including the 2018 introductions of meat-free mini-burgers in tins, have helped sales grow in the last decade.Suma now sells over 7,000 products. The branding has evolved\u0026nbsphaphazardly as lines have been added. Workers knew from customer feedback that they needed a redesign to create a single identity across all ranges, including essential, body and home. Designers also wanted to position Suma at the forefront of the new movement for sustainability and contemporary food.“We really wanted to show off that it was a co-op,” says Harriet Ferguson, senior designer at Pearlfisher, the agency commissioned to do the work. “The existing identity didn’t really do that.” Pearlfisher designers added a tagline to the logo\u0026nbsp“Co-op since 1977” to make Suma distinctive against competition against younger brands. Then they designed a logo out of different shapes to show the different personalities in the co-op.“We called this our Suma of parts and used these shapes to create the logo type. This\u0026nbspdynamic pattern can be used on the packaging at\u0026nbspdifferent levels,” Ferguson says.Suma’s inhouse design team picked some of the trickiest products for Pearlfisher to work on in the redesign, including fiddly products with small labels, like pate tubes, and some that didn’t obviously fit into one range, like coconut products.Pearlfisher turned their designs into a set of packs for Suma’s inhouse designers to roll out across old and new lines. The agency also introduced colour palettes to make different products more identifiable. They used earthy tones for the basic products, simple colours for unprocessed food and bright, natural colours for processed pastas and peanut butter. For the premium products, like speciality coffee, they used a charcoal colour palette with pops of colour.The most important thing, says David Jenkinson, creative designer at Pearlfisher, was creating a sense of the collective in all the elements. “The new identity embodies the idea that this is a collective of iniduals,” he says. “They are aligned, they sing from the same hymn sheet, but they are different.”The new\u0026nbspcolourful logo, with its tessellating shapes, will be seen on lorries up and down the country and on tins and tubes of Suma products in wholefood stockists\u0026nbspfrom January.\u0026nbspWhole Foods releases its 2019 list of new food trendsA key part of Hatton’s job has been communicating the new design to staff internally. In a company where 200 people can vote on every small change, Suma needed a process to make sure the redesign wasn’t delayed by disagreements. “We didn’t want 200 people deciding what colours to use!” says Hatton. Instead the branding team built a case for the rebrand and wrote a business plan. They took the plan to workers, who voted it through. Then the designers were free to make decisions, with in-house work making sure workers were happy with the results.“It’s probably been a little slower, just generally because we’re trying to get consensus and make sure people are behind everything before we proceed,” Hatton says. Some longstanding members wanted to stick with the existing designs, because they saw that it had worked. Hatton and other Suma members listened to them and tried to alleviate any concerns. “In a typical commercial industry people just get told what is happening,” she says. “The difference is that we want people to be passionate about it.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair.

If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.The 41-year-old, whose speech will compete with the Queen‘s just after\u0026nbsp3pm, also opens up about the experience of growing up without a father figure.\u0026nbsp“My dad… he weren’t around when I was a kid. And I love him and that – I don’t blame him. But I was angry, and I got into trouble,” he says.“I had the Old Bill round my gaff every five minutes. I was a wrong ’un. No one knew how to help me. Then I found a father figure I didn’t even know I needed.“I went for an audition for a play and I met this old geezer who wrote it. He was an East Ender, he was a West Ham fan just like me. He thought I was alright and he gave me the part. Turns out it was a fella called Harold Pinter.“He became the most influential man in my life… He taught me that where I came from didn’t dictate where I went to.”He goes on to add: “Life can get a little stressful and we might get on each other’s nerves a bit, but remember how much there is to be proud of, to be grateful of, and get yourself a Harold, you know, if you can … Merry Christmas, my loves.”Danny Dyer’s Alternative Christmas Message airs on Christmas Day at 3.50pm on Channel 4Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The Infinity-O screen has already been used on the Samsung Galaxy A8, meaning the other three could be used in the three expected variants of the Galaxy S10.Previous rumours suggest the three iterations will be called the Galaxy S10 Lite, the Galaxy S10\u0026nbspand the Galaxy S10+.The three versions are expected to vary in size and price, ranging from £699 for the cheapest and smallest 128GB S10\u0026nbspLite\u0026nbspversion, to £1,399 for the biggest and most expensive 1TB S10+ version.S10 (Creative Commons, mobil-helden)Other rumours surrounding the Samsung Galaxy S10\u0026nbspsuggest it may feature a self-healing screen, which makes use of a protective material to help prevent scratches.A Samsung patent for the screen describes an anti-fingerprinting composition having a self-healing property, and a film, a laminate, and a device including the anti-fingerprinting composition, for use in a portable electronic device such as a smart phone or tablet.The Galaxy S10\u0026nbspwill be unveiled at a Samsung event ahead of the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona, according to sources at a major tech retailer cited by the Gizmodo\u0026nbspwebsite.\u0026nbspSamsung has not revealed the exact date of the release, but the smartphone is expected to be released on 8 March 2019.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/27/17/rts1a6jk.jpg","title":"slack ban accounts us sanctions cuba iran","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

The UK will no longer be represented in the European Parliament, and get no say in making EU laws – even if it still has to follow some of them.This will be a big change for the country, but it will be an even bigger one for the UK’s final crop of MEPs – some of whom have been shuttling between the parliament’s twin bases in Brussels and Strasbourg for decades. They will need to decide what to do next.“I’ve made a retirement plan. I’m going to write a blockbuster, Brexit: The Musical,” jokes Molly Scott Cato, a Green MEP who has been at the forefront of campaigning against Brexit.

Those who do aren’t keen to advertise their success: most talk about continued campaigning on issues they care about.\u0026nbspBut there is one running theme in the answers The Independent gets from the British MEPs: among pro-Remain MEPs trying to stop Brexit, few are focused on what to do if they fail – but rather the task in hand.Julie Ward, a Labour MEP for the north west, says she hopes Brexit can be stopped and that she “will hopefully be campaigning for re-election” as an MEP next year. Seb Dance, another pro-Remain Labour MEP, signals he’s in it for the long haul, adding: “If Brexit happens, the very first thing I’ll do will be to involve myself in whatever campaign is working on getting the UK back into the EU.”\u0026nbspTory MEP says EU citizens in UK should not have voting rightsLib Dems to begin process of selecting MEP candidates- despite BrexitTories adopting \u0027far-right ideology\u0027 says former leader of its MEPsTory MEPs thanked by Hungary\u0027s far-right leader Orban for \u0027support\u0027Labour’s European parliament delegation is politically a mixed bunch, but it is far more Europhile than its party in Westminster – which, with some exceptions, has for now more or less submitted to the 2016 referendum result. Few will go on record and say so, but among the exodus of jobless politicians set to return to the UK in March, many fancy a seat in Westminster. The timing of the general election and where gaps open up will be key to how successful they are. For now though, most are trying to push their party leadership in a Remain direction and get its backing for a second referendum.\u0026nbspThough the anti-Brexit struggle is clearly personal for Remain-supporting MEPs – they’re losing their jobs and having their lives uprooted – all the outspoken campaigners against Britain’s departure here are very genuine in their belief that the UK would be better off in the bloc than out.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspOne of the paradoxes of Brexit is that it\u0026nbsphas put the spotlight on Brussels like never before, with all corners of the British press engaging with the EU institutions for the first time. MEPs, who have long been anonymous to British voters, have also had a lot\u0026nbspmore attention. Some of it has been positive: a few have been feted as heroes by pro-Remain campaigners back in the UK. But some has been negative: the Conservative delegation hit headlines in the wrong way earlier this year when it voted against sanctions on the authoritarian Hungarian government of Viktor Orban.\u0026nbspBut from March, the British seats will be unceremoniously ided up among the other countries: 27 will be redistributed immediately, with France, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands the biggest beneficiaries. Forty-six will initially be used to reduce the size of the chamber to 705 MEPs (which will still be rather big by international standards)\u0026nbspand be kept in reserve for future enlargements. MEPs from likely\u0026nbspfuture member states such as\u0026nbspMontenegro and Macedonia will sit where Britain\u0027s once sat.Dorries: \u0027This deal gives us no voice, no votes, no MEPs, no commissioner\u0027“Fighting Brexit these past three years has been like running a marathon. We’re all absolutely exhausted,” Catherine Bearder, the Lib Dems’ sole representative in Brussels, tells The Independent.“I’m one of the older UK MEPs and will finally get to enjoy retirement,” she adds. But despite being on the verge of turning 70, the South East MEP reckons she won’t be able to keep away from the campaigning.“Politicians can never really retire. Not when there are still things in the world worth fighting for,” she says. Ms Bearder plans to continue her campaigning against wildlife trafficking, one of the issues she has pursued with gusto since becoming an MEP a decade ago.But the theme of uncertainty isn’t just found among Europhiles – plenty of Eurosceptics are equally dubious about whether Brexit will happen or not, and aren’t sure where they’re going to be next year either.Ukip’s group of MEPs has taken a beating in recent months – with party leader Gerard Batten admitting he doesn’t know how many have\u0026nbspleft after a series of resignations. Ironically, it is in the European Parliament where the original Eurosceptics have done the best – winning the last European parliament elections the UK participated in in 2014. They’re not expected to pick up any seats in Westminster once Britain has “taken back control”, with most of their voters having long since fled to other parties.Margot Parker, one of the party’s many former deputy leaders, tells The Independent that if she loses her seat she’ll campaign for women’s equality. But with the news as it is, she is as uncertain about her future as her pro-EU colleagues.“As it stands I will be very surprised if we end up leaving next March,” she says. “I\u0027m not booking any holidays yet.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

There are a variety of options, but all have serious problems and would be unlikely to keep everyone happy.Here are the main possibilities – and what’s wrong with them all.The most obvious option is to rerun the 2016 EU referendum question and simply ask people whether they want to remain in the European Union or leave it.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut this question repeats the same mistakes as the last vote: what does “leave” actually mean? The government is currently in deadlock and the referendum is supposed to let the people decide,\u0026nbspbut this question simply doesn’t solve the problem the government is facing. If Leave wins again, we’re back to square one. As a result, it’s unlikely to be asked.\u0026nbspRemain vs Theresa May’s deal vs no dealSplitting out no deal and May’s deal seems to be a logical response to the problems with the last question. Voters would be able to choose between any of the three options.But this would split the Leave vote, leaving Remain to almost certainly win. Most unsustainably, it could even produce a Remain win when the majority of people actually vote for Leave options. Democratically, this is a non-starter\u0026nbspand would reasonably be seen as a stitch-up.‘Do you approve of the Brexit deal negotiated by the government?’The government could simply ask voters to approve or reject the Brexit deal. This suffers from similar problems as the first question: if the deal is rejected, what happens? Do we leave with no deal? Or remain?\u0026nbspIt might prove attractive as a roll of the dice for a government trying to ram through the deal without its MPs – or then again it might not\u0026nbspbecause the public would probably vote it down, according to current polls. This also has no ‘remain’ option so would surely disappoint the main people who want a second referendum – remain voters.One proposal is to ask the questions in two rounds: first, whether voters accept or reject the deal. Then, if it’s rejected, whether they want to remain or leave without a deal.\u0026nbspYou could also ask the questions in a different order if you wanted – leave vs remain first, and then pick between no deal and Therea May’s deal if it’s a Leave vote. But whatever order you ask the questions in, there is a fundamental issue here.Is it really a good idea to put no deal on the ballot paper, and risk giving the government an explicit binding mandate to create food and medicine shortages?\u0026nbspCurrently, parliament can stop a no deal and credibly claim it isn’t what people voted for. But holding this referendum puts economic catastrophe back on the table and could make the situation infinitely worse – which raises the question of why you would want to hold it at all.\u0026nbspPolling suggests that no deal is more popular than May’s deal – it is not impossible that it could win, given voters chose Leave last time.\u0026nbspThis no-deal problem\u0026nbspis a thread that runs through many second referendum options. Explicitly putting it on the ballot paper is probably not a good idea. But not putting it on the ballot paper doesn’t solve the problem.You could ask the three-way question and give\u0026nbspvoters the options of\u0026nbspranking the options, then tally them up using\u0026nbspan alternative vote\u0026nbsp(AV). This is practically the same as two-round voting and has the same problem – no deal is on the ballot.There are also extra problems, such as the fact that AV can produce some quite unintuitive results – and the fact that the system was explicitly rejected for parliamentary elections at a referendum in 2011, so its use would certainly be contested.This is the option favoured by the People’s Vote campaign. In some ways it is the least worst: it rules out no deal. Remainers will like it because it offers them the option of staying. It is also explicit about what each option means, so it solves the deadlock.But it runs the risk of being seen as illegitimate: the fact remains that a not insignificant number of people are actively campaigning for leaving on World Trade Organisation terms without a deal. Many Brexiteers say they see Theresa May’s deal as “no Brexit at all”. They would consider this question a betrayal – forced to choose between two things they don’t want, despite having won the first vote.There is also the question of political deliverability. The country has a Tory government, and if there are two things that the vast majority of Tory MPs don’t want to vote for, they are: Remain, and Theresa May’s deal. So why would they pass a referendum that forces them to choose between two options they hate?Any question with ‘negotiate a different deal’ or ‘Norway’ as an optionThe EU has said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, so putting it as an option in a referendum would be meaningless. If it was voted for the government would be stuck.Similarly, suggestions that a soft Brexit like the Norway option\u0026nbsp(entry into the European Economic Area) or similar could be on the ballot papers misunderstand the situation. The government needs to pass the withdrawal agreement before April or extend or revoke Article 50. Having a referendum on the future relationship is fine, but it wouldn’t solve the problem\u0026nbspand isn’t an alternative to working out what to do with the withdrawal agreement.So in summary…You either risk causing an economic catastrophe by putting no deal on the ballot paper, you exclude no deal as an option and risk the referendum being seen as illegitimate by the people who won last time, or you don’t solve the actual dilemma the government is currently facing.\u0026nbspThat isn’t to take away from the compelling case for a Final Say referendum, which The Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for at length\u0026nbspand collected more than a million signatures in favour of. Done right, another vote\u0026nbspcould solve the UK’s political deadlock, check whether the public still want to leave, and spell out what’s really on offer. But if one is called, the question will have to be chosen carefully, with an awareness of the tradeoffs.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If parliament can’t then it should decide to go back to the people.“Now should be the time of preparation – parliament to make sure it can canvas the options in sensible manner, one by one, to reach agreement on an option or a referendum Europe to ensure that if Britain is ready to think again, Europe is ready also to think again.“All that is necessary is for leadership: in parliament if not in government, and in Europe where despite all the myriad of challenges European leaders have, they should understand that changing Brexit would be the greatest boost to Europe’s economy and politics and that therefore, they need to focus on the part they can play and play it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Students, teachers and parents from 10 schools around China told the Associated Press that Christmas celebrations have been curtailed.“The ongoing local reaction against Christmas is part of the wider sentiment since Xi took power,” said Zi Yang, a China expert at the S\u0026nbspRajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.Jinping claps during a meeting held to celebrate the 40th anniversary of China’s reform (EPA)Mr\u0026nbspJinping is trying to broaden the appeal of the Communist Party by casting it as a crusader for Chinese tradition in a fast-changing world, he said. “Therefore, foreign cultural elements such as Christmas are placed on the chopping block.”The seasonal humbug follows similar outbreaks of anti-Christmas rhetoric in 2014 and 2017. It appears not to be centrally organised, but rather a spreading resistance to foreign festivals by local authorities seeking to align themselves with the growing tide of cultural nationalism.The squeeze on Christmas is an example of how efforts to “normalize” thinking bleed into the everyday lives of many Chinese. That push exploded into view this year through re-education camps for Uighur Muslims and a crackdown on Christian churches that has continued with force in recent weeks.In Nanyang, about 600m\u0026nbspwest of Shanghai, government officials stopped by the office and shopping complex on 16 December to say that Christmas decorations would have to come down, said Ma, the tutoring company employee.An official from the city’s urban management bureau hung up when asked for comment.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An aerial photo shows damaged buildings in Carita after the area was hit by a tsunami on December 22 following an eruption of the Anak Krakatoa volcano.

Communist Party members, the notice said, should avoid foreign festivals and instead be “models of adherence to Chinese traditional culture”.\u0026nbspHengyang police posted a video on their official social media account of locals discussing the importance of Chinese culture and plans to avoid ostentatious Christmas celebrations.Langfang city, just south of Beijing, banned Christmas stage performances and merchandising promotions, according to a notice circulated on social media.Shop windows were to be stripped of Christmas stickers and streets kept free of Christmas banners and lights. Law enforcement patrols were to be stepped up from 23 to 25 December\u0026nbspto prevent illegal signs of celebration.The Langfang urban management bureau declined comment. The state-run Global Times newspaper argued that western media are exaggerating China’s crackdown on Christmas and reported that the restrictions in Langfang were aimed not at Christmas but at cleaning up roadside stalls and migrant vendors in hopes of winning a “National Civilised City” award from the Communist Party.China launches rocket to land rover on far side of Moon for first timeSome 167m\u0026nbspwest, Fuping county, also in Hebei province, issued a similar clean-up notice. Though the 21 December\u0026nbspannouncement mentions Christmas 11\u0026nbsptimes, an official from the Fuping urban management bureau said the rules were aimed at street vendors generally, not Christmas.Police in the Panlong district of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province in southern China, circulated a notice that hotels, karaoke parlours, internet cafes, bars and other crowded places must prohibit Christmas-related decorations and activities.“It is forbidden to hang Christmas stockings, wear Christmas hats, place Christmas trees, and so on,” the notice read.It wasn’t clear if the notice applied to all of Kunming city, though a police officer told the AP that the order to circulate it came from city officials.Reverend Jonathan Liu, founder of the Chinese Christian Fellowship of Righteousness, said the pushback against Christmas reflects\u0026nbspMr Jinping’s efforts to “sinicize” religion.Preachers are coached on how to convey Communist Party core values in their sermons and national flags and songs have been injected into some church services, he said.Mr Liu provided the AP with a notice sent to churches in Zhoukou, a city to the east of Nanyang in Henan province.It tells churches to vet Christmas plans with the government, forbids minors from participating in Christmas events and caps expenses at 2000 yuan (£230). “I wish you all a happy Christmas! God bless you,” read the notice, which Mr Liu received from a pastor in China.An official at the United Front Work Department in Zhoukou referred queries to the religious affairs bureau, which could not be reached for comment.Before becoming president, Xi went to Finland in 2010 and was photographed with Santa Claus. That kind of chumminess appears to be a thing of Christmas past, experts say.The central government issued guidelines last year for a cultural revival project that calls for a marked boost in the international influence of Chinese traditional culture by 2025.“You have a culturally conservative ethos in the country that has definitely been encouraged by the central party-state,” said Guo Yingjie, a professor of Chinese studies at the University of Sydney. “It’s not hard for university presidents or officials to say, ‘OK celebrating Christmas can easily be seen as de-sinification or promoting western culture.”’Students have taken to social media to complain about restrictions on Christmas celebrations at their schools.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An aerial photo shows damaged buildings in Carita after the area was hit by a tsunami on December 22 following an eruption of the Anak Krakatoa volcano.

However the US to Mexico also had the highest rate of return migration,\u0026nbspaccounting for 1.3 million people – four times the rate of return from the United Arab Emirates to India.Approximately 45 per cent of migrants returned to their home country in the studied period from 1990 to 2015. This appears to be particularly relevant for those displaced by conflict.“We estimate a rate of return migration that is significantly higher than other methods, but it is also supported by history,” Professor Raftery said.Drop the Target: Javid says ‘tens of thousands’ immigration goal gone“For example, during the Rwandan genocide in 1994, more than a million migrants left the country, but most returned within three years after the conflict ended.”Mass migration is still mainly being driven by major world conflicts and events, the study suggests. The civil war in Syria accounted for two of the top three emigration drivers between 2010 and 2015 in the study with flows from Syria to Turkey and from Syria to Lebanon accounting for 1.5 million people and 1.2 million people respectively.“For the migration field, this level of accuracy is a significant improvement,” said Jonathan Azose, the study’s lead author.“Even when you look at data from European countries, it’s not uncommon for a single migration flow to have estimates that differ by a factor of three or more depending on whether the sending or the receiving country collected the data.”Asylum and ImmigrationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

above all  is a sign that the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party are prepared to back her Brexit deal.“Without the DUP, they haven’t got a chance of passing it,” warns one Cabinet minister.What, then, do the DUP need to come on board One Secretary of State who has kept open lines of communication with them, tells me that “by grim necessity, they will need something more than cosmetic concessions to vote for the deal”.This minister explains that “the DUP want a bankable reassurance that the backstop won’t be permanent and that there won’t be progressive ergence between Great Britain and Northern Ireland”.The good news for Theresa May is that, according to one of those intimately involved in the negotiations, “the DUP want to sort things out”.“Relations between the leadership and the DUP had been in the deep freeze, they are somewhat better,” one Cabinet minister tells me.Adding that “the carelessness with which some of the principals have been treated has been repaired”.But the bad news for Theresa May is that the changes they want are signicant — and the EU aren’t going to offer them up straight away.The only way to get these changes might be to have Parliament vote for them and tell the EU that this is how the deal can get through and seethey are prepared to cooperate, or whether they’ll crash the entire Brexit negotiation over these additions.But one senior Cabinet minister laments that “Number  is miles away from being in that position”.This Secretary of State is adamant that they are “going to have to move”.Intriguingly, I am told the Irish have, via diplomatic back channels, communicated that one of the reasons they wouldn’t give May what she wanted at last week’s European Council was that they weren’t certain that what she was asking for would satisfy the DUP.I understand that privately senior Irish figures have been making clear thatthey knew precisely what the DUP wanted, they could then engage with that.I am told the Government will devote the dog days between Christmas and New Year to exploring what the DUP will accept, and what the EU can give.Getting the DUP back on board is vital for May because without that there is no chance of reducing the Tory rebellion down to a manageable size.The Tory machine is having a bit of success in whittling down the numbers against May’s deal.One hardcore Brexiteer admits that some backbench rebels “will go a bit soft”.But this sht is not yet anywhere near big enough to save May’s deal.Some in Cabinet are pinning their hopes on “people coming back after Christmas more pragmatic and less militant”.But one of those who has been trying to reduce the rebellion wearily remarks, “I don’t see much evidence of that.”The person who in Parliament, perhaps, knows the Tory Party best tells me that the equation is this: “If they get a legally binding codicil on the backstop, they’ll get it through.If they don’t, they won’t.”Over to you, Mrs May.A TORY MP is already telling colleagues that he has submitted his letter calling for a no-confidence vote in Theresa May next December.It is another reminder that the leadership issue isn’t going to go away.One loyalist Cabinet minister argues thatMay makes it through Brexit, she should then announce the timetable for her departure at conference next year.Having said when she’s off would probably be enough to prevent a confidence vote next December and allow her to leave with some dignity.May, though, is unlikely to bite on this idea.She is extremely resistant to boxing herself in on a departure date.The confidence vote has won May some time.But she won’t make next Decembershe interprets the result as a licence to carry on as before.One senior party figure is already complaining that she’s “not prepared to make the personnel changes that would help her own position”.While one figure inside the Government machine fumes that “the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing in Number  and that is causing havoc for the rest of us”.Meanwhile, ambitious Cabinet ministers are continuing to lay the ground for their leadership bids.But as one Secretary of State points out, “It is normally the manner and nature of the departure that determines the successor” which is one of the reasons why the coming Tory leadership race will be the most unpredictable contest in living memory.THE Tory rage at Jeremy Corbyn over his alleged “stupid woman” comment at Prime Minister’s Questions was fuelled by a sense that the Speaker John Bercow is biased against them.As Anna Soubry, who is normally infuriating her fellow Tories by calling for a second referendum, pointed out: If it had been a Tory man who had apparently said it about a Labour woman, Bercow would have been all over it.In recent months, senior Labour figures have openly admitted that they are prepared to turn a blind eye to the allegations of bullying against Bercow because they think he’ll help them on Brexit.This is an untenable position – it is like a team keeping a referee on the pitch because they think he’ll give them a penalty in injury time.As Wednesday showed, we are dangerously close to the Tory side of the chamber simply not accepting Bercow’s authority.One senior Tory backbencher, who has defended the Speaker in the past, tells me “it felt like an insurrection”.The tragedy of Bercow’s speakership is that once gone, the chair’s reputation for impartiality will be almost impossible to restore.MPs will never again trust in the neutrality of the Speaker as they once did.THERESA MAY is planning a New Year charm offensive as she tries to persuade Tory MPs to back her Brexit deal.All of them – and their spouses – have been invited to a party in Downing Street in the week of January , which is when the Commons debate on her deal resumes.The implicit message is clear: If the Government falls over Brexit and the Tories tear themselves apart over the issue, then there won’t be any more invites to Number  for you and your partner for a very long time.Whether this is enough to win round any wavering Tory MPs remains to be seen.It is going to take more than a few drinks to make the hardcore Brexiteers swallow their objections to the backstop.EvenTheresa May can win the big vote on her Brexit deal, she won’t be home and dry.Once the vote is won, the withdrawal agreement will have to be turned into law.This will provide plenty of opportunities for guerrilla warfare in Parliament.Cabinet ministers are particularly worried that rebels might put down an amendment making the payment of the £billion orce bill conditional on progress in the trade talks.If that passed, the EU would say that the UK hasn’t ratied the agreement and so there was no deal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have minds of our own, and we need to take responsibility for our own actions.The reappearance of naked prejudice on the terraces can’t be blamed on anyone other than the racists themselves — and the other fans who stay silent instead of calling out the racists.These people should be named and shamed. Social media could be put to good use by posting a rogues’ gallery on every  and the faces of the bigots should be prominent, so that their wives, mothers and children can see what they’ve done. Roll on #stampoutracism.But the mystery is why there is an upsurge in such incidents right now.I, for one, thought that with the determined efforts of the clubs, led by the Kick It Out campaign, such scenes would cease. But I should have known better. Back in the early Seventies I lived ten minutes from Stamford Bridge — but I never went to home games.When it became fashionable to throw darts at our own fans, a black face standing in the Shed was nothing less than a walking bullseye.By the mid-Nineties I hoped it would be OK to bring my seven-year-old daughter and her pals to a game.Surely, there could be no danger in seats below the directors’ boxes, away from the common herd It took  minutes for me to learn the truth as two men in front of us leapt up to abuse the Sheffield Wednesday midfielder Carlton Palmer, screaming “You lanky-legged black ****”.I tapped one on the shoulder. He looked around, saw my face, and immediately apologised profusely. But the damage was done.Three weeks later, I attended a dinner at the City of London’s most glittering venue, the Guildhall.Suddenly, I found myself confronted by a familiar face — one of the same two men who had sat in the stand in front of us.A true racist, yet here he was, suave, suited and booted, at the heart of the British establishment. So much for the idea that all racists are ignorant, lower-class idiots.So what’s happened It seems bizarre that the Premier League, dominated by foreign players, many of them black, should still suffer from prejudice.And with top teams regularly playing in Europe, plus a successful England team nearly half of whose members are black or mixed race it’s hard to see why fans should start throwing bananas on the pitch again.But the truth is that many of the factors that drove racism on the terraces have never gone away, and have never been challenged effectively. Yes, recent political arguments about the EU and about immigration have allowed some of the scumbags who the game thought it had chased away to resurface with renewed bravado.It’s also possible that the increase in the number of fans from Eastern Europe, where attitudes to ersity are decidedly less tolerant, may have had an effect.Perhaps some of the brilliant players from Europe who now grace the English game might put themselves in the front line of their re-education.Butthe game wants to stamp out racism for good it needs to take a long, hard look at itself.In the Premier League, around one in five players are black.The number of black owners and coaches is negligible. This is sending out the worst message imaginable.I welcome the advent of great players like N’Golo Kante, Romelu Lukaku, and Dele Alli. But this is a sport owned and run almost exclusively by white men, who buy and sell black men at will.Yes, of  course, the heaviest weight that the players have to lt is their own multimillion-pound pay packets, so I don’t seek sympathy for them.But basically, football looks like the th-century plantation economy of the American South.It’s time for the game to start taking steps to make sure that its owners, their boards of directors and their executive and coaching staff look more like modern Britain.Arsenal v BurnleyAFC Bournemouth v BrightonCha v Leicester CityHuddersfield Town v SouthamptonManchester City v Crystal PalaceNewcastle United v FulhamWest Ham United v WatfordCardf City v Manchester UnitedIf the people at the top of the game seem to think that it’s OK to treat black people like field slaves, why would they expect the fans to treat the players with respect I saw my first game — Arsenal vs Leicester City — at the old Highbury ground.My dad wanted me to see his hero, the great inside-left George Eastham, in action.He realised that I was too small to see over the parapet, so we took the biggest book we had in the house for me to stand on. I watched Eastham while standing on Uncle Tom’s Cabin, the bestselling anti-slavery novel that had touched off the American Civil War.Maybe every owner needs to be sent a copy of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s book to remind our contemporary plantation bosses that it’s time for them too to confront the bigotry written into the game’s soul.Football’s racism hasn’t gone away, and it never will until we all look at its evil full in the face.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This lets them, and our country, down.The SNP also attacked Mr Corbyn, with Westminster leader Ian Blackford calling him the midwe to the delivery of the Torys Brexit plans.Blackford said: Jeremy Corbyn has finally come off the fence hes been sat on for the past two years.But unfathomably hes come down on the same side as Theresa May.The Labour party is incapable of providing opposition to the worst UK government that most people can remember.Lib Dem leader Vince Cable added that Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off.He added: He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.On Brexit, you simply cannot put a cigarette paper between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn.The Labour chief was rated below Iain Duncan Smith, William Hague and Neil Kinnock after  months in the job."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0004574726272.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may government needs mojo back","story":"But it appears in short supply at the moment, and we don’t just mean the Cabinet scrapping like cats in a bag over Brexit.It is unforgivable, for instance, that Chris Grayling dropped changes to drone regulation, only for the country to be utterly humiliated by the Gatwick chaos.Similarly, a much-needed beefing up of our domestic violence laws — off the back of our Save our Shelters campaign — has been shunted into next year, leaving vulnerable women without the protection they deserve.What are they doing  We know preparing for Brexit is a big job but it seems asthe party has lost all of its other abilities and policies as a result.Where are the radical ideas to actually deliver a housing revolution, rather than just talking about one What reasons are the Government giving for businesses to invest in the UK, or agree a new deal The Chancellor spends more time working out which choc bar he wants to make more expensive than he does delivering tax cuts for hard-working Brits.Jeremy Corbyn’s band of Marxists are far from merry.

This might not be good news to those who, like me, believe she has made a dog’s Brexit of EU negotiations, but it would be unchristian on Christmas Eve to ignore Mrs May’s transformation.She seems almost to have shrugged off the crushing burden of responsibility and begun to enjoy herself. Voters have noticed. At ious pre-Christmas gatherings, I have been struck by expressions of warmth for Mrs May personally, even among hardened Brexiteers.So, in the spirit of Christmas, let’s put dferences aside and raise a glass to the PM’s health and happiness.She has benefited from the ghastliness of her enemies — the thuggish European Commision, drunken groper Jean Claude Juncker, biased Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow and snide Jeremy Corbyn. Their mean-spirited sneers have stirred a passion for the underdog among fair-minded Brits — surprisingly, more among men than women.It is refreshing to see bellowing toad Bercow, a toxic stain on the centuries-old tradition of Speaker impartiality, finally at bay over allegations of abuse of his high office. Bercow’s blatant contempt for Parliament coincides with Corbyn’s disintegration and Labour’s irrelevance.Only last week Corbyn was held up as the scary monster who would eat us alivegiven the chance. Today he stands shredded for all to see, as a pathetic non-entity who somehow became Leader of HM Opposition.Corbyn feebly denies live TV evidence of him branding Theresa May a “stupid woman”.  He is entitled to his opinion but it is demeaning to lie about it. No wonder two of his closest MPs, Fiona Onasanya and Kate Osamor, have also been caught lying through their teeth. And they are just the ones brought to the attention of police.Suddenly, far from Corbyn sweeping to power as Britain’s first Marxist PM, polls suggest he would be thrashed in a snap Election, with the Tories regaining their outright majority.  But perhaps not under this leader.Which brings me to another reason to be cheerful. Boris Johnson has been cleared of trumped-up charges of Islamophobia levelled by Tory chairman Brandon Lewis, spurred on by Mrs May herself.In an article supporting the right of Muslim women to wear what they like, Boris warned hijabs made them look like bank robbers or “letter boxes”.As with much of the ridicule hurled at Boris since Brexit, this was calculated to undermine his chances of winning any future leadership battle. But the really good news this festive season is the panic beginning to grip those who want to reverse the  referendum and keep Britain in Europe at any cost.Project Fear has become Project Farce. Fanatical Remoaners, not Brexiteeers, can be seen as the real swivel-eyed loonies.Time is running out — and it isn’t on their side. Either they accept Mrs May’s dodgy deal by March  or we’re OUT. As Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom explains, MPs cannot block Brexit.Far from being frightened off, foreign firms are pouring cash into UKplc. Savvy tech giants Apple, Google and Amazon have bet billions on post-Brexit Britain.  More firms are setting up HQs in London than any other EU capital and Britain has been voted the best country in the world to do business.We have just marked the wintry Shortest Day, a symbolic turning point, with the best jobs record in jobless Europe while the Eurozone faces an economic disaster. We are a long way short of high summer.But every day from now until the end of daylight- saving in March, things should get brighter and brighter. Have a wonderful Christmas and a terric New Year.AND finally, the best news of all. Ex-Chancellor George Osborne was filleted live on Saturday’s Today programme by BBC veteran David Dimbleby.Perhaps expecting an easy ride from a fellow Remainer, Georgie Boy was accused of cutting and running after the  referendum – and using his Treasury job to feather his nest.Comparing Osborne to greedy ex-PM Tony Blair, Dimbleby asked: “Why are you following in his foot-steps by taking job after job and earning millions of pounds a year  You became prominent because you were Chancellor.It’s as though going into politics – which you aban-doned when it turned against you – was a pathway to what you do now, making a buck.”The sound of spluttering could be heard.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

From blimps to budgets, reshuffles to revolts. There have been more crunch weeks for Theresa May than we care to count, while Jeremy Corbyn went from hosting his own music festival to battling Labours anti-Semitism scandal. And through it all Brexit loomed like an ever present spectre. But away from that elusive deal, there has been a whole host of unusual political occurrences to distract us. In fact you might be surprised that all of this really did happen just in the last  months. How much do you remember  . Chris Grayling becomes Tory Party chairman - for all of  seconds  Theresa Mays Cabinet reshuffle descended into chaos when a reported move for Tory Transport Secretary Chris Grayling was announced, then deleted. The Partys official Twitter account reported that Grayling was to be made Conservative Party Chairman. But seconds later the tweet was deleted. Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis later arrived at Downing Street, reportedly to be told he was to be made chairman instead. That left Mr Grayling as Transport Secretary - a post were probably all relieved he stayed in. . Boris Johnson suggests building a bridge to FranceWhat is this mans obsession with bridges ! Boris Johnson gave his backing to not one but two Brexit bridges in . In February he spoke out in favour of a bridge across the channel linking the UK with France as an alternative to the tunnel. The idea was ruled out in the s but Mr Johnson insists the technology has moved on. Then in June the former Foreign Secretary said an idea for a pound billion bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland should be seriously considered. Plans for a garden bridge- one of Johnsons many plans consigned to the rubbish heap, cost the taxpayer poundm.

Gavin Williamson tells Russia to go away and shut up following the Skripal poisoning  The Tory minister was asked at an event in Bristol whether he would consider a military response” to Russia after ex-spySergei Skripaland his daughter were exposed to a nerve agent. He did not rule it out but also said Britain should not be “rushing to do too much too rapidly”. He said: We’ll look at how Russia responds to what we have done It is atrocious and outrageous what Russia did in Salisbury. We have responded to that. Frankly Russia should go away, it should shut up. . Newsnight denies photoshopping Jeremy Corbyns hat to make it look more Russian  The BBC dismissed complaints that Newsnight altered a photo of Jeremy Corbyn to make him look more Russian. Thursdays show used a graphic of the Labour leader next to images of Moscow as the backdrop to an item about his response to the Salisbury poisoning. Critics said his hat was digitally altered and it was all designed to make him look like a Soviet stooge. Left wing commentator Owen Jones told the programme: “The media framing has been a disgrace and I have to say that includes your own program,” Jones said during his appearance. Yesterday the background of your program you had Jeremy Corbyn dressed up against the Kremlin skyline, dressed up as a Soviet stooge. “You even photoshopped his hat to look more Russian. People should complain to the BBC about that kind of thing.” But the topical news programme insisted they had used the same backdrop alongside a picture of Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and the only thing they changed about the hat was the colour saturation. In April the Mirror reported claims made by Dominic Raabs then diary secretary about how she was working as an escort on the side. But the element of the story that seemed to capture the imagination of Westminster was her claim that Mr Raab ate the same lunch everyday - something he later denied. The woman claimed: “He has the same sandwich every day. He has the same lunch. “He has the same baguette with the same smoothie with a pot of fruit everyday. “It’s from Pret. He has the chicken Caesar and bacon baguette, superfruit pot and the vitamin volcano smoothie every day. “He is so weird. I get it for him. I go to Pret. That’s how I know. It’s the Dom Raab Special.” It wasnt long before the Dom Raab special became a thing. . Labour loses hundreds of thousands of pounds trying to organise a music festivalLast year Jeremy Corbyn clearly enjoyed the Glastonbury audience chanting his name. So what could be so hard about Labour organising its own festival. Those who attended the Labour Live certainly had fun but it proved a financial and PR disaster for the party. The festival, which was originally expecting to welcome , people to North London, had reportedly sold just , tickets with around a month to go. Ticket prices were slashed from pound to pound and the unions stepped in buying batches which they distributed to their members. Its understood the party lost around poundm on the event. But Party chairman Ian Lavery that they would be hosting the festival in  - and it would be twice as big. . Giant Donald Trump baby blimp greeted the President  It is almost certainly not the welcome the US President was hoping for - or expecting but Donald Trumps visit inspired tens of thousands of people to take to the streets in protest. And floating high above Parliament Square was the six-metre tall balloon which portrayed Trump as an angry infant, complete with a nappy and a whisp of blonde hair.   Donald Trump didnt exactly appear a natural when he met his herothe Queenfor the first time this afternoon. The US President met the monarch at Windsor Castle as part of his four-day working visit of the UK - and part of the historic meeting involved inspecting the troops together. It was a baking hot day and the -year-old was forced to stand in the sun waiting for Mr Trump to arrive. Then as he joined her to inspect the Coldstream Guards, he walked in front with the monarch dwarfed by his large frame. The Queen did not miss a beat and quickly moved to Mr Trumps other side while, for his part, he seemed none the wiser.  Theresa May dancing in Africa - not once but twiceTheresa May showed off her dance moves a second time on her trip to Africa. Despite some less than complimentary critiques of her boogeying on down with schoolkids in Cape Town, the Prime Minister took the opportunity to bust a move when she met some scouts in Nairobi. But Mrs May, who awkwardly swayed in South Africa, looked much more relaxed in Kenya. She waved her arms and rocked her hips, learning dance moves from the young scouts - and she even seemed to be smiling as she moved.   The Tory Attorney General, and more importantly, the warm up act forTheresa Mays keynote speech to Conservative Party Conference certainly made those in the hall sit up and listen. And to be honest, he didnt need a microphone. Most residents of the Midlands could have popped their heads out of an upstairs window and heard his booming, silken tones wafting on the wind. He was little known beforehand but Mr Coxs performance at Tory Conference, and later when he explained his Brexit legal advice to the Commons, will not be easily forgotten.  Theresa May dances again and it was just as awkward as youd expect   Theresa May danced onto the stage to Abbas Dancing Queen in nod to her embarrassing dancing on a trip to Africa. The Prime Minister made a joke at her own expense as she beganher speech to the Tory Party Conference. Mrs May twisted her hips and swung her arms as she entered the Symphony Hall in Birmingham. It was a deliberate nod to the embarrassing moves she flaunted on an official trip to Africa.  Dominic Raab admitted he hadnt understood importance of trade with France  At the time Dominic Raab was Brexit Secretary when he revealed he hadnt understood the importance of trade with France. Seventeen per cent of the UK’s trade in goods, or pound billion annually, goes through Dover to either Calais or Dunkirk, according to port officials. He also spoke about the peculiar, frankly, geographic, economic entity that is the United Kingdom with many on social media mocking him for Speaking at a London tech event, Mr Raab said: “I hadn’t quite understood the full extent of this, butyou look at the UK and you look at how we trade in goods, we are particularly reliant on the Dover-Calais crossing. He was widely mocked for the comments.  Karen Bradley admits she didnt know the basics of Northern Irish politics  In another example of a government minister all over their brief Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley admitted before taking on the job she was slightly scared of the region and didnt understand its politics. She said she didnt realise hat nationalists did not vote for unionists and that unionists did not vote for nationalists - which could be considered the very basic details about Northern Ireland. “I freely admit that when I started this job, I didn’t understand some of the deep-seated and deep-rooted issues that there are in Northern Ireland,” Ms Bradley told House magazine. “I didn’t understand things like when elections are fought, for example, in Northern Ireland – people who are nationalists don’t vote for unionist parties and vice versa.

The European Research Group struggle to count to   Tory Brexiteers had to admit their bid to topple Theresa May embarrassingly flopped because of infighting in their ranks. Tory MP Steve Baker said there was “a tactical disagreement” among supporters of the hardline European Research Groupof Tory Brexiteers, over when to force a no-confidence vote in Mrs May’s leadership.

The Brighton MP put up no resistance as handed over the mace before being ordered to leave the chamber for the day by Speaker John Bercow. Mr Russell-Moyles actions came after Theresa May delayed the Brexit deal vote, something he vocally opposed in earlier exchanges.

People arriving at the airport on Sunday evening were delayed taking off for their flights to Bristol. But after arriving later than planned they they faced a wait of more than three hours to get their bags from the planes. The baggage reclaim area was reportedly full of ‘tired and grumpy’ passengers, with children sleeping on the baggage carousel. Passengers claimed they were ‘locked in’ the reclaim hall for hours, Bristol Live reports. Airport bosses said there were a number of ‘off-schedule flights’ arriving at the time, which caused a backlog in baggage handling. A spokesman promised a review into what went wrong. But frustrated passengers lambasted the airport and the baggage handling set-up on Twitter, with one even claiming it was quicker to sort out the Brexit deal than get the baggage off the planes. Twitter user Steve first began to complain after waiting for an hour and a half for his bags to emerge from a flight into Bristol from Berlin. “Whats going on  ” he asked Bristol Airport. “Meeting Berlin flight waiting for mins for luggage!! Unacceptable.”  Then, while the wait continued and more passengers arrived, he said: “An hour and three quarters now. This is the bread and butter of your job and you clearly arent capable of doing it. Its not like a load of unexpected planes can turn up! “Two hours now - you realize Santa will be unloading gt billion presents tomorrow night. Might be worth askinghe does training,” he joked. Finally, the bags from the Berlin flight began to arrive on the carousel. “Two hours  mins in the end - Mrs May makes faster progress on Brexit than that!” he said. Darren Sainty said his flight in from Paris had been delayed by four hours in France, and then the bags took three hours to be unloaded off the plane. He described ‘children sleepingbaggage belts’. And Rachel Baker complained her simple one-hour flight from Glasgow to Bristol turned into a nightmare. “Thanks for such a fun night,” she said. “Look at all these happy faces, at Glasgow airport at pm for a one-hour flight, past am and still waiting for our luggage in Bristol. Locked in a room with no information and nowhere to sit, she added. The delays were also felt by friends and family waiting on the other side of the passport control in the arrivals hall. Pat Seymour was one, who waited for hours for her son to emerge from the Berlin flight. He arrived on an easyJet flight from Berlin, he landed at midnight and came through baggage reclaim at .am, she said. I was the other side waiting for one of the tired, grumpy people. I can certainly testy to weary passengers and exhausted children coming through from baggage reclaim when they eventually got their luggage.  The only people available to speak to were security staff and the young lady on the information desk. One lady who was waiting asked herit would be possible to speak to the Swissport duty manager and was informed that they were probably in the baggage hall. I don’t knowshe did manage to get anyone to come and speak to her, but my son said there was no one there to speak to about the situation when I asked him, she added. Pierluigi Stanzione was waiting for his -year-old mum to arrive for Christmas from Naples. She was due to arrive at Bristol Airport at .pm on Sunday evening, but didnt actually take off from the southern Italiian city until .pm. She didnt get off the plane until midnight, but her baggage didnt arrive in the baggage hall until .am. No one said a word until my mum complained and only at that point passengers were told that the flight was delayed so there was no staff from Swissport to unload the luggage, he said. A spokesperson for Bristol Airport apologised to passengers. “Sorry for the delay that you experienced,” passengers were told. “This was caused by a number of off schedule flights arriving at the time. Airport staff were in location to assist with information and queries. On behalf of your airline we apologise for the delay,” she added. A spokesperson told Bristol Live: Delays were experienced to the arrival of passengers baggage overnight Sunday, December  and Monday, December  to a small number of flights. This was caused due to flight disruption across the flight schedule earlier in the day. As a result of the knock-on effect with the delayed flights arriving off scheduled, airline ground handling resources were stretched at times, meaning some passengers experienced baggage delays. We continue to work with our airline handling partners to limit the inconvenience caused to passengers. Airline handling and customer service staff were present in the baggage reclaim area assisting during the delay. Bristol Airport apologises and appreciates the frustration passengers experienced due to the delay in the arrival of their bags. An internal investigation with the airline handling agent will be completed, she added. The baggage handling at Bristol Airport is done by a company called Swissport. “We are aware that there were a signicant number of flights arriving off schedule at Bristol airport on the evening of the rd and early on the th, causing a knock-on impact to baggage reclaim for passengers, said a Swissport spokesperson. “We work closely with our airline and airport partners to mitigate the impact of these schedule disruptions to passengers and we understand these delays were frustrating to passengers during this busy holiday period, he added.

The Met Office issued a danger to le weather warning from pm Christmas Eve to am Christmas Day as large swathes of the country face freezing fog misery. It said fog or freezing fog patches which could be dense in places are expected from the South West to the East Midlands, and Yorkshire and the Humber. Visibility could be cut to  metres in the worst-hit areas and the Met Office said it could lead to slower journey times. Eight regions have been issued with yellow weather warnings, as forecasters predict a huge band of eerie freezing fog will become widespread.  East Midlands, East of England, London and the South East, North East England, South West England, West Midlands and Yorkshire and Humber are said to be affected by the mist. The visibility may fall to around  metres at times, the Met Office said. Fog will tend to thin and lt in western and some central areas of England overnight, but will be slow to clear on Christmas Day in the east, perhaps persisting for much or all of the day in parts of Eastern England.  It will be frosty in northern Scotland and parts of Wales. But no snow is yet forecast for any regions. Dozens of flood alerts are also in place across the country. Despite roads being busy, the RAC said on Monday conditions on Christmas Eve had been pretty smooth with no major problems reported. Main motorways did see some delays but traffic was generally good, despite an additional two-and-a-half million vehicles on the road. A RAC spokesman said: Some areas have been busy around town centres today due to last-minute shopping, but its mostly local congestion.  Mild temperatures are expected across the country, meaning the odds of a white Christmas are now extremely slim. Forecaster Greg Dewhurst said:could be quite dense from this evening and through the night tonight. It will be a grey start for most. In the east it will be mostly dry, an odd spot of drizzle is possible in the west. Highways England lted more than  miles of roadworks on the countrys motorways and major A-roads on Friday to ensure more than % of its network is open. But drivers were being hit with Christmas getaway fuel costs at a five-year high, with UK forecourts charging motorists an average of pound. per litre for petrol and pound. per litre for diesel, according to Government data. The last time prices were this high in the run-up to Christmas was .   Ella Colley, a Halfords spokeswoman, said: “Statistically, fog is the most dangerous driving hazard. Drivers should keep their fog lights on but do not switch on the high beam as this directs light into the fog, making it more dficult to see. “It is easy to speed in fog because landmarks that allow judgement of speed are dficult to see. Keep an eye on the speedometer to ensure a sensible speed. If motorists can’t see  metres ahead they need to be driving at less than mph.” People hoping to escape motoring misery were warned to plan ahead due to planned engineering works on train lines. As usual, there are no trains on Christmas Day and only a limited service will run on Boxing Day.   But some of Network Rails  Christmas engineering projects have already begun, forcing a number of lines to be closed. These include no services between London Victoria - the UKs second busiest station - and Clapham Junction until January  due to track renewal. Crossrail work means there are no trains operating to or from London Paddington on December , with a reduced service on December , ,  and  which could cause problems for airline passengers using Heathrow Airport. Liverpool Lime Street will have an amended service from Monday until New Years Day, affecting Virgin Trains, East Midlands Trains, London Northwestern Railway and Northern. There are improvement projects at numerous other locations and passengers are urged to check the National Rail Enquiries website before they travel.

Heston advises leaving potatoes in to boil for  minutes before roasting - which is longer than most of us do as it almost cooks them through. He also suggests putting the peelings in the cooking water to improve the flavour. Good idea.  Number two, you need to scuff up those potatoes as you drain them to make sure they go extra crispy. You could do this by giving them a bit of a shake in the colander, but dont do it too hard. Basically, you want them to crumble just a little, so that the oil or fat covers a wider surface area and penetrates deeper into the potato. If you really want that crispiness, this genius tip is guaranteed to get results - and it may seem a little unusual. What you need to do is score the potatoes with a fork. This creates ridges and grooves, perfect for golden, crispy goodness. Thirdly, Heston also says that metal baking trays are best. Avoid glass or Pyrex. Metal is a better conductor, so the oil will get hotter faster, which means a crispier exterior. Have you got a hot tip for perfect roast potatoes  Let us know in the comments!

The distressed Staffordshire bull terrier, nicknamed Snoop by RSPCA staff, tried to get back inside the vehicle - jumping up at the window - as he was dumped in Stoke-on-Trent just days before Christmas. Footage released by the RSPCA shows a man getting out of the car, tossing a dog bed on the pavement and leading the white and black Staff before unclipping its lead and running back to the vehicle. Now, hundreds of people, including celebs, have offered to give Snoop a home after more than a million watched the clip posted online, StokeonTrentLive reports.  BBC political presenter Andrew Neil wrote on Twitter: So disturbed by this footage. I say to RSPCAyou have trouble re-homing this little dog, I will take it gladly.I have been in tears. It was how the little dog tried to get back in the car that killed me. Former Big Brother winner and DJ Kate Lawler said: Fine, you can no longer care for your pet but for the love of God, please dont abandon animals in the street. There are shelters all over the UK who can help find your pet a new home. This is the most upsetting video to watch.  The dog was dumped at the corner of Timor Groce and Pacic Road in Trentham at about pm on December . It shows a vehicle pull up and a man get of the passenger seat car carrying a dog bed and leading a white and black pooch. He then crosses the road, leaving the bed on the pavement and unclipping the lead, before running back to the car and driving away, while the distressed dog repeatedly jumps up at the window. A passer-by found Snoop sitting in the bed around an hour later before the RSPCA was alerted.  RSPCA inspector Natalie Perehovsky said: “The footage has to be seen to be believed, it’s just awful.To see the poor dog in such obvious distress jumping up at the car as it drives away it just heartbreaking. I can’t understand how someone could do this. “The vets scanned his microchip and we have traced two previous owners in the Birmingham area, but do not believe either are the current owners, and therefore not those responsible for abandoning the dog. “One man can be seen clearly in the footage dumping the dog, and there is a second person in the driver seat of the car. I am very keen to hear from anyone who recognises the vehicle, the man or the dog.  “The veterinary staff have nicknamed the dog Snoop, and he is in good condition, thought to be two years old. He is a white Staffie with black marking, and is such a friendly, lovely boy. He’s currently being cared for at a private boarding kennels where he will get all the care he needs whilst I investigate further. “Anyone who recognises the vehicle, the dog or the men in the footage can contact me in complete confidence. “It’s beggars belief that someone could abandon a dog like this at Christmas, but we are so thankful to the kind people who found Snoop sitting sadly in his bed, for taking him to the safety of a vets straight away.” The RSPCA expects to take more than , animals into its care this winter.

Padraig Howard, , loves the festive treats so much he took on the mammoth challenge for charity. He replaced every meal with mince pies in a  day festive challenge from December  until Christmas Day. The behavioural support worker has scoffed  mince pies - , calories - yet lost a staggering kgand now weighs kg. He ate around  a day and ate them whenever he got peckish rather than at assigned meal times.   Pod, from Belsize Park, London said: You dont realise the importance of how your eating habits influence your health until you do something stupid. I dont think I will be having anymore mince pies. Inspired by the documentary Super Size Me, which sees a man eat McDonalds three times a day, Pod ditched all other food for the  day period. Pod said: Ive always loved mince pies and last year I ate a lot of them over last Christmas. So much so my friends even pointed out how many Id been eating and we started joking about the idea of doing some sort of food challenge for charity. Like the guy from Super Size Me, who eat nothing but McDonalds, except Id eat nothing but mince pies over December. He purchased the festive treats from supermarkets including Tesco, Sainsburys and Morrisons, as well as Pret a Manger - who gave him some freebies - and independent bakeries.   Pod said: To begin with I tried consuming my normal calories in mince pie form but I really struggled with my sugar levels, so now I just snack as and when Im hungry. I went and got a big stockpile of mince pies from all your typical high street shops, Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsburys, Ive also been eating them from bakerys and cafes. Morrisons apple turnover mince pies were probably the best of high street names but the best mince pies I had were from a bakery called Konditor and Cook in London. Pod has since raised more than pound, for Crisis, a charity which helps homeless people in London. Pod said: The reception I have had from the challenge has been incredible and overwhelming. I chose this charity because homelessness is on the rise and it felt particularly important around this time of year with the weather getting colder.   It must be incredibly dficult living on streets, with people getting festive and jolly all around you for Christmas. If I give a someone homeless some food, it might be a sweet treat like a mince pie, evenits not something they wont eat, they may have no choice. I thought it would be an interesting challenge for me mentally and physically, not to suggest I have it as bad as someone whos homeless, but limiting my diet will make me understand what its like to have no food choices. He chronicled his journey on his Instagram page SuperPiesMe to raise money for homelessness charity Crisis and is scoffing about ten a day. People can donate to Pods challenge until January  by visiting www.justgiving fundraising superpiesme.

After seeing his mums reaction to the terrying reality check, he decided it was time to do something about it. He enlisted the help of personal trainer Mike Hind, who knew desperate action was needed to make Darren, known as Dibsy, change his ways. So he printed off leaflets with the message Save Dibsy. Obesity is killing him. Do not serve this man alongside a photo of him. And it seems the drastic move worked, as Darren, , has now dropped an incredible st in just two and a half months.  Hes taken up exercise and is now eating , a day. He said: Instead of picking the healthy option I would always go for what I liked, stuff like pies, pasties, crisps and chips. It got to the point where my legs and back were aching all the time and I ended up in hospital. The doctor asked meI want to live a long le and said I cant go on the way I am or Id be dead before too long. Seeing my mums reaction to it all was heartbreaking,it wasnt for that I might never have changed.  I have had a lot of finger pointing and laughing over the years and I was bullied at school. Thats another reason for making a change now, so that I can live a normal le. The dramatic change has meant Darren was able to attend his first Middlesbrough match in seven years. Fans in the crowd even spotted him and people in the street stopped him for selfies and a chat. Much of Dibsys progress is thanks to personal trainer Mike, who takes on a client for free once a year.  He received around a thousand applications but was drawn to Dibsy when he saw him with his mum. As well as strict fitness regime Mike is also providing fully tailored and prepared meals for his new client everyday. He said: Dibsy is a great guy but unfortunately he hasnt taken care of himself properly. I was really affected by his story and motivated to help him so he can turn his le around.

The sisters-in-law are at the Queens Sandringham estate in Norfolk with the rest of the royal family. But newlyweds Meghan and Harry are staying at the main Sandringham estate, rather than nearby Anmer Hall, with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The Queen arrived at Sandringham on Thursday, travelling down by train to King’s Lynn station. Teenage Meghan Markle sings Santa Baby in newly-uncovered Christmas footageHer Majesty and Prince Philip were then joined by other members of the royal family - but there is a strict system. James Brookes, royal commentator at Royal Central, told the Express: “As with other royal engagements and visits, there’s a pecking order. “The more junior members of the family arrive first, with the senior royal following.”  So Meghan and Harry arrived before Kate and William, as they are more junior members of the family. Prince Harry, Kate, Prince Charles and Camilla are likely to be the last to arrive ahead of the Christmas Eve festivities. A Sandringham Christmas is rich in tradition. Last night, the royals enjoyed a formal black-tie dinner. In a nod to their German heritage, presents are opened on Christmas Eve. Today starts with breakfast – for the royal women it is breakfast in bed as the men eat together downstairs.  The family then walk to the Norfolk estate’s St Mary Magdalene Church for the service, where they are greeted by a throng of well-wishers. The family sit at pm for shrimp salad, turkey with all the trimmings and Christmas pudding with brandy butter. After lunch, all watch the Queen’s speech.  In the evening each has a one-on-one chat with the monarch. On Boxing Day, the family take part in a pheasant shoot. In a new ITV documentary  Meghan - The Story So Far , royal biographer Andrew Morton revealed that when Kate becomes Queen, Meghan will have to curtsy in her presence. The revelation was explained in the Tonight special, where Morton speaks candidly about Meghans current role in the royal family. He said: Kate has established herself as the future Queen.  At the end of the day, Meghan will be curtsying to Catherine, because she will be the Queen. Meghan will always be just a junior member, albeit a very popular one, of the royal family.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markles dad spends christmas","story":"NewsMeghan Markles dad spends Christmas ALONE as Duchess heads to SandringhamLonely Thomas Markle Snr will spend the day in Mexico as Meghan Markle celebrates Christmas with the Royal Family in NorfolkShareCommentsByChris kitching:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror tv video thomas-markle-admits-hes-been-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markles dad Thomas Snr is spending Christmas Day alone at home in Mexico as she attends a lavish gathering with the Royal Family.

Meghan, who is due to give birth in the spring, and Harry, , will join the Queen and others at Sandringham in Norfolk on her first Christmas as a member of the Royal Family. Royal fans gathered outside the estate overnight to get a prime spot to catch a glimpse of the family as they attend a Christmas morning church service.  All eyes will be on US-born Meghan and Kate Middleton amid claims of tension between the two royal wives. Mr Markle has faced criticism for doing repeated interviews about his row with his daughter.

In the announcement, made by Kensington Palace, it was said the child will be born in Spring . But since then, the Palace has been very careful not to give away any more information about the birth.  This hasnt stopped people from speculating about the Duchess of Sussexs due date - with one beauty expert recently coming up with a way to work it out for ourselves. Jane Mayhead, Senior Trichology Consultant at The Private Clinic of Harley Street, told Express that the clue is in Meghans hair. She said: In a number of recent images of Meghan, her hair certainly appears much fuller than before the pregnancy and its possible that this is due to changing hormone levels. The increased levels of hormones during pregnancy can cause the growth cycle of the hair to increase, meaning the hair is less frequently renewed and replaced at the site of the follicle and women will experience thicker and shinier hair.  Jane continued that many pregnant women find their hair becomes more voluminous two thirds of the way through their pregnancy. I tend to find that most women will experience some level of increased volume by around the six month mark. If she is correct about this, then it means Meghan could have her baby in late February or early March. This will be earlier than thought, as many have speculated the baby will be born in April.  However pregnancy may not be the only thing having an impact on Meghans hair - she may have changed her hair care routine to protect her baby. She added: There are, of course, other possibilities to consider. It is highly likely that Meghan may also be avoiding putting harsh chemicals in her hair. Moreover she could have changed her diet to include an intake of folic acid, which is particularly good for hair growth.

The calender does state for cats on the front but be honest who reads a calendar that was put on the same shelf as the chocolate ones presumably by a customer.I didnt pick it up down the cat section and think to myself this will do. Alissa had eaten four of the chocolates before deciding she couldnt stomach any more - but she is fine. Telling the story earlier, Jess, who lives in Oswestry, Shropshire, said: I was in shock and felt like the worst mother ever when I realised Id bought her a calendar for cats. She said they tasted a bit strange, but hadnt said they were horrible, so I just forgot about it.  The -year-old continued: Alissa hadnt been eating them for a few days and when I asked why she brought the box over to me. When I turned the calendar over and read it was yoghurt and catnip flavour I couldnt believe it - and that it had taken  days for us to notice. I have a degree in English literature and creative writing but still couldnt read a calendar. The mum purchased the pound. advent calendar from the Oswestry branch of BM while out shopping with Alissa and her younger sisters Alexis Davies-Evans, three and -month-old Aurora Davies-Evans.   She says she got the younger girls Peppa Pig and My Little Pony advent calendars, but wanted to find a dferent one for her eldest child.

The distressed Staffordshire bull terrier, now called Snoop, tried to get back inside the vehicle as it was abandoned in Stoke-on-Trent just days before Christmas.

She said: “The footage has to be seen to be believed, it’s just awful. To see the poor dog in such obvious distress jumping up at the car as it drives away it just heartbreaking. I can’t understand how someone could do this.  “The vets scanned his microchip and we have traced two previous owners in the Birmingham area, but do not believe either are the current owners, and therefore not those responsible for abandoning the dog. “One man can be seen clearly in the footage dumping the dog, and there is a second person in the driver seat of the car. I am very keen to hear from anyone who recognises the vehicle, the man or the dog. “The veterinary staff have nicknamed the dog Snoop, and he is in good condition, thought to be two years old. He is a white Staffie with black marking, and is such a friendly, lovely boy.

Shocking footage has emerged of a blue Citroen ramming into cars while people slam shopping trolleys into it outside the supermarket in Rickmansworth. The chaotic video shows several people surrounding the car which is driving very erratically in an apparent attempt to flee. Hertfordshire Police believe the driver and the passenger were involved in an incident inside the store... where a person was challenged by the store’s security after attempting to steal alcohol. The car already has damage to a wing mirror when the video starts with it reversing and ramming into a car as a bystander shouts for the driver to stop. Did you see this incident  Email webnews@mirror  It then reverses again and people shout for the driver to get out and throw trolleys into the driver-side door repeatedly. The door opens before the people surrounding say it might be better to just leave him in there. The driver then makes an aggressive manoeuvre through several parked cars, setting off alarms.  Thats when the damage to the rear window of the hired Citroen becomes clear. A man with what appears to be a metal bar gestures at the driver behind the wheel. The car then manages to wriggle free and flees the scene.  Hertfordshire Police have appealed for information. A statement by the force on Facebook said: At .pm December  police were called to a report of a car being in collision with several people outside the Tesco store in Harefield Road, Rickmansworth. The ambulance service also attended the incident. One person was taken to Watford General Hospital after sustaining a serious injury. Another person sustained slight injuries and also received hospital treatment.  The vehicle – a blue Citroen C, a hire car with a registration of KW HGK – did not stop, but left the scene. It’s believed the driver and passenger were involved in an incident inside the store moments before the collision, where a person was challenged by the store’s security after attempting to steal alcohol. Officers are continuing to work to locate the vehicle and its occupants. Tesco have declined to comment.

While some people don their fanciest frocks and do the rounds to see loved ones, for others the perfect day involves tuning into the Christmas TV specials in Father Christmas PJs. Just like the rest of us, the Royal Family come together to spend the special day together - and a lot of their traditions arent too much dferent to the ones us normal folk enjoy. They tuck into a big turkey dinner , eat Christmas cake and exchange presents. But there also a few extra special traditions thrown in there - well, they are royal after all.  Heres a full step-by-step guide to what the Royal Family get up to on Christmas Day. Christmas Eve Afternoon tea Once the family have all arrived and unpacked, they gather for afternoon tea. Its believed to be a formal occasion, with the men in black tie and the women wearing gowns and jewels. Opening presents To incorporate their German heritage into the festivities, the family open their presents on Christmas Eve as is traditional in the country. Shortly after they arrive they all lay their gts out on dferent tables, so each guest has their own little pile. Prince Philip oversees organising the gts and tells everyone when they can open them. The family exchange cheap joke presents, and in the past Kate bought Harry a Grow your Own Girlfriend Kit and the Prince got his granny a Les a B**** shower cap.  Christmas Day Breakfast The royals kick off the big day with breakfast, but many of the couples split up for the first festive meal. According to former royal chef Darren McGrady the women tend to eat in their rooms while the men sit together downstairs. Speaking to the Daily Mail, he said: On Christmas Day, the ladies generally opt for a light breakfast of sliced fruit, half a grapefruit, toast and coffee delivered to their rooms. The men on the other hand have a much heartier breakfast, usually including eggs, bacon, mushrooms, kippers and grilled kidneys. Church The public get to see the Royals when they head out to a traditional Christmas Day church service at St Mary Magdalene. Hundreds of well-wishers usually gather to see them as they walk into the building, and they often stop to have a chat on the way out. Trips to Church is the only time the Queen carries cash, and she normally pops either a fiver or a tenner in the collection pot - but it could be more at Christmas.  Christmas lunch The festive feast is the main event in most homes on Christmas Day, and its no dferent for the Royals who site down to eat at pm. Former royal chef Darren McGrady revealed exactly what the Queen eats during an interview with Good Housekeeping . He said: After church, thats when they have a big lunch that includes a salad with shrimp or lobster, and a roasted turkey, and all of your traditional side dishes like parsnips, carrots, Brussels sprouts, and Christmas pudding with brandy butter for dessert. They stick with the same meal year after year. Sounds delicious!  The Queens Speech Yep, thats right - just like the rest of us the Royal Family sit down and watch grannys speech on the BBC at pm. Its prerecorded which means the Queen can watch it back surrounded by her loved ones. Afternoon tea After the speech they all go off for a bit of free time, before gathering again for afternoon tea and a slice of Christmas fruit cake. Chats with the Queen According to former royal butler Paul Burrell, all the royals like to have a one-to-one chat with the Queen during the day, but theres one popular time to do it. Before Princess Dianas first royal Christmas, he advised her to try and get some quality time with the monarch when she was sitting at her card table. Speaking to the Mail Online, he said: All these people are members of the royal family, they are all larger than le, have character to go with it. Everyone is jostling for position and attention, and theyre bouncing off the walls after four days. Its like a pinball machine. They all want to please the Queen and want airtime with her, its the one time that they can sit down with the head of the family and make an impression.  Its what I said to Diana when she first came into the family, try to get airtime with the Queen, speak into her ear. The best time to do it is when shes seated at her card table, before and after dinner, she will sit and play Bridge or Canasta and shell always ask people to join her, thats your chance to get quality time and tell the monarch what youre thinking and feeling. Dinner Before long its time for ANOTHER meal, and the royal chefs put on an evening buffet for dinner. Former chef Darren McGrady said theres a buffet dinner with - dferent items. Its always a buffet with the chefs at the table carving. Before they all tuck in the senior chef goes into the dining room and carves the meat. Once hes done, the Queen gives him a glass of whiskey and they toast. Its the only time the chef is invited into the dining room. He also revealed that the Queen has a real penchant for chocolate, particularly the dark and minty iety. Apparently she always has a chocolate treat on Christmas. Boxing Day The next day the family will head on on their annual Boxing Day pheasant hunt. Prince Harry, who has been taking part in the tradition for about  years, will be skipping it this year to keep his new we Meghan happy.  One Royal source told the Sunday Mirror: William sees this as another concerning example of his brother being pulled away from his family by his new we. Harrys always loved hunting and it has provided them with a great chance to bond as brothers. But now it looks like Harrys shooting days are over. Its the latest point of contention between the Princes. Some of the family leave the estate to visit other relatives on Boxing Day. The Cambridges, for example, will head off to celebrate with Kates family, where they enjoy another busy day of festive fun.

A bizarre, disappointing or wholly inappropriate gt can make it a holiday to remember for all the wrong reasons. The wrong gt can lead to awkward moments at the family dinner table or big problems between lovers, unless the recipient manages to swallow their disappointment and fake being excited. With another festive season upon us, these are some of the worst or saddest Christmas gts people have ever received - including a sex toy from a father-in-law and a second-hand jumper with a heartbreaking back story. The hilarious or shocking examples were compiled from a list of recent Reddit threads, where Internet users were asked to reveal their Christmas horror stories, as well as submissions from staff of Reach PLC, the Mirrors parent company.  Knickers... from an aunt and uncle Its one thing to get sexy underwear from a partner . Its another to get undergarments from a family member. One woman has told how her aunt and uncle gave her a pair of knickers on Christmas Day when she was . She wrote on Reddit: When I was about  my aunt and uncle bought me one pair of red and black lacy nylon knickers. The static alone was lethal never mind anything . The gt has stayed in her mind for years, but it hasnt ruined her Christmas spirit.  The Reddit user, named RogueCandyKane, added: I honestly can’t single out a best gt as I love most gts and for me it’s the actual opening that’s the fun bit and finding out what’s in there - it kills me not knowing what I’m getting. Another user, handikat, said her grandmother gave her a gt card for a lingerie store - and forced her -year-old brother to go in and buy it. She wrote: The f***ed up part wasnt the gt itself, but the fact that she made my poor  year old brother go in and buy it. As he told it, the conversation went something like this. Cashier: shopping for your girlfriend  Brother: no, my sister... well my grandma... Awkward silence. Toilet brush A woman called Anna told : My hubby gave me the Merdolina toilet brush. I didnt find it funny. Despite this, the married couples relationship hasnt gone down the drain - they are still happily together. A sex toy from the father-in-law  Reddit user stilesja got more than he bargained for when he played a game of Dirty Santa at his first Christmas with his wes family. He said: Her dad takes it seriously and gets adult themed presents, but he is the only one. I just happen to pick his gt bag. Its a dildo and a porno with anal in the title. It got stolen from me later, but then I showed them all by stealing it back in the last round. It sits in my night stand now  years later and I still poke my we in the butt and ask hershe wants to try her dads dildo from time to time. Nappies from the mother-in-law Another user, mommysababy, told of a bizarre gt from her now ex-mother-in-law. She said: For Christmas my ex mother in law got my husband an Xbox. She got me a box of diapers. Like I was grateful but not really a gt for me. Rude T-shirts lost in translation  Sometimes, a bizarre gt comes from a good place. In the case of Redditor wheelchair_boxing, it was a T-shirt from his step-dads mother, who didnt understand the message printed on it. It was a shirt that had Im not a gynecologist but Ill take a look anyway. It was from my stepdads mom. She knows I want to be a doctor and her English is no bueno. I found it hilarious. Once we translated it to her she almost cried from embarrassment. I proudly wore it for the rest of the day. Reddit user Lady shared a similar story: Haha, a similar thing happened to me. One of my sisters friends was in the earlier stages of learning English, and she knows I love animals. So she got me a cute little shirt that said I like my boyfriend but I LOVE my beaver! I was  at the time so I had no idea. My sister told me the story a few years later, and we still give the poor girl hell about it. Power tools A woman called Michelle told : My ex got me an electric sander one Christmas - even though I’d shown absolutely no interest in ‘sanding’ anything... ever. But he had a history of getting pretty bad presents in general. Surprise, youre adopted! Reddit user AngryCyclops was stunned when they unwrapped a gt and found a book. They wrote: I got a book called Coping with Being Adopted from Santa while I was in high school. Was news to me... Mouse mat... but no computer  A mouse mat likely ranks among the most underwhelming gts ever. It can be specialits customised with a beloved photo. But one person received a mouse mat when they didnt even have a computer. Reddit user GildedFire explained: “One year when I was a kid, my parents bought me a computer mouse. What makes it bad is that I didnt have a computer, and had been asking for one for years. They added: And it wasnt a cheap thing, my parents were always really well off. In fact, we had a spare computer sitting in a closet. My parents just really didnt want me to have my own computer. Still not sure why they got me the mouse though. Just seems like a, f*** you. This would have made it even worse: Used jumper Christmas can be a tough time for those down on their luck. The holiday is far more extravagant and expensive than ever, and that means some people come close to breaking the bank while others cant afford to spoil their loved ones like they want to. A Reddit user named RoCath revealed a heartbreaking story from a past Christmas, where their mum did their best to give them something special. The woman wrote: My worst present was a horrible Christmas sweater that my mom got from Goodwill. It was hideous, but she honestly thought it was beautul. She was going through hard times, so I had to pretend to be really excited about it. Regted presents  The term regting will live on in pop culture lore thanks to the TV sitcom Seinfeld. Reddit user SquatChick immediately caught on when an aunt gave her expired chocolate that had melted while lavishing expensive gts on her own children. She wrote: Not only was the chocolate expired, but it was also evident that it had melted completely and resolidied. When I noticed, I went up to her with, OMG, this chocolate is soooo good, you have to try it! in front of the whole family. I watched her unwrap a piece of chocolate and when she noticed how it looked, she was hesitant to eat it. When she looked at me, I just had a smile on my face. Its the best chocolate ever! And then I watched her slowly bring it to her mouth and try to eat it. She quickly walked to the kitchen immediately afterwards. I think Ive only seen her once since that moment almost  years ago. A hoover and a dog after heart surgery One woman, Melanie, toldabout a tale involving her grandparents. The grandmother had quadruple heart surgery and a doctor told the grandfather that he needed to help out more around the house. Their granddaughter, Melanie, said: So for Christmas he bought her a less cumbersome lightweight hoover. She added: He was also told Nan needed to walk more, so rather than offer to accompany her, he got a dog. Bunny pyjamas from A Christmas Story   Britons may not be familiar with the  cult film A Christmas Story, which is played in heavy rotation in the US every December. In one memorable scene, nine-year-old Ralphie Parker receives a pink bunny pyjama suit - complete with floppy ears and slippers - from his Aunt Clara. The dejected boy is forced to put it on and when he comes downstairs he looks like someone has told him the truth about Santa Claus. The suit is a real thing - it sells for pound online - and its been disappointing children all over, apparently. One Reddit user wrote: My parents got me the pink bunny outfit from the Christmas story when I was about  or . I hated it then but looking back at it the outfit was pretty funny. Wallaby and wild boar meat A man called David toldabout a gaffe by a pal. He said: A close pal of mine about  years ago decided to get his then-girlfriend, now we, a very special gt. Her dad was a chef and caterer and she had developed his passion for cooking. So my pal thought rather than the usual clothes or perfumes, this year he would get her a unique present to match her interest in cooking. He sent off for a selection of exotic meats from a mail order firm. The package duly arrived, but unfortunately his girlfriend was not enamoured to open her present to find dferent cuts of wallaby and wild boar. Less so when she had to cook most of them over the holiday.

The astonishing Christmas walk in the Khabarovsk region, Russia meant that the three-year-old saved himself from certain death.

He left the boy on the bank of the River Gur, some , miles east of Moscow, as he turned the snowmobile but it fell into the fast flowing river because the ice was not as thick as he had expected. The boy - not yet named - said his father shouted to him: “Son, run to the shop” before he went under. The family own a shop in Kenay village in Khabarovsk region - and the boy obediently followed his father’s final instruction.  Head of the village administration Yury Anekhov said: “The child saw his father sinking. “The boy later told me that his father shouted to him: Son, run to the shop!. “They have their own shop in the village, and Yevgeny told him to go there. “The boy climbed a hillock, and then came down from it - its height is about  metres . “Then he walked through the taiga.” The boy followed the tracks of his father’s snowmobile but then lost the path, reported The Siberian Times. He was walking in a temperature of minus C - colder than ever recorded in Britain. He mistakenly took a wrong track but by chance was spotted by a local man who used it as a shortcut.  The man said: “He doesn’t speak too well yet - he’s too young - so he couldn’t tell me what happened. “I just understood that it was something really bad, and rushed to the village to find his family.” The man said: “The little one was so smart. He had figured that the way back home was to follow the traces of his dad’s snowmobile.” He reunited the boy with his mother Maria. A day later the child succumbed to a “very strong fever”, he said. Vlasov was a successful local businessman owning a chain of shops. Local police chief Alexander Kolomytsev said that the chances of finding the body were slight. It was a “fast mountain river” and was impossible to use ers in the search.

They’ll be huge for us.”To add to the Dark Blues’ woes, St Mirren picked up a victory at Motherwell to leave them three points adrt at the foot of the ision.Adding points to his own team’s total is more important to Jim, however – as is bringing in new faces next month.“What St Mirren do isn’t our concern,” Jim added.“It’s all about what we do and we have to make sure we continue to just think about ourselves.“The transfer window is going to be important for all of the clubs at the bottom, it’s an opportunity to try to get players in to help the ones we already have.”The Dark Blues did hold out against a dominant Celtic for almost the entire first half with his team’s organisation pleasing the manager, though the manner of the opening goal didn’t.He said: “It was a deserved scoreline.“Celtic were very good, their movement was so fluid, they caused us loads of problems.“I thought our organisation defensively was very good for  minutes but concentration levels are so important.“The timing of the goal and our player stopping for offside was the key disappointment.“It was onside, our video boy confirmed at half-time it was onside, so that was disappointing, just play to the whistle and argue about it later.“A couple of minutes before half-time you’re looking to get in at - and regroup, try to address where Celtic were hurting us.“In the second half Celtic were just too good for us, simple as that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bin collection plans change for christmas","story":"Councils across Tayside and Fe have announced changes to recycling schedules during the festive period.Dundee City Council carried out collections today – and will do so again on Hogmanay – as normal.However, all other collections will be running a day behind over the Christmas and New Year weeks.It means that collections planned for Tuesday will take place on Wednesday instead, with New Year’s Day collections put back until January .Collections will also be held on Saturday instead of Friday.The city council’s recycling centres will also have dferent opening hours.A spokesman said: “The recycling centres at Riverside and Baldovie will be closed tomorrow and Wednesday, and on Tuesday January  and Wednesday January .“The centres will be open am-.pm on all other days .“Please note a permit system is in place for certain types of vehicles.“The Riverside composting site will be closed tomorrow and Wednesday, and on Tuesday January  and Wednesday January .”Special waste uplts have been suspended until Monday January .In Angus the council says there will be no collections on Christmas Day, Boxing Day, New Year’s Day or January .Residents have been encouraged to visit the Angus Council website to check revised collection plans for specic addresses.Perth and Kinross Council will operate a similar scheme to the one in Angus, with collections suspended tomorrow and Wednesday and the same days next week, with information available on its website about revised collection plans.Fe Council’s bin collection schemes also dfer based on location, with residents able to download calendars from the council’s website which offer specic information about their address."},{"url":null,"title":"cafe staff doing their buttie at christmas to show dundee is an amazing place","story":"A Dundee takeaway is to offer free food and drink to the less fortunate on Christmas Day.Butties  on Albert Street will be open for business at .am when it will hand out free soup, hot rolls, tea and coffee to people in need.Manageress Sharon Tait, , said the shop had been planning the gesture since November in an effort to give a little back to the community.She added: “This is the first year we have decided to do this.“I’ve always wanted to volunteer at the soup kitchens in Dundee over Christmas.“Having a young family that hadn’t always been possible but they’ve grown up now.“I spoke to our director Ian Tait, and he was up for doing it.“It will only be the Stobswell premises that will be open but four of us will be in until am.”Sharon said the response they’ve had to the shop opening has been excellent, with plenty of donations coming in from suppliers and other businesses.She added: “We’ve already had donations from the Booker Group, Broxburn Browns and Pam’s Flowers.“The post that was put up on social media was shared more than , times.“I have been overwhelmed by the response.

I know what it is like over here from my time with Aston Villa,” he said.“In Switzerland last weekend it was the last game and now every one of my friends is on holiday. They are all sending me pictures so I block them on social media. I’m only kidding, for me it is just nice to be playing.“There is not one bit of jealously, I would rather be here and playing football over Christmas than be on holiday with them.“For me as a foreigner having been involved in the English game and now the Scottish game, I think it is beautul to be playing at this time of year.“You spend time with your family on Christmas Day but Boxing Day it is back into training to prepare for the next game and that’s what I like. We are playing today and then the th, there is no midweek game so it is perfect.“Listen, I live for playing football, I live and breathe football, so for me there is nothing better than having Christmas and then a game right away.”And, for Siegrist, the best Christmas presents he’ll get will be maximum points from Falkirk and Alloa.If United go about their business the way they did up at Inverness last weekend, he believes they will do exactly that.Although that Highland trip saw them have to fight back to earn a point, he believes the level of performance bodes well for what lies ahead in the league programme.“You never know what that point is worth until you finish the season, so that might be a very good one. However, the gaffer spoke about it to us during the week and the way we played compared to the week before at Morton was miles better.“That’s the way we want to play and we believe it gives us the best chance of winning every game or at least most of the games.“You are not going to walk through this league but we like to play with high tempo, pass the ball and cause problems for the opposition we can take advantage of. We just need to put it all together and get the three points.“We should be full of confidence the way we played last week because we know not every opposition can withstand the pressure we put on them.“It’s all about our performance, the way we go on the pitch and put into practice what we think we want to do.“The ability we have in the dressing-room, the characters we have, I think we have a really good team whether that’s in terms of spirit or ability.”After injury forced him off in the recent defeat against Ayr and forced him to miss the draw at Morton, Siegrist admits being recalled to the line-up last weekend was a boost for him.So far this term, one of his biggest battles has been to claim a starting place ahead of Matej Rakovan but that was an indication he’s now considered the first choice keeper by boss Robbie Neilson.“I’ve kind of over-extended when I was ing in the game against Ayr and it was a mixture between a knock and a muscle injury. It happens in football, you get injured sometimes and I was happy I was playing again as soon as I was back fit.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c20bd7a2c622-376x564.jpg ","title":"everyone should be treated the same dundee boy kayden has a gift for giving","story":"A Dundee primary school pupil has delved into his own pocket to prove he really does know the true meaning of Christmas.Nine-year-old Kayden Smith, from St Mary’s, who is a pupil at St Fergus RC Primary, has given up his own pocket money to buy food for people who are less well-off.He saved up £ a week and spent £ at the supermarket to help others during the festive period.Kayden said: “Every week for four weeks I went shopping with my grandma and bought food for other people who might be hungry.

Here it is, in full, below.Congratulations on your purchase of Dundee United. I guess the obvious first question is why Dundee United My son Scott and I have been looking for investment in European football for some time. We looked at a lot of dferent options, and we looked at this particular club, the club#s history, the support of the fans, the previous success and rich history.The Irish history appealed because we are of Irish descent. We know the Club had financial issues and that makes it dficult for any Club to be successful.For the Club staff to work within that scenario where there is financial dficulty, you are hampered by that. Decisions are then based on where you are at rather than the best interests of the Club. We felt it was a sleeping giant and we could come in with our advisors and use our business experience to make a dference and get Dundee United back where it needs to be.How much did buying United cost you I will not answer that question directly but what I will say is I have seen some numbers thrown about out there and I wish we were buying it for as little as that! It comes to a combination of money paid to shareholders, money put in for the retirement of debt and a commitment to working capital to ensure funds going forward to do what we need to do to be successful.How long has buying a sporting opportunity in Europe been an interest or passion for you It has been there for several years. Scott#s passion for European football goes back much longer than that. It was his passion that rubbed off on me. His English team is Newcastle United, and we caught a match a few years back and had a lot of fun. In the last year, we really took the interest seriously.Are you looking to make money from this deal Yes. This isn#t a hobby for us, and we expect to make money long-term but, let me say, for that to happen we need to be competing in the Ladbrokes Premiership on a continual basis.How much do you know about Dundee United and Scottish football I know a ton. We spent a tremendous amount of time and money doing our due diligence. Legally, on the business side and on the performance side. We know a lot about Dundee United, and we have researched Scottish football, and we know where we are and where we want to go. We have an excellent plan to get where we want to go.Do you expect to own Dundee United for several years Yes. I expect to own the team long-term.What would you say to reassure Dundee United fans about the long-term future of the Club I guess what I would say is based on the due diligence conducted, spending a lot of time and money researching, we know what we are getting into. This isn#t just a passing fancy where we are going to get in and discover something that would create any issues for us. We are confident about what we are getting into and where we want to go. We would not invest in the Clubwe weren#t convinced about the long-term future of the Club.How does this purchase affect the structure of the Club Mike Martin has stepped down as Chairman, and I would like to recognise the work Mike has done during the process. He is a big fan of the Club, and he has steadied the ship since his appointment in March.As new owners, we are going to take it in a dferent direction. We plan to appoint a Managing Director who will be in charge of running the Club and he will be responsible for the aspects of the commercial and business side of the Club.We will also have a Sporting Director who will be responsible for all the performance aspects of the Club. He will work with Robbie Neilson efficiently and effectively from the Club’s standpoint.We will be making some announcements in the very near future regarding this.What type of Chairman would you describe yourself So I’ll be the Chairman and my son Scott will be the quasi-Vice Chairman. He will sit on the board with me. From a Club perspective, people can expect that I#ll be interested in all that is going on I will be very supportive of what#s going on and who is doing it I will be available whenever, but I will not be a micro-manager. We will have what we think are the right persons in the right positions to be a successful Club and I will absolutely expect results.From a fan perspective, I will be a low profile Chairman and fans will hear more from the Club leadership in the new structure than they will from me.Do you plan to work remotely Yes. I will work remotely and travel over as much as possible. Scott and I have talked about this. We will have board meetings that we will come over for, but we will try to tag-team and come across at separate times, so at least one of us is here as often as possible.How can you get a feel for the Clubyou aren#t over in Dundee With today#s technology it is almost asyou are over there but having the right people in the right positions is what matters. Jimmy Fyffe and David Dorward are still on the board, and we anticipate one or two other people to be on the board from the Dundee area. It is essential for the fans to know we will definitely have local representation and they will be in constant communications.There are American owners at Dundee FC, also within the city. So let me ask this directly. Do you have any plans to merge the clubs No. None whatsoever.Do you have any links at all with the owners of Dundee FC No, I have never met them, and quite frankly I do not even know who they are.Do you have any links to the previous owners of the Club including Stephen Thompson No, I have heard his name, but I have never met or had a discussion with Stephen Thompson. Obviously, I have met Mike Martin and Jimmy Fyffe.You have an interest in a Baseball team. What experience have you gained that will stand you in good stead for a football team based in Dundee I believe firmly, that a person needs to know their limitations. As Chairman and owner that is the situation. As far as performance of the squad aspect of the Club is concerned, I expect to be consulted with, I will be involved and interested in decisions, but in reality, I will defer the main decisions to those that know the game much better than I do. As I said previously, I#m not going to micro-manage. I expect to be much more involved in the business side.Have you spoken to the Head Coach and can you confirm that you see him leading the team forward So when I travelled across recently, I was introduced to Robbie, but quite frankly I don#t even think he knew who I was! I just happened to be a visitor who was introduced. That#s been the extent so far, but in answer to your question, I absolutely do believe he is the man to lead the team forward. He has made a positive impact since his arrival, and he has proven himself with Hearts before.Will he be given financial backing to help in the task of getting the Club back into the Ladbrokes Premiership I guess what I’d say is that it is not an open chequebook, but we absolutely intend to invest the necessary funds to get us into a position to get promoted. Equally important is when we get up we stay there.You will appreciate supporters will be curious and apprehensive about motives. How do you plan to communicate with fans of Dundee United Talk is cheap. What I would say to our supporters is judge us by our actions and, even more importantly judge us on our results. Obviously, due to the structure that I#ve discussed earlier, we will be implementing changes, and the fans will hear from the Club leadership rather than me.What targets do you intend to set for the team and the Club as a whole Let me answer it this way. We are looking at short-term and longer-term targets. The short-term objective is simple # promotion to the Premiership. We expect it is this year absolutely. We need to be United and have the one vision, # success # and get to the Premiership. The timing of the transaction is excellent. We have a transfer window shortly in January, and this will allow us to get with Robbie and figure out the team, andwe need to make some changes, we are ready and willing to do that.Longer-term, maybe three to five years, we need to be competing in the top six of the Premiership. We want to be competing in European competition and challenging in the cups. That#s our ultimate goal."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-wagamama-staff-have-spring-in-their-step-after-christmas-bonus-announcement","story":"Staff at three Glasgow restaurants are over the moon after finding out they will be given Christmas bonuses worth up to pound,."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-star-leigh-griffiths-returns-to-social-media","story":"CELTIC ace Leigh Grfiths has broken his social media silence for the first time since stepping away from the club due to ongoing personal issues."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-and-australias-argument-over-tom-rogic-is-a-real-soap-opera","story":"GRAHAM Arnold was granted face-time with Brendan Rodgers on his recent visit to Scotland and came away unexpectedly with an extra player in Martin Boyle."},{"url":null,"title":"airnbnb-glasgow-city-council-bans-estate-agent-from-running-holiday-let","story":"AN estate agent has been banned from running an Airbnb let in a residential block on Glasgowrsquos West End in a landmark case."},{"url":null,"title":"deliveroo-glasgow-delivery-drivers-sacked-en-masse-just-days-before-christmas","story":"TWENTY courier drivers have been sacked just days before Christmas after being accused of fraud by a worldwide delivery service."},{"url":null,"title":"as-the-world-was-partying-we-were-welcoming-babies-meet-the-staff-in-charge-of-glasgows-festive-deliveries","story":"WHILE most of us are opening presents and tucking into turkey, staff at Glasgowrsquos maternity hospitals will be making sure the cityrsquos very special Christmas deliveries have a safe arrival.

May ran with real intent down the left flank before lting a cross into the heart of the penalty box.The delivery was met by COSGROVE who brilliantly directed a header into the far corner beyond keeper Colin Doyle who was at full stretch.Aberdeen looked dangerous on the attack and came close in the eighth minute when Niall McGinn fired wide at the near post from  yards.Soon after McGinn controlled the ball on his chest, let it drop then volleyed at goal from  yards but straight at keeper Doyle.In the th minute the Dons had a goal chalked off when a looping cross from Shay Logan on the right drted into the far corner. Referee John Beaton disallowed it as Lewis Ferguson appeared to make contact with the keeper on the line.On the half-hour mark Hearts opted to go short with a free- kick and keeper Joe Lewis had to produce a superb save to deny Steven MacLean.Aberdeen suffered a blow in the th minute when on-loan Derby County left-back Max Lowe was taken off after pulling up with a calf injury. He looks set to miss the clash with Celtic.His replacement was -year-old Dean Campbell who moved to midfield with Shinnie dropping to left-back. With Campbell and Lewis Ferguson, , the Dons had two teenagers in the midfield engine room.The Reds increased their advantage in the th minute when McGinn flighted a free-kick into the box and Scott McKenna was dragged to the ground by Christophe Berra.COSGROVE stepped up and clinically converted.Moments later there was a flash-point in front of the dug-outs when Naismith appeared to trample on Ferguson’s calf as the teen was lying on the pitch.There was a melee in the aftermath with a number of players involved.Referee Beaton booked Naismith and Dons substitute Stephen Gleeson.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 48","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCongratulations are due to a number of local people this week.We#re surrounded by heroes every day, most of whom are unsung, but David MacInnes was quite rightly recognised last week for his work in boosting the cause of stem cell research and donation.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta.

Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

The combination of problems forced the family to live in the bedroom of their house where the damp was less severe.After seven months of negotiating, Gary and Lindsay have moved out of the house into a privately let property close to Oban.At the time ACHA chief executive Alastair McGregor said: ‘The association will provide compensation through our redress policy to Mr Smith for his inconvenience. The association is committed to getting this matter concluded as soon as possible and for Mr Smith and his family to enjoy the facilities in their new home in the very near future.’In a letter to Mr McGregor, Gary said: ‘I am disgusted the way me and my family have been treated. If this is what you call habitable condition I wouldn’t like to see what ACHA classes as inhabitable.’Since the Argyllshire Advertiser published the article, Gary maintains the holes in the side of the building have not been filled, the damp not dealt with, nor has black mould in the bedroom.He said: #When they got someone to look at it he just wanted to plaster over the problem. That won#t solve the damp in the whole house. I guarantee when we leave they#ll just plaster over it and give it to someone .#When asked about the family#s situation and lack of movement on it, Alastair McGregor said: #Once the current tenancy has ended, we will be investigating further to ensure the issues are completely resolved. With respect to the boreholes, this is not work that is incomplete. We are currently carrying out investigations and that is why they are open.#ACHA was not aware of any problems with the property at the point of letting and we would never knowingly let a property which was not wind and watertight.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a christmas thought for the week","story":"Marilyn SheddenUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis Sunday will be the fourth Sunday in Advent and it is traditionally the time for nativity plays.There are many stories of children ad-libbing and parents cringing as the youngsters make up their own words when they go #off script#.One of my favourites is about the wee boy who looked into the crib and said: #Isn#t he like his dad #The congregation laughed, as they knew these were not the scripted words – but had this wee boy not just got the gospel in a nutshell He had heard his mum say this of the new baby next door, so he thought it an appropriate thing to say.How right he was.#Isn#t he like his dad # Is this not the message of Christmas Of course, we do not know what Jesus looked like physically, but that doesn#t matter. #Isn#t he like his dad #Jesus came to show us what God was like and from the very beginning God set the stage of his nativity.Jesus was born in poverty, a refugee without a place to live, so his parents borrowed the lowliest of places – so the story goes.Jesus# birth and his le emphasise that God#s message was for the ordinary folk, those who were not important to the rich or the powerful, but who were important to God.As Jesus grew he made his home and his le with those the world rejected, with those the world despised because those were the ones who found special favour with God.Jesus came to bring God#s inclusive love to everyone and to love everyone in this wonderful kingdom.#Isn#t he just like his dad#.May God bless you at this very special time."},{"url":null,"title":"sleeping oot to awaken minds","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowIn a howling wind and spattering rain, a group of brave souls slept outside in a Lochgilphead alley to raise awareness of homelessness.Taking inspiration from the Edinburgh Wee Sleep Out and Glasgow Sleep in the Park, Gill Hutton of recovery cafe Grub#s Up organised her own #Big Sleep Oot#, to highlight the rise in homelessness.Armed with ious sleeping bags, burners, scarves and hats and cardboard boxes,  determined people braved Storm Deirdre to sleep on the street."},{"url":null,"title":"review of 2018 january to june","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTragedy and communityThe year began with sadness and shock at the tragic sinking of Tarbert fishing boat Nancy Glen TT on the evening of Thursday January .Skipper Duncan MacDougall and crewman Przemek Krawczyk were missing, while crewman John Miller was rescued before the Nancy Glen went down.Painstaking searches of land and sea followed, but no signs were found of the missing men.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion.

They also attend walking football.ldquoAllan picks Kay up and brings him home after the game which is a great help to me. I would recommend this service to anyone who is caring for someone with dementia.Another person benefitting from Alzheimer Scotlandrsquos befriending service is Mary who receives visits from volunteer befriender Heather Johnstone.Maryrsquos daughter said: ldquoFor many years my mother has not been able to leave the house unless taken out by me and had no-one to speak to other than me and my partner.ldquoShe is now living with us and has been partnered with her befriender Heather, who she says she has no dficulty in speaking to.ldquoShe looks forward to their conversations and going out for a coffee and a scone. This then leaves me to enjoy a bit of free time without having to worry about her.ldquoThis one to one arrangement works well for my mother, who is very deaf, rather than a group situation where she would not be able to participate.Anybody interested in becoming a befriender can email borders@alzscot.org or call   for more information.

the architects and builders of Abbotsford, and original installers of the Portcullis Gate December , .The Portcullis Gate, made of oak and wrought iron, was designed by Scott between  and , creating a grand entrance for visitors to his home.It remained an integral part of Scotts lsquoconundrum castle.But it had suffered many years of continuing deterioration, reaching the point where conservation was critical to avoid it falling apart.Keith, great-great-grandson of Thomas Smith, was delighted to keep the family connection with the gate and told the invited audience of Abbotsford donors and Friends about the link between theSmith family, Darnick and Abbotsford.Keith said: ldquoAbbotsford is a joy.\"My family and others from Darnick are proud to have played a part in its construction.\"The gates are a tribute to local craftsmen - ancient and modern.Initial plans by The Abbotsford Trust, to replace the old wood and repair the wrought ironwork on the gate, were revised when research by The Scottish Conservation Studio revealed the Portcullis Gate was not a mismatch of wood of ying quality as originally thought, but was in fact all original wood from Scottrsquos time.The project turned into one of conservation rather than replacement.Pippa Coles, Abbotsfordrsquos Gardens Heritage Development Manager, said: ldquoWe are thrilled to see the gate back in position and looking as Scott intended.\"Earlier this year, I read in John Smithrsquos diary that the gate had originally arrived on December , , so I felt it was a fitting date for their , and it was extra special that Keith, Johnrsquos descendant could join us.ldquoWe are very grateful to our funders and donors who made this important conservation project possible.\"We hope visitors to Abbotsford in the New Year, when we reopen in March, will enjoy walking through the grand entrance, just as Scottrsquos guests did nearly  years ago.The skilled restoration work was undertaken by Charles Taylor Woodwork, based in Dalkeith.The gates were removed last December, dried out and then dismantled and recorded before work began.The original wooden frame was badly damaged and has been replaced, while the internal lattice work has been restored by splicing in good wood from the old frame.Despite its name, the Portcullis Gate is hinged and not raised and dropped by a pulley system.It derives its name from its design, which references the style of a portcullis, an image of which is also carved above the gate.Scottrsquos use of this defensive symbol at the main entry to his home suggests that he viewed Abbotsford as a personal sanctuary.The portcullis image was also used by Scott on his personal book bindings in his library, where the symbol is accompanied by the Latin motto Clausus Tutus Ero , signalling Scottrsquos attitude to Abbotsford as a place of safety from the outside world.Due to its symbolic recurrence throughout Abbotsford, the Portcullis Gate is considered by many to be one of the homersquos most important features.It not only serves as an image of grandeur for guests arriving at Abbotsford, but also symbolises Scottrsquos intentions for Abbotsford as a place of retreat from the chaos of the outside world.The gate was so iconic that it was photographed by William Fox Talbot in October,  for his book The Sun Pictures of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"thea-and-thomas-are-the-most-popular-baby-names-in-the-borders","story":"BORDERS parents have gone against the grain when choosing baby names this year.The most popular choice for new-born girls in the region during the past  months is Thea -

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"community-rallies-to-support-the-family-of-amanda-cox","story":"A HUGE community effort to support the family of Amanda Cox will continue this evening.The

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty. Granted, it is a small liberty, but it must be treated with utmost care and consideration.ldquoWe need to have a real and considered debate before deciding on this.

I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

attending the infant school before transferring to the primary school for P to P.However, both schools operated their own curriculums independent of each other.A recent inspection by Education Scotland found a gap in the literacy and numeracy performance of children coming into P.The new school will follow a single curriculum anda single headteacher will be appointed to oversee its management.The decision to push ahead with the plans came despite a public consultation which found only  per cent of those who took part were in favour of the proposal, with  per cent against it.And it was revealed that while the parent council of the infant school was for the merger, the same body from the primary school had opposed it.Fiona Robertson, East Lothianrsquos head of education, said that following those results she had arranged to meet face to face with parents at public meetings in a bid to tackle their concerns.She said: ldquoIt is really important we work with the parental community and I took part in further meetings with parents because in their minds to say closure sounds like their school is going to be shut and there were concerns about operating over two sites.Mrs Robertson said that Helen Gillanders, headteacher of Dunbar Primary School, which operates over two sites, also attended meetings to discuss how her school operates.The merging of the two schools was supported by all four ward councillors at a meeting in Haddington.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader, said it was ldquothe most important decision we make\".He said: ldquoPupilsrsquo le chances are affected by their school experiences and both schools play a signicant role in this community.He acknowledged that there had been concerns from some parents but pointed to a recent inspection at Prestonpans Primary School which had called for additional support to be given to the school after grading its performance as weak in parts.He said: ldquoWe know we have and have had great teachers, inspiring headteachers and great support staff and yet we receive these reports.ldquoWe owe it to the children of Prestonpans to give them the best opportunities they can. I think in the long term it will be the best benefit for the people of Prestonpans.His view was given cross-party support at the council meeting, with fellow councillor Norman Hampshire saying that concerns about the merger were caused by ldquoa fear of the unknown.The new school is expected to be operational by February, with a Transition Action Group brought in to oversee any changes.Its name is still to be decided."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-tom-kitchins-new-pub-in-east-lothian-officially-opens","story":"Tom and his we Michaela have opened The Bonnie Badger, which was previously The Golf Inn.It has undergone a full refurbishment, with  bedrooms, a bar, a -cover dining room and an outdoor garden.The business officially opened todayon the villagersquos Main Street.ldquoMichaela and I have dreamt of having a pub with rooms for years, and wersquove always been particularly fond of the East Lothian area, having spent time here on weekends with the kids, said Tom.ldquoWhen this opportunity came up it just felt that it was meant to be.ldquoWe have always loved the feel of the old hotel and we want to ensure that we keep the heart of the building whilst enhancing the offering.ldquoIt will be a place to escape for a day trip, pop in for a drink after a game of golf or stay overnight for a weekend break to experience the incredible scenery that East Lothian has to offer."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-700-celebrations-build-on-great-work","story":"Councillor John McMillan praised the efforts of the Haddington  team.Events have been held throughout the year to mark  years since the town received the Bruce Charter ndash the oldest document in the East Lothian Archives.The final event saw a concert held by Siobhan Miller at St Maryrsquos Parish Church last Thursday evening.Mr McMillan said: ldquoFor the children, in the Year of Young People, we finished on the John Knox and Robert the Bruce Lego event.ldquoIt was amazing and a great tribute to Ruth Fyfe and Frances Woodrow, the archivists at the John Gray Centre, who had the initial idea and have been at the heart of it all.

The word Unionist is included in the full title of their party and the historic privileges enjoyed by them and the cultural constituency they represented have all indeed flourished when Westminsterrsquos writ has run in its four constituent parts.This is not to say that they are anything less than fully Scottish, just that they believe Scotlandrsquos destiny to be forever entwined with the UK. Itrsquos merely one among many declarations of what it means to be Scottish and none the less valid for that and is characterised chiefly by an historic affectionnot love for what they understand Britishness to be.Thus, there was an honesty and integrity about the Scottish Toriesrsquo opposition to independence that was absent in much of the campaigning of Scottish Labour chiefs and their water-carriers on social media. This seemed to be fuelled less by any great love for the Union than by an implacable malevolence ndash sometimes approaching outright hatred ndash towards anything sponsored by the SNP. At times you formed an impression thatScottish independence was being proposed by wee green men emerging from a spaceship they would receive a fairer hearing in some Labour circles than anyone sporting a yellow and black rosette.The seeds of such bitterness were probably sewn in hundreds of Westminster and electoral campaigns keenly contested and with a signicant degree of rancour with the SNP. On these occasions it wasnrsquot the Tories who were threatening their influence and privileges but the SNP, even though they may have shared largely similar social agendas. Many simply couldnrsquot stomach the possibility of permitting what would be the ultimate triumph of the SNP evenit meant ignoring what their instincts were telling them: that Westminster was beginning to favour options for the rich in its economic policies and to re-direct any resultant working-class bitterness in the direction of immigrants.Even the most reactionary of Tory governments come to power on the back of working class votes. For this to occur, they must always have an assortment of familiar phantoms and usual suspects to hand and these must be leveraged by calls to national unity and security or the echoes of empire. Any notions Scottish Labour might have entertained about de-coupling from such a polity were swamped by antagonism towards the wretched SNP. They also fashioned a  narrative to conceal such narrow animosity. Thus, the lie that the referendum was nasty and isive and that Yes supporters despised the English became the distinguishing feature of their campaign.It was probably this, as much as anything , that formed the tipping point for many Labour supporters who, having signalled their rejection of such a dishonest narrative, were subsequently marginalised and made to feel like aliens in their own party. None of them have since ed to the Labour fold and this, more than anything  is why Labour in Scotland is a spent force with no immediate prospect of recovery.Foolishly, Richard Leonard, Labourrsquos latest leader in Scotland, continues to oppose independence while exhibiting no shred of original thinking on policy that might make his party attractive once more to the tens of thousands of its former supporters who have abandoned it.As Westminster takes a two-week holiday while the clock ticks towards a No-deal Brexit nothing in the behaviour of Labourrsquos UK leadership has done anything to inspire confidence either. In the last seven days Irsquove asked several Labour supporters to describe their partyrsquos Brexit strategy. No two answers were the same and all were marked by confusion. Any empathy they had previously felt with Jeremy Corbynrsquos policies on social justice has evaporated, largely on the perception that he has been found grievously wanting on this the biggest political issue of their lives. No leadership, no consistency, no courage and no conviction are the unorm verdict of Mr Corbynrsquos lamentable last two weeks at Westminster. By contrast, Theresa May, even in these her darkest dayshas displayed all of these attributes.The spectre of a No-deal Brexit now looms large and with it the real threat, which the UK Government has now admitted, of civil disorder. These and the exposure of Mr Corbynrsquos failure of leadership will test the propaganda unit of the Better Together campaign during the second referendum on Scottish independence.Once, it might have been a valid argument to insist that in a time of national crisis we must pull in the same direction. Butyou have been ignored and treated with contempt as Scotlandrsquos Government and Scotlandrsquos parliament have been in their efforts to help get a decent Brexit or even to mitigate its worst effects then such appeals are rendered worthless and hollow.In  Westminsterrsquos lurch towards reactionary and socially isive policies tipped many of us towards an independent Scotland. Such a hard right agenda also seemed to act as an accelerant for darker elements with racist agendas. More than four years later the England that many of us loved and admired is on the verge of capitulating to these forces and it looks like UK Labour has been fighting them with a peashooter.When it comes time to have our second referendum ndash and we will have it ndash there will be a moral dimension to consider for those who previously voted No and this will outweigh everything .

This is what I said:ldquoItrsquos friendship and memory, wonderful moments and the emotions that go with them ndash the perfect partner to unforgettable events in all our lives.ldquoIt is the heady night my first daughter was born, when I arrived home from hospital and poured an Old Fettercairn to make a joyful, tearful toast to my we and tiny new baby.ldquoOr the bright May evening outside the Kingrsquos House in Glen Coe after my friend and I had climbed Agagrsquos Groove on the Buachaille Etive Mor. We shared a hip flask of Springbank as we stared up at the mountain, and it was the best Irsquod ever tasted.ldquoIt is the evenings around my kitchen table with my pal from across the road, music playing a little bit too loud into the wee small hours as the whisky and stories and laughter flow.ldquoThese moments, these images of times to treasure, that ability to create wonderful memories. That is, at the absolute basic, the essence of whisky.People often say that something is greater than the sum of its parts ndash well, that phrase could have been coined especially for Scotlandrsquos national drink.Since I first fell in love with whisky in , Irsquove been lucky enough to try some unforgettable drams ... including one or two whose price tag ran into five figures.But over the years itrsquos become clear to me that you donrsquot have to pay thousands ndash or even hundreds ndash to get your hands on something really special.If you know what yoursquore looking for you can find a spectacular dram on a supermarket shelf or in your local whisky shop, and you certainly wonrsquot need to spend as much as you think.Over the following four pages, Irsquove listed a few of my favourites ndash some of the most interesting and exciting whiskies around today. And nearly all of them cost less than pound.If you like what you read, go out and buy a bottle ndash I promise you that you wonrsquot be disappointed.Good luck!Ardnamurchan  ADABV : .%Price: poundLetrsquos start at the very beginning hellip with a dram so young wersquore not even allowed to call it whisky.Itrsquos generally accepted that the older whisky is, the better it gets, but Ardnamurchan  AD is definitely the exception that proves the rule. It boasts a depth of flavour that belies its youth ndash a heady mix of sweetness and citric sharpness, but with the richness of dried fruits and a satisfying biscuity creaminess. Far off there are hints of pepper and the odd waft of smoke. Yum!The  AD continues parent company Adelphirsquos pioneering use of blockchain to give unique levels of provenance to every bottle. By scanning the unique QR code on the back label, consumers can trace every ingredient and every stage of the ldquomanufacturing process, from field to bottle.And,yoursquore still not convinced, just look at the bottle. Simple and sleek, it won  Scottish Design Awards for packaging.So with just , bottles of this beauty ever made, itrsquos definitely worth a quick dash to grab one. It will probably be a collectorrsquos itemyou donrsquot open it. But having tasted it, that will be a really big ldquo!www.adelphidistilleryGlenkinchie -year-oldABV: %Price: poundIrsquoll never forget it.It was a pub in Dundee ndash I canrsquot remember the name but I do remember the location the Queenrsquos Hotel at the bottom of the Perth Road ndash and it was , I think.And I didnrsquot like whisky, until that amazing night when I tried Glenkinchie.My friend had bet me he could find me one that would change my mind. When he handed the Glenkinchie to me he said: ldquoLook for the ice cream.And when I drank it, it was there, coating my mouth and at the back of my tongue hellip and I was hooked!Nowadays, Irsquod say therersquos far more to this dram than hints of vanilla and a lemon cheesecake creaminess. In fact, I think that for a Lowland malt ndash itrsquos distilled just outside Edinburgh ndash it has a wonderful richness and depth, and it really stands scrutiny against the biggest guns of Speyside, and some of the great Highland malts.Add to that a lovely natural, almost herbal note and you have a dram that really is one to remember.www.maltsArran The Bothy Quarter Cask Batch ABV: .%Price: pound.They say the Isle of Arran is Scotland in Miniature. But, believe me, therersquos nothing miniatureabout this fantastic dram from a lovely distillery in the north of the island.It packs as impressive a punch as any expresssion Irsquove tried over the years.As you can guess from the name, this is the fourth release of the Quarter Cask. Each one so far has been an absolute winner, and this is no dferent.The idea is simple: take the usual Arran whisky and, for the last  months of its maturation, move it into smaller casks ndash yes, you guessed it, a quarter the size of the original and made of American Oak.This allows far greater contact between whisky and wood, resulting in a faster, more intense maturation.The result is an absolutetreat ndash rich and powerful with tonsof vanilla sweetness and peppery spice. Itrsquos fruity and fresh, but at the same time really luxurious.This is a real star in a brilliant range. The distillery is well worth a visit too ndash the scones are amazing!www.arranwhiskyKilchoman SanaigABV: %Price: poundSpeed bonnie boat like a bird on the wing, over the sea to Skye. We all know the song about Bonnie Prince Charlie but, seriously,yoursquore looking for a Young Pretender, yoursquod be far better jumping on the ferry to Islay.Kilchoman is the newest of the distilleries on this little patch of land thatrsquos jam-packed with wonderful whisky, but itrsquos already giving its globally recognised neighbours a run for their money.Following on from the Machir Bay, Kilchoman ups its game a little with the Sanaig.Itrsquos described as a peaty malt, but for me itrsquos got that beautul aroma of Arbroath Smokies ndash sharp wood-ember smokiness mixed with a wonderful creaminess thatrsquos simply irresistible.Add to that light fruit, dark chocolate and raisins, along with red-berry richness, and you could be on a picnic on a beach with your pals, chatting and laughing until the last of the embers of the fire die down.A real treat ndash and brilliant value.kilchomandistilleryBenromach -year-oldABV: %Price: pound.Sometimes whisky isnrsquot about posh tasting notes and fancy descriptions of complex aromas and flavours. Sometimes itrsquos about something thatrsquos far more simple.Sometimes, when you smell it, it transports you somewhere  ndash to a memory or a favourite place.For me, this -year-old Benromach does just that. It takes me back to when I was young, six or seven, maybe, to a time when we lived in an old house, with a big open fire, and we used to sit there of an evening ndash it would have been about this time of year ndash roasting marshmallows.I can smell the fire ndash not a roaring one, but mellow embers with the odd little puff of smoke. I can taste the rich toffee-sweetness of the melting marshmallows.But, therersquos something  too ndash is that Jamaica ginger cake  Not homemade, but the sticky one out of the packet. Itrsquos luxurious, and it makes me smile.So,you have a whisky and the tasting notes donrsquot make any sense to you, donrsquot worry. More powerful forces may be at work ndash just open your mind and see what you can see.www.benromachCaol Ila -year-oldABV: %Price: poundThis is another one ndash another malt that holds a special place in my heart.When my two daughters were young, this was the one I remember sitting back with as the madness of Christmas began to subside at the end of the day. And itrsquos still the one Irsquoll go forI see it on a menu after dinner at a hotel.Caol Ilais a Muhammad Ali of a dram hellip it dances around, all lightness and fruit itrsquos fascinating and mesmerising.But at some point or other, you just know itrsquos going to knock you out with a wonderful smack of smoke.It starts off light and refined, with fresh herbal notes and hints of damp grass, but then the coastal smokiness really kicks in ndash not unlike hot-smoked salmon. Itrsquos full-bodied and has a long, warming finish.As you add water, a wonderful freshness ndash much like Ardbeg ndash takes over, making this a hugely satisfying dram.www.maltsOld Particular Cameronbridge -year-oldABV: .%Price: poundWe couldnrsquot let a list of brilliant whiskies go without including a single-grain. And what better place to find one than at legendary Glasgow-based independent bottler Douglas Laing The Cameronbridge isnrsquot exactly blessed with the beautul surroundings of Strathisla or Glengoyne, or the rugged backdrop of Dalwhinnie ndash it sits in Fersquos industrial heartland, just a stonersquos throw from Methil and Leven.It may not have had the most romantic of beginnings, but this Cameronbridge is a real ndash and rare ndash treat.In my mind, the defining characteristic of single-grain whiskies is cream, and this expression is awash with it.In fact, when you smell it, therersquos almost an aroma oftoffee sauce ndash salted caramel mixed with all that cream, but with a bit of honey thrown in for good measure.You could almost pour it on your sponge pudding.Therersquos cakiness too ndash in fact, this is more like a big, rich sharing dessert than a dram.Now, wherersquos my spoon  I want another helping .www.douglaslaingcomOld Pulteney -year-oldABV: %Price: poundIf anyone ever says that whisky isnrsquot a product of its surroundings, this is definitely a dram to make them change their mind.Itrsquos made in Wick, and its warehouses are exposed to the full force of the North Sea.This gives the whisky a wonderful coastal, salty personality ndash and once you get to know it, you can recognise it anywhere.But donrsquot think this dram is harsh in any way at all. The -year-old is aged entirely in bourbon casks, and this gives the finished product a wonderful richness and sweetness ndash and the distinctive vanilla that is always there when bourbon casks are used.Look for vanilla, tablet and almost burnt sugar on the nose, with a flavour balancing chocolate and toffee indulgence with citrusy fruit and that coastal tang.This level of quality is great value at pound, but be aware that Old Pulteneyis regularly on offer ndash I think itrsquos pound in Tesco right now, and at that price itrsquos a steal.www.oldpulteneyKilkerran -year-oldABV: %Price: poundBefore we start, letrsquos take a moment to thank Kilkerran ndash because the distillery where itrsquos made, Glengyle, effectively saved Campbeltownrsquos status as a whisky region.After many years of only having two distilleries, Springbank and Glen Scotia, it was deemed that Campbeltown could no longer be classed as a region.However, when Glengyle was resurrected ndash it was an old distillery that closed in the s but was brought back to le in  ndash the three operational distilleries could maintain their status.And just as well, as Campbeltown malts are unique ndash robust, oily and bursting with character ndash and this Kilkerran -year-old is certainly a classic of its kind.Itrsquos oaky and slightly peaty, but super-rich, sweet and velvety smooth at the same time. And, of course, therersquos the oiliness and saltiness yoursquod expect from a Campbeltown dram.This whisky was only launched in , but it surely deserves its place among the true greats of this amazing region.All hail Kilkerran ndash you are indeed a hero!kilkerran.scotMacallan -year-old Double CaskABV: %Price: poundThe Macallan has been looking a million dollars lately hellip literally. One of its bottles ndash a -year-old distilled in  ndash broke that mad, seven-figure barrier just a few weeks ago, but far more importantlythe distillery moved house hellip to possibly the most beautully perfect building I have ever seen.So, as the year draws to a close, I was pretty sure my impression of this superbrand couldnrsquot get any more positive hellip until I tasted the Double Cask.Much of my whisky journey has been a hunt for the dferent and the new, but when I come back to a dram like The Macallan and its perfect richness, I remember therersquos a reason why this is a worldwide favourite.The Double Cask uses whisky aged in barrels of both American and European ex-sherry oak to take the spirit to a whole new level.Therersquos the classic dried fruit. Itrsquos creamy and you can almost see the drops of honey. But therersquos the sweet sharpness of marmalade and almost the spiced luxury of a cinnamon pastry.A finish of vanilla and more sweet fruit and I have only one challenge on my mind as we end .Go on Macallan, I dare you ndash top that next year.www.themacallanArdbeg An OaABV: .%Price: poundTo me, Ardbeg is about only one thing ndash itrsquos what identies it the minute I stick my nose in the glass.Smoke ndash pure, perfect, wood-embers smoke.And the An Oa ndash launched last year as the first addition to Ardbegrsquos core range for more than a decade ndash doesnrsquot disappoint.Itrsquos there in spades, mixed with a wonderful cocktail of cakey sweetness and butterscotch richness. Therersquos a luxurious creaminess in the background too, just in case you didnrsquot get just how special this dram really is.Then,you add water therersquos another treat in store ndash something I donrsquot understand from such a peaty whisky, but which I always look for in an Ardbeg.The peaty oomph remains, but something  appears ndash the most wonderful freshness. Itrsquos like a summer breeze blowing through freshly washed linen just hung out to dry on a line by the sea.If you like peaty whisky, you really canrsquot go wrong with Ardbeg, but this was the first time Irsquod tried the An Oa.Time to rewrite my whisky wish-list, I think!www.ardbegGordon  MacPhail Discovery Bunnahabhain -year-oldABV: %Price: poundThere are Islay whiskies ndash the ones that take a barrowload of peat and stuff it down your throat ndash and there are Islay whiskies ndash the ones that tone things down, some a teeny bit, some a lot. For me, Bunnahabhain sits in the second camp hellip and itrsquos all the better for it.So when Gordon  MacPhail ndash one of the countryrsquos small band of legendary independent bottlers ndash gets hold of an already interesting dram, itrsquos time to take notice.This Discovery expression ndash part of a wider range from around the country ndash is rich and exciting, with dried fruit and sherry on the nose, and hints of spice, rich vanilla and orange. Itrsquos super- smooth, and as you taste it the initial spice morphs into more richness of dates and plums. At the finish, therersquos chocolate ndash maybe not milky bar, but definitely not bitter dark ndash and more fruits.The bottlerrsquos art is a critical part of the whisky firmament ndash they hunt out interesting casks and, when they find them they bottle them. Soyou see a bottlerrsquos version of one of our favourites, go for it ndash you will definitely be in for a memorable voyage of Discovery.gordonandmacphailNaked GrouseABV: %Price: poundAs I said in the introduction to this whole article,yoursquore after something truly memorable, you really donrsquot have to spend a fortune to get it hellipyou know where to look. And at under pound in some shops, the Naked Grouse is in my mind a must-have for any collection.Pour it for your whisky-loving friend ndash but donrsquot show them the bottle ndash and watch as they muse over the malty, toffee-sweet nose and rich fudgy, fruity flavour, topped off with a little spice, and tryto identy what high-end dram it belongs to.Soyoursquore looking for a superb, great-value dram, just remember one thing ndash sometimes less really is more.nakedgrouseTomatin -year-oldABV: %Price: poundAs you head up the A, by the time to reach Tomatin you know yoursquore in the Highlands. The bleak splendour of Drumochter and Dalwhinnie are miles behind the Cairngorms and Aviemore are a rapidly fading memory. Inverness isnrsquot far off, and from there itrsquos on to the wild lands of Ross and Caithness.Yoursquod expect a whisky here to have ruggedness its heart ndash to be as unforgiving as a northern winter. But no, not a bit of it. The climate round here is softer and more gentle than you might imagine ndash and the spirit thatrsquos born from this land reflects that.The Tomatin -year-old is smooth and silky, with a rich, fruity aroma coming from its traditional mix of ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks. Itrsquos buttery at first, but there are also notes of marzipan. The flavours are powerful, but therersquos sweetness and richness, with oaky vanilla, ripe apples and pears. Hints of stem ginger and citrus add a tangy treat.Soyou ever thought the Highlands were bleak, think again. All you need to do is stop a while, look around you, and yoursquoll find a real gem hidden in the north.www.tomatinDouglas Laingrsquos Remarkable Regional MaltsABV: VariousPrice: From pound to poundI could choose one from this range, but really, therersquos no point. Quite simply,you try one you really should try them all, because theyrsquore as good a lesson in the dferent characteristics of Scotlandrsquos whisky regions as yoursquoll ever need.

This is definitely one to come back to on a cold, stormy night when I have some time on my hands, and the music player to myself.

The finish is all cream and vanilla with a touch of cinnamon-spice.For the whisky from the side of the A, itrsquos a definite A+ from me!www.tullibardine"},{"url":null,"title":"pm-and-party-leaders-pay-tribute-to-paddy-ashdown","story":"Sir Vince Cable and past Lib Dem leaders joined Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn and others including Tony Blair in hailing the dedication and decency of the politician and former commando, who passed away on Saturday evening.The former party leader, who was credited with making the Lib Dems a signicant third force in politics during his tenure between  and , had announced he was suffering from bladder cancer in November.The party announced his passing, saying he would be remembered ldquoas someone who made an immeasurable contribution to furthering the cause of liberalism.Sir Vince Cable, the partyrsquos current leader, said it was ldquoa hugely sad day for the party and everyone  across politics ldquowho had immense affection and respect for Paddy.He hailed a man who ldquowas famous for his politics, but his talents extended well beyond that arena.Born in India and raised in Northern Ireland, he later served in the Royal Marines and Special Boat Service, including in Borneo and the Persian Gulf.He hit the headlines four years into his leadership of the Lib Dems when, in , he revealed he had had a five-month affair with his secretary, which led The Sun to nickname him ldquoPaddy Pantsdown.His marriage to we Jane survived the scandal.After stepping down as leader, Ashdown, who was MP for Yeovil from  to , was first knighted and then made a peer as Lord Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon when he quit the Commons.He became High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina in May  and, more recently, went on to play a role in the Remain campaign during the  referendum, appearing alongside then-PM David Cameron and Lord Kinnock, the former Labour leader.After revealing his cancer diagnosis, he tweeted that it ldquodoes not merit a fuss, adding: ldquoMany go through this.

Parties are deeply ided as is the nation and this will not end come March .So is there a way out of the Brexit maze  Possibly. It is called parliamentary sovereignty the most important part of the UK constitution.It is through Westminster that laws are made and can be scrapped. And even though we now have a devolved system of government in Scotland, Wales, and, at times, Northern Ireland, the constitutional authority ultimately remains in SW.When on June   the UK voted to leave the EU, no one or very few people believed the country would leave the Brussels bloc on June .A process through Parliament had to be undertaken and a deal agreed by MPs.Through Article , the Government ndash via Parliament ndash set the time and date at pm on March . And, as we have recently seen, the European Court of Justice has ruled thatParliament wanted to, it could revoke the leaving date and keep Britain in the EU. But, of course, Theresa May and her colleagues have no intention of doing so.Butthe people accept that it is through Parliament that its will is enacted, then what happens when Parliament finds doing this is just impossible On December , the Prime Minister pulled the vote on her Brexit deal because she realised that it was going to be rejected, big time. So, she bought herself a bit of time to try to get the EU to tweak the agreement to give Parliament control over the Irish backstop.But, despite reports of high hopes that Brussels will at one minute to midnight blink, the general expectation is that Mrs Mayrsquos deal is looking for as big a rejection on January  as it would have done on December .So what happens  Parliamentary sovereignty kicks in.In normal times, the Government can control Parliament through its majority, or, as is the case at present, it does so with a little help from its friends. But when those friends do not agree and, as at present, a large chunk of her own party does not agree, what on earth does the PM do Resign and spark a general election  On the first point, it is obvious that no one can unite the Tories on Brexit so Mrs Mayrsquos departure would not solve the problem it could even exacerbate it. On the second, the last thing Conservative MPs want is another election they could lose it. Survival concentrates the mind.So, here goes. Faced with a humiliating defeat, the PM pulls the vote again or suffers the expected parliamentary rejection. Either way, she then says that it is now up to MPs to decide the way forward. As Liam Fox, the Trade Secretary, recently pointed out: ldquoIt wasnrsquot the Government that was given an instruction by the referendum, it was Parliament.Mrs May says that a process has to be undertaken to find out where the centre of gravity lies in Parliament for the way forward on Brexit. So options are put before MPs: the possibly tweaked UK-EU deal Norway-Plus and no-deal.Now, of course, there will be some who insist a Peoplersquos Vote must also be an option yet the PM is strongly opposed to this. However, remember, Parliament is now in control. MPs would put forward an amendment to the Governmentrsquos options motion to include another referendum.It seems certain MPs would vote to include the Peoplersquos Vote option. In the vote, Mrs Mayrsquos deal get per cent support, no-deal , Norway-Plus and a Peoplersquos Vote .Now that Parliament is in control, the way forward is clear: the issue has to go back to the people.This, of course, would throw up its own process problems. The next EU elections are on May . Another referendum would probably have to take place before then, so the UK does not have to take part in the Euro-poll.This would mean fast-tracking the process of drawing up, debating and voting on a referendum bill and getting the elections watchdog, the Electoral Commission, to raty the process.How many questions should be on the ballot paper will be key but it will be for Parliament to decide. Chances are, it will be one choice: the UK-EU deal already agreed and staying in the EU no-deal would be off the table because most MPs believe it should be.Another issue that would be key would be the franchise. Should  and -year-olds be eligible as they were in the  Scottish referendum but as they were not in the  EU referendum  Parliament would decide.Of course, holding another poll would have people insisting this undermines democracy. Almost three years ago, the country voted in the biggest display of democracy it has ever seen to leave the EU. And now here the Establishment is subverting the will of the people.But our democracy works through Parliament not around it. Parliament has to find a mechanism to realise the will of the people. If it cannot, then it has only one option to go back to them for further instructions. Anda general election is not agreed upon, then the only recourse is another referendum set out in the terms agreed by - MPs.One of the biggest arguments for leaving the EU was for Parliament to take back control throughout this suggested route to the exit, MPs would have been in control all the way through.And once the people vote on the new options, then it will again be up to Parliament to enact their will.One can only hope that, second time round, it can do so whatever the result is."},{"url":null,"title":"ambulance-service-paying-32k-a-day-in-overtime-amid-staff-shortages","story":"On average, the Scottish Ambulance Service paid pound, a day in overtime to all staff - including managers, support staff and technicians - to work extra hours in .For paramedics alone, overtime was worth pound.m - the highest in five years, and up pound, in the space of a year.

That would be outrageous and, as the Committee has heard, fundamentally undermine efforts to target support where it is most needed.“Orkney has the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty at present. Unless the Minister agrees to think again ahead of Stage  consideration of this bill, that situation is unlikely to change.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The company asked Ofgem to approve the project, under a condition that, by the end of , there would be MW of generation capacity on Orkney committed to use the link once it is built.However, Ofgem has made its approval subject to SSEN demonstrating that, by no later than December , at least MW of new generation on Orkney has either been awarded a Contract for Dferencein the government#s  CfD auction or has secured planning consent and finance to construct its project.Meeting this increased generation target could prove challenging. This summer saw planning applications two large-scale wind farms, which would have contributed to this generation total, refused by Orkney Islands Council#s planning committee, following signicant public opposition.SSEN has said it #strongly disagrees# with MW of new generation being required, saying their figure of MW is based on industry best practice, which has been used to assess similar transmission investments across GB. SSEN has also said it is unclear why Ofgem is proposing a dferent test for Orkney, which it says conflicts with Ofgem’s own guidance on these types of transmission investments.Ofgem also says it plans to reduce the cost to consumers of building the link by seeking to replicate the outcomes of competition by using the #Competition Proxy# model, where it will set the revenue that SSEN can earn from building and operating the Orkney link based on its experience in cutting the costs of connecting offshore wind farms to the grid by tendering the ownership of these links.SSEN has stated concerns that the Competition Proxy model has  still not been fully developed by Ofgem, rather than the well-established Strategic Wider Works model.Ofgem has said it will make a decision on the business case for the link in spring next year and will confirm whether it will use the Competition Proxy model at the same time.Speaking on Friday, following the publication of Ofgem#s Needs Case consultation publication, David Gardner, SSEN#s director of transmission, said the recognition that the connection is needed is #a crucial step forward#, adding: “Whilst there are still several obstacles to overcome, having got this far it is important we don’t miss this opportunity to unlock Orkney’s vast renewables potential.#We will therefore continue to work in close consultation with our generation customers and wider stakeholders to address the key points raised by Ofgem in its consultation.”Ofgem has separately published a consultation on SSEN’s #Alternative Approach for Orkney# policy proposal, designed to overcome the barriers to connection faced by SSEN’s generation customers on Orkney.Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur welcomed Ofgem#s consultation but said there is still work to do to ensure SSEN#s proposals meet the needs and reflect the concerns of the local community.Aside from a transmission subsea cable from Orkney to Caithness, SSEN#s transmission reinforcement project, which, in one form or another, would stretch around most of the Orkney mainland and some of the south isles, would consist of:More information on SSEN#s Orkney Transmission Reinforcement project can be found at company#s website, here.For more on this story, see next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The first £ payment will be made around the time a child starts nursery, to help with the costs of early learning and a further £ when they start school.Social security secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “I am delighted we will be delivering the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment earlier than originally planned, providing low income families with increased financial support. I am particularly pleased, that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister, and had no support from the UK Government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.“With the Early Learning and School Age Payments, this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide £, # £, more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit. That’s a substantial investment to ensure our under s get the best possible start in le and reflects this government’s emphasis on the early years.“Our focus on supporting people on low incomes, and the action we are taking stands in stark contrast to the UK Government, who last week was criticised by the UN Poverty Rapporteur for being in denial about the damage and misery that their welfare cuts were causing.”Connie is  and lives in Glasgow her baby is five months old.“I heard about the Pregnancy and Baby Payment through One Parent Families Scotland, who told me all about the grant and how to apply for it,” she said.“The payment will go toward clothes, nappies and shoes for my son, babies grow so quickly and he’s five months now.“This will make a real dference to me, it’s not a payment I was expecting. It will make le a bit easier, my income stays the same, but my outgoings are higher as this is my third child. My other children are four and five so the things I had for them I don’t have anymore, so I’m kinda starting again.“I got the baby box which is great, but you get size - month clothes in that, so the £ would be of benefit when he’s a wee bit bigger.” vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Their role is to represent their local area, promote activities and showcase the positive contributions young people make to their local community.Orkney’s Hope Laing was one of those who volunteered to be a young ambassador.

Incredibly, the pound target was smashed within days, hundreds of complete strangers inspired by his determination amongst the backers.Speaking to the Ross-shire Journal this week, he said: \"Since getting access to the best facilities and coaches, my performance has improved and Im getting personal bests. Cycling in front of a home crowd in London was just so much fun ndash the noise was ridiculous and I just didnt want to come off the track.\"He powered through the km four-lap race in m s, pipped by just a fraction of a second by the reigning world champion.Fin, who needs a leg brace to race, was quick to thank those who have shown faith in him, not least parents Dee and Drew who have backed his dream from the start and driven him thousands of miles around the country to compete. \"Without them, none of this would have happened,\" he said. \"They were able to come down to London to watch, which was very special.\"After being invited to talk to pupils at his former school, Fin said he shared his highs and lows and spoke of the importance of setting a target ndash even amidst setbacks such as his illness.A spokesman at Dingwall Academy said: \"Effort, resilience, embracing challenge, listening to feedback, never giving up and learning from failures were all great messages.\"His mum Dee, a childrens nurse, earlier told the Journal: \"We have no idea what the future holds.

This is a month noted for its joie de vivre, bonhomie and what the German language, with typical economy, calls Weinachteneinkäuferwartung . It is signicant, perhaps, that the English language has no specic noun for the state of mind that settles on many of us during this special month. This state is marked by a niggling desire to get away – anywhere – in order to escape the state of mind that appears to affecting others.For some, the first appearance of Christmas lights is the signal that things are about to go downhill. In Edinburgh, this happens now in September, immediately after the Edinburgh Festival. This is in accordance with the desire of our local tourism promoters – a couthie lot – to inflict festivals on the long-suffering inhabitants of this city  , as the expression has it, and, indeed,  . For this, many feel they should be awarded  . But that is another subject, and it is too depressing to talk about it in a month during which we are all so spontaneously cheerful. The Reverend I.M. Jolly we most certainly are not.However, one feature of December that is genuinely enjoyable is the Christmas letter that people like to send their friends and relatives round about now. These are wonderful things to receive, and who does not feel a certain disappointment when they open a Christmas card and find that it contains nothing but good wishes for Christmas and the New Year  There is no point in sending others such thin fare: of course they have such wishes for you, and it would be odd,not actually hurtful,they were not to harbour such thoughts. By contrast, finding a cyclostyled letter within is a bonus, and sets the heart racing with anticipation.: Alexander McCall Smith: Edinburgh Airport should charge people to sit downAn important thing to understand about these letters is that they give an opportunity to boast, usually about one’s offspring. Usually this involves exam results, which form, on average, about half the content of a Christmas letter. When it comes to Highers and A levels and such things, people have no shame in trumpeting them loudly in the seasonal letter. Indeed, I have heard that the SQA, which controls exam results, is seriously thinking of withholding their release until December each year in order to ensure their topicality for Christmas letters. This is a helpful suggestion, although it may complicate university admission, which of course is another very fitting topic for the Christmas letter.What you should do in this respect is mention exam results indirectly. Don’t say Jane got nine As in her exams this year. That is clearly boastful and in bad taste. Rather, you should write, “Janeis still a bit worried about her university admission. I have assured her that anyone who gets nineA grades in her Advanced Highers has no need to worry, but does she listen to me  You know how children are!” Other family achievements should not be forgotten, and should all be referred to in a good Christmas letter. Once again, insert the information indirectly, as in this example: “We all went to Rome this year and had a wonderful time. The Pope looks so much younger, you know, when you see him close up. I mean, really close up, in his private study.” That conveys, in a very tactful way, the message you wish to convey. Then you might add, “We were a bit nervous of course, as this is the first time that we have had a direct experience of the beatication of a close relative . But it was such a simple, rather moving ceremony and we had a lovely dinner afterwards in a modest trattoria ...”: Alexander McCall Smith: Time to wake up and smell Europa’s coffee If you received an OBE or similar award this year, do not mention it directly. The following form of words will suffice: “We couldn’t get away in July, as planned, as I had to go down to London– just for the morning – what a bind!” If you went to the Garden Party, then the only way of conveying that information is to say something like this: “My goodness, it was a battle getting into my morning suitin July. There I was enjoying my statutory cucumber sandwich under the gaze of Arthur’s Seat, thinking of the strict diet ahead!” No more than that is necessary.All heavy colds and injuries must be mentioned. The attachment of a small photograph of an X-ray plate is optional. That, believe it or not, really was in a Christmas letter we received a few years ago. The fracture was an interesting one.

What followed has been the stuff of dreams.Back in , as the debate over Scotland’s constitutional future became ever more fractious, I grew accustomed to receiving some fairly unpleasant messages and Tweets from keyboard warriors who saw my scepticism about the SNP’s proposal as a matter of considerable treachery. Often they’d want to know what I was being paid to espouse the views I didand, when they were referring to my trade, they’d be sure to put the word journalist inside inverted commas, lest anyone be in any doubt that the truth was I was nothing more than a shill.Every day, I’d block dozens of accounts – ,, at the last count – and get on with my “so-called” “journalism”. But when the owner of an account by the name of @ropoem popped up on my timeline to challenge something I’d written, he stood out. Unlike my usual correspondents from the Yes side of the tracks, he was polite and playful.And so I followed him back and enjoyed our little exchanges, which never ended in agreement but always passed in good humour. Occasionally, I’d wonder who this guy was we seemed, politics aside, to have a lot in common. I’d wonder, too, what he made of me. Before long, I was to find out exactly who he was and, it turns out, he thinks I’m not so bad.In , the owner of my local video rental place bought a job lot of ”singles that had previously been used in jukeboxes. There were boxes and boxes of the things, which he knocked out at p each or a quid for three. To a -year-old music fan of limited means, this was a treasure trove. Over a period of months, I bought dozens of s – among them such classics as Rip it Up by Orange Juice, Werewolves Of London by Warren Zevon and  Carat Love Affair by The Associates – that I cherish still. When the stock on display ran low, the shopkeeper would produce yet more boxes containing yet more gems and, thus, one Saturday afternoon I walked out of his place with three recent hit singles – Cath, I’m Falling, and Young At Heart – by The Bluebells. What a magnicent score.These records – I’m Falling, especially – have remained great favourites of mine throughout the ensuing decades. I know them intimately yet they retain the power to thrill me.So when a friend emailed me in  to say he’d noticed I seemed to be getting on pretty well online with Bobby Bluebell, I was surprised and delighted. This @ropoem bloke, it turned out, was the songwriting genius behind some of my favourite records.An invitation to watch The Bluebells play in Glasgow a few days after the independence referendum followed, and when Bobby dedicated Young At Heart to me from the stage, I was fully smitten.I can be awkward with new people but Bobby and I slipped into an easy friendship, opening up about times good and bad, and enthusing about the music we loved.Perhaps I was being a little cocky, \u2028but when my mate Kenny, a drummer, and I, a sort-of guitar player, began renting out a rehearsal room in Edinburgh to make a racket, I invited Bobby along,he wasn’t doing anything , mind, and it was okayhe couldn’t make it.Not only did he make it, but he gave generously, patiently listening to scraps of music I’d written, to half-realised rfs, and offering gentle and wise guidance. Usually, this would entail him suggesting the removal of unnecessary noodling and the focus on the essence of the song. I may have been a know-it-all newspaper columnist but I was a know-nothing novice songwriter and here was someone who’d written for some of the biggest names in popular music – he’s written for Brian Wilson, for heaven’s sake – acting as my mentor. Soon, I was in not one but two groups with Bobby. Last year, our group Best Picture released their first single, Isabelle, and last week our other band, Fat Cops, released their debut, Hands Up! Get Down!, a song written by Bobby, the band’s keyboard player Neil Murray, and me. It was named single of the week by BBC Radio Scotland’s Afternoon Show. Proud  You bet.For someone who bought his first single in  and still buys them, these have been truly magical moments. And underpinning these developments is a friendship that came out of the blue. Bobby and I still disagree about politics, of course, but the circumstances of our meeting act as a constant reminder in these horribly turbulent times that political disagreement needn’t be a barrier to an enduring human connection.On  March, , Fat Cops’ debut LP will be released. We’re proud of it. It’s better than any of us – Bobby, Neil, Chris, Bass Chris, Al and I – imagined it might be and we’re looking forward to playing gigs to promote it. But the music we’re making is only part of the story. Yes, I’m now realising an ambition I’ve harboured for four decades, but I am only able to do that because of this most surprising friendship.And when it comes down to it, friendship is what really matters, isn’t it  We might live in troubling times with political leaders who want to ide us and extremists who want to help them in that objective but,we’re lucky enough to have them, our friends will sustain us through the darkest days.When @ropoem popped up on my Twitter timeline to tease me about my columns, I could – touchy as I can be – have taken the huff and told him where to go.Instead, I found a dear friend who has had the most profound and positive impact on my le.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4848338.1545655522!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch brexit hasn t covered union with glory could independent scotland do better","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The pantomime played out at Westminster has destroyed the global image of UK politics, writes Lesley Riddoch.What is there to look forward to in  One sunny upside of the final Brexit moment should be the disappearance of thoroughly discredited politicians like Jacob “Irish investment fund” Rees Mogg, Boris “f*** business” Johnson, Priti “starve the Irish” Patel, Dominic “I didn’t understand the full extent of cross-channel trade” Raab, Ruth “I will resign” Davidson and Andrew “Irish passport” Bridgen.: SNP call for Home Office to end ‘hostile immigration’ crackdownOf course, one voter’s shameless opportunist is another’s canny operator and in the slippery world of British politics it takes more than involvement in crashing the economy, putting the army on alert, depriving patients of le-saving medicines and stockpiling food to trigger the receipt of one’s jotters. The reputation of inidual politicians may survive Brexit, but one reputation will not – that of the so-called “Mother of Parliaments.” Throughout , the weakness, elitism, confrontational nature and ad hoc approach to constitutional change embedded in the Westminster system has helped precipitate the Brexit crisis and then allowed the UK government to grab, abuse and centralise power as it sees fit.: Lesley Riddoch: Passing on skills can be the best gtNone of your foreign checks and balances here, matey. The British system is special, and absolutely revered abroad.Well, Brexit has changed all that, judging from some telling BBC interviews with members of the London-based foreign press last week.: Nicola Sturgeon and Scotland’s political leaders release Christmas messagesAccording to Stephen Castle of the New York Times “There was an assumption that Britain as a smart sophisticated country would navigate its way through Brexit.” Evidently - it hasn’t. “When Italians look at Brexit debates in parliament they don’t find it particularly scary or crazy.” That comment by Enrico Franceshini of La Repubblica should be scary in itself. Italy is a working model of chaos with  changes of government in the last  years. Meanwhile, Stephanie Bolzen of Die Welt observes “Many Germans watch PMQs and they find it fantastic how people are shouting at one another in such an educated, sophisticated way. That’s why there is bemusement and even irritation at the fact this very parliament is suddenly falling apart.” Irritation – because Britain was believed to be the “special one,” and educated, sophisticated people across the world fell for that smooth, suave, Etonian lie. But the tenacious trio of Juncker, Merkel and Macron have drawn back the Brexit curtain like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, revealing a tiny coterie of inept, confused politicians trying to run the country in lofty, splendid isolation. The secret is out.Once upon a time, in the eyes of admiring foreign journalists and academics, the “Mother of Parliaments” provided the certainty, leadership, command and political focus often missing in the coalition, consensus-based modern democracies of mainland Europe. Now that illusion of control has gone – leaving nothing to characterise British political le save archaic rules, comedy dress codes, pantomime-like theatricality and an ever-widening democratic deficit between governing and governed which probably prompted the Brexit vote in the first place.Take Norway.Øivind Bratberg, a senior lecturer at Oslo University, runs the British Politics Society and edits a regular online journal analysing developments here.Interviewed for the Nation Norway film this summer, he explained that British politics offers the chance to observe behaviour mostly consigned to the history books everywhere . It’s grimly fascinating to the citizens of modern democracies to watch one person wield so much power “When something goes wrong in Britain you know who will be up against the wall.” Such a concentration of poweris less common in modern democracies where PR is the norm , decision-making is shared and consensus must be built before big decisions are taken. The Norwegian system produces relatively stable outcomes as a result of patience, politeness and long discussion. Over here, “stable” isn’t just one half of the emptiest phrase in politics. It has come to mean stagnation. A quarter of Westminster seats have been held by the same political party since the Second World War because in our first past the post system, the winner takes all and the devil takes the hindmost. The two main political parties still think that’s fair. Elsewhere, the kind of faultlines currently paralysing Labour and the Tories, would have created new political parties with clear purpose and a vestige of integrity. Instead, Britain is stuck with another outdated travesty of democracy – the world’s second largest unelected chamber. As the late Paddy Ashdown said twenty years ago “There can be no place in a st-century parliament for people with th-century titles upholding th-century prejudices.” Yet a few years later the outspoken former Lib Dem leader became Baron Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon – so powerful is the habit of preferment and so short-lived the hope of change. Now, Brexit reveals a Britain without respect for international law, as evidenced by widespread Tory contempt for the Irish backstop, contempt for the ECJ ruling that MPs can unilaterally cancel Brexit and contempt for the very idea the UK must pay its “dues” before crashing out of the EU. In Italy’s La Stampa, Michele Valensise likens Brexit to a poker game, and warns readers that, with all the drama in London, “it is easy to forget about the other contracting party, the  EU countries, whose patience has limits.” But living in a Punch and Judy political culture where the media holds coats instead of holding politicians to account, it’s no wonder the Brits underestimate Eurocrats – men and women who don’t scream, grandstand, flounce or threaten. They don’t make headlines, just progress. The majority are born negotiators and conciliators largely because of proportionality in their systems, just as British politicians are born confrontationalists because of first past the post and all that entails. Former Tory policy advisor and CEO of Brexit Analytics, Garvan Walshe wrote last week “The desire to seize positions of power and hold them against equally matched enemies is more associated with countries on the descent toward civil war than mature liberal democracies like the United Kingdom.” Well, quite. In his opinion the most probable outcome for “a country with few formal institutions and weak legal oversight of the political process” is simple. “English political chaos will stimulate Scotland to choose independence.”Brexit has hardly covered the Union with glory. Can Scotland do better as a modern independent state within the EU  In , we must have the chance to choose.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4847921.1545666765!/image/image.jpg","title":"over 300 kaiam staff lose their jobs on christmas eve","story":"Hundreds of employees at the troubled Kaiam plant in Livingston have lost their jobs the day before Christmas.Around  workers who manufacture optical receivers, were convened on Monday by joint administrators Blair Nimmo and Alistair McAlinden of KPMG.: Kaiam boss dances at Xmas party before jetting off to US as firm failsThey were told that due to declining work levels, high costs of operation at the site and the absence of customers orders, there was “no option” but to make  of the  employees redundant with immediate effect.: Kaiam workers burst into tears when told on Christmas Eve they will lose jobsThe remaining  employees have been retained to help the joint administrators explore a sale of the business.: Kaiam boss accused of “unspeakable cowardice” as Livingston workers not paid Christmas wageThe Scottish Government’s Partnership Action for Continuing Employmentprogramme, which responds to redundancy situations, has been mobilised.It ensures that local public sector agencies respond to potential and proposed redundancies as quickly and effectively as possible.Mr Nimmo said: “We fully recognise that redundancies at this time of year are particularly dficult.“Our main focus during this challenging period is to work with all affected employees alongside Scottish Enterprise, Skills Development Scotland and West Lothian Council to ensure that the full range of support is available to them.“We are also liaising with the UK Government in relation to the timing of redundancy payments via the Insolvency Service.“In the short term, we are exploring all available options for a sale of the business and would encourage any interested parties to contact us as soon as possible.”A crowdfunder for the staff of Kaiam has been set up to support employees.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"viking seeks update to install larger turbines ","story":"Viking Energy is applying to the Scottish government to increase the size of the turbines it has planned for the major windfarm development.Viking is seeking a iation to the current planning consent for an increase in maximum tip height of up to  metres, from m to m with a corresponding increase in the turbine hub height from  to m.The organisation says the change is intended to ensure the -turbine wind farm keeps up with the latest turbine technology, which, it says, has #advanced considerably# since the project launched more than  years ago.In order to keep up with the latest turbine technology , I propose they hold back for at least another  years, by which time I for one will be past caring#Despite the representation showing such a small increase in the height of the turbines, they will be almost an extra  feet which will give them an overall height of  feet. Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David. Your warning shots make me feel that I should grabfew bottles of whisky 🥃 go back to bed and snooze my way through the day even though there’s a hot Indian summer outside.!!Seriously , weare facing a dire situation which will impact on my grandsons far more than on me —— or you. When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔. Cheers.Is there going to be a remake of #Dad#s Army#  Only, a number of contributors seem to be vying for the part of Private Fraser: #Wur do-oO-MM-ED!# LOL 🙂# You stupid Boy, Pike##.sorry, John # lolI take your points Haydn and Ian, but according to predicted human population expansion, it is estimated the global population will be around  billion by the year  Other dynamics affecting population growth, as you know, is requiring more land not only for agriculture but for accommodation and expanded space for for other amenities related.Not doubt, I think, there may come a critical point where demand for the expansion of the population, not including technological advancement, will determine how we live and finding a balance between our own demands to this of the natural world and other le The driving force for this expansion is predominantly based on economics and technological advances, and as long as this is the precedent, this could bring into conflict what we want and what nature will will allow In the food chain, I suspect we will become more use to # processed food # as technological progress will find better ways of growing alternative foods, whether biologically or chemically, as an answer to keep a balance between our demands and this of a coexisting relationship with the natural laws which govern le itself, including humans.You are quite right John, there are people who seem to be dominating these columns and I fear that I am a guilty one —— as well as the others.Perhaps I should take a break and ease off.The trouble is, there are interesting and important problems out there which should be aired rather than be allowed to fester.Maybe a bit more humour would help to make the rough stuff a little more palatable.So, step forward anyone of a Dad’s Army disposition !! How about you John  Sadly my sense of humour is a little lacking here! £ million plus SCT funds gone.  meter high windmills on s of tons of concrete bases all over Shetland. All of this for what  The delusional idea that such a project will save the planet. VE is and always has been a money making project under the guise of the #Green Idyle#. The advocates being the usual shetland suspects, utterly unqualied in scientic justication and reason, highly qualied in political posturing and self-interest. No, there is nothing here of humour. I do believe we are rapidly destroying our planet bitthe findings of# The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change# are valid, windmills on Shetland are an irrelevancy, which will only increase our problems. Their construction will release vast quantities of CO their verywill warm the air around them. It goes a bit beyond Dad,s Army humour, about as funny as Donald Trump#s program of clean coal, Scotland importing fracked gas from the USA and Shetland shipping in wood for burning by deforesting Canada and Eastern Europe!!! It is long past a laughing matter. It is just Green idiocy at its most typical.Ian,I assume you mean “s of tonnes of concrete” per turbine base  Given that a single, typical .MW turbine needs over a thousand tonnes of steel-reinforced concrete , then VE turbines, whose blades will sweep  times the area , at . times the height, must surely need bases several times bigger than that # perhaps, - tonnes, each The accompanying destruction of the land these machines are sited on is also alarming # here is a quote from the link, again, for the small, .MW machine: Given the limited cerebral ability of most politicians this obviously did not prove too dficult LOL!Humour is a coping mechanism.If you can laugh 😆 in the face of adversity you become bullet proof. Only the brave and stoical can achieve that. Dwelling on negatives perpetuates negativity. Goodness knows, there are ample supplies of that in these columns.£ million plus SCT funds have not “gone” Ian. Money does not simply disappear. Whatever the total sum, a decent chunk will of course have found its way into the pay packet pockets of some of those with most to gain from the project. However, so long as the cash gets into the hands of the worthist members of the local community, deserving entrepreneurs intent on bettering their community, who could possibly disagree  Try to be more charitable Ian.If there was anything whfy about all this Tavish Scott would have long since ensured it was properly addressed. Just look how fearlessly he locked horns with the powerful vested interests south who were forever conspiring to keep Shetland in its box. Tavish has already clearly stated he is in favour of democratic reform of SCT, just notit requires him to stand up against anyone local.You`re right there Peter, the money hasn`t just gone it`s been squandered!Squandered or plundered John  Aren’t the controls on the access to Shetland’s charitable funds so weak that any dedicated self serving group with a plausible plan could arrange over time to help themselves  Viking by name#We’ve got to get away from the notion that the funds exist to secure Shetland’s economic future. They exist to ameliorate social disruption resulting from the oil era. Vast infrastructure projects in remote rural communities bring almost random redistributions in wealth and opportunity, drug dependency and a iety of other associated complex social issues and harms. Where is Shetland’s voluntary sector represented on SCT  It ain’t, and it runs scared of complaining.These unguarded funds have weakened and distracted local politics in Shetland. No one group is sufficiently powerful to say enough is enough. Where is the voice of those at the margins  Who speaks up for those in greatest need  The oil industry has washed it’s hands long since. The ongoing tolerance of this is pathetic.I note with entirely no surprise the MOD is now objecting to Viking Energy turbines due to their inherent jamming and degradation of air defence radars and electronic warfare aircraft and missile trackers recently installed at Saxa. Surely the writing must now be on the wall for this turgid project. Is it not well overdue that the SIC and SCT cut their losses and abandon this expensive nonsense  Perhaps the dark cloud of Russian and Putin#s recent belligerence has a silver lining for Shetland  How very ironic..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European. Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England. A separation you are keen to expand upon. I have to say you do seem confusedSo your British now,not a Shetlander, # accepting the majority wanting to be part of the E.U, So much for Wir Shetlandits Wir Westminster then!Give us a vote and I will vote with my head and my heart for Shetland to be clear of da lot a dem, EU, UK and Scotland all running massive deficits. We wid certainly be much better aff.Fake news strikes again then I guess#Which is this culture that demands you submit without question Ali   Sounds like it owes more to Henry Tudor than Kant and Rousseau. And what culture is it you are being asked to accept that separates us and is abhorrent to you   Eurovision   Persian   Mesophilic Perhaps you can expand on what your gripe actually is Ali,it isn’t pulling sovereignty with folk little dferent from ourselves.FYI should Brexiteers triumph I’d still rather separate Scotland from England and stay European as I don’t much want to be led by English nationalist bigots. No confusion there.As I said only a fool submits without question, and remaining in the eu is submitting without question.Go read the Lisbon treatyyou think it isn#t.I am intrigued as to what other opinions there is on Brexit, and whether or not this has a political agenda to suit the purpose for a particular party to benefit Is Brexit for the greater good of the few, but at the cost to the many Would Shetland be better off under Brexit   There does not appear to be a definite picture being drawn where people can make a concise and definitive choice. Even the politics which has caused this mess, seem to be at odds with each other  How do they expect the people of the countryto choose   The more you look into Brexit, the more I am convinced we would be better off on our own Maybe we should re-establish our links back to Denmark     Propaganda rules okPutting the culture issue Ali ducks aside I don’t get why pulling sovereignty when it is helpful is a problem, be that in the EU or even when accepting WTO rules which, guess what, weren’t written singlehandedly by her majesty’s government. Lisbon moved us to majority rule in a partnership of friendly nations. So what Perhaps the problem to following mutually beneficial accept-some-trade-off rules set by the collective group is where you fear your culture dfers, so again I am wondering what part of European culture Ali fears and   or rejects. Eating snails asideI’ve always felt the UK is an appreciated part of mainstream European culture. There is a joint love of family, films, bevvy and football, eating out a bitpossible, a law abiding appreciation of the need for democracy, free speech, free press etc. Fondness of folktales and music, poetry, song, literature, dance and even opera unite people across national boundaries. Again, what is Ali’s problem Leaving the EU will be bad for jobs, farming and the NHS and we don’t know what the deals will bring to fishing or trade. Vive la dference and long live the similarities. I think your own bigotry is shinning through Peter, You talk about pooling sovereignty on one hand while labeling the English bigots. You say one thing while meaning another will you be standing for office soon A few thoughts, not for the first time have we, in Britain, find ourselves alone with Europe united against us and the will of our people. Not for the first time in our history has our position looked bleak with hard times being promised to come. We are being bullied by a cabal of bureaucratic nonentities answerable to no one who would try and isolate and distance us from our Commonwealth friends. Our Sovereignty and independence being undermined and the will of our people being ignored and denigrated. Contrary to some misinformed views, I and many like me, welcome selective immigration from Europe but not at the expense of our Commonwealth friends, whatever their colour and Creed. I welcome open Borders in Ireland just as they were long before the EU ever existed.We have stood alone before and always overcome adversity however grave. IfJunker and the cabal running the EU will not negotiate and remain intransigent, sneering and neo-bellicose It is time to stand tall and give them the two-finger salute, not just the Churchilian one.Heavens Ian, I wis imagining a violin accompaniment.We cant feed our bairns sovereignty Ian, even the Bank of England agrees that we are going to be worse off.A self-made economic disaster.Let them eat cake.Really Ian, “bullied”   Surely Theresa May said her deal was a “good deal”.There is such a thing as reading too manyeditorials. Last one I read saw Ian’s “bureaucratic nonentities” blasted for removing the right of the honest Brit to buy a lawnmower so loud it could deafen you. How very dare the EU protect UK consumers Does Ian imagine Claude Junker doesn’t speak for the elected leaders of the remaining EU nation states, but that rather they march to his tune  Lamentable.The remain member states are naturally protecting the interests of their citizens, including those of the Republic of Ireland, who are in the worlds largest trading block, which is conveniently on our doorstep.The Commonwealth ties however are lose, with distant nations who urged Britain to Remain. The EU block will secure better trade deals with those nations faster by dint of size and relevance.British diplomacy has never succeeded by cutting off our nose to spite our face.Perhaps we should learn from the Nordic foreign minister who quipped last week that there are two types of countries in Europe: small ones and small ones that don’t realise they are small.Has the question really been answered as to why the Tories, gave us this referendum to leave the EU in the first place,it was not going to be in their favour, despite the fact much of our business is with the EU What hidden agenda do the Tories have that they are not telling us###..until it is too late Have we all become xenophobic and argumentive about the pro#s and con#s of the EU, and the need to # fly the flag # as a weak demonstration of nationalityor Britishness, said very, very loosely   It seems very much we are playing right into the hands of the Tories, and singing their song to their beat.What has brought this on other than a narrow vision and not looking at the bigger picture    Brexit only means one thing, and this one thing is for the Tories to benefit for themselves no matter how you look at it.I would prefer to be as part of the EU, instead of being outside it, looking in.It is as simple as that.Of come off it Ali! I have never once labelled all English people as being bigots, nor would I. English nationalist bigots are bigots by definition of being bigots. It’s a bit like a numpty being a numptythat helps.Great attempt at ersion Ali, but just what, or should it be which, is your “abhorrent” cultural problem exactly  It can’t be this hard to specy the culture s you abhore surely, be they mainland, Scottish, UK mainland, continental or from further afield No man is an island Ali, unless perhaps you moved a little northwards and changed your name to Forvik, but you might need to borrow a little cash from somewhere at that stage to build a hospital lest you ever get poorly. Heaven knows who would staff it though, when you are happy to say some cultures are abhorrent to you but won’t specy which.Last I checked you can’t train as a doctor at Shetland College, the NAFC or in a night class in Hamnavoe or Walls, so I guess we will be needing other folk from other parts and other cultures for some time to come. Maybe try to get over it Mr. Shetland-wid-be-much-better-aff-clear-of-da-lot-of-dem, EU-UK-and-Scotland.I do not know exactly what it is Peter, but your first paragraph reminds me of ##.. Is not worth noticing. lolHo ho ho! Glad you are laughing David 🙂I’m with you on the real agenda behind Brexit not being immediately obvious btw.I think the big picture is that there are some rich and powerful people in the UK wanting to shackle the UK to USA workers rights and health care in order to benefit from lower taxes after Brexit.They don’t need the EU to guarantee their human rights. They have holidays aplenty and investments in so many places that using the NHS is as alien to them as using public transport.They have uncharitably driven their agenda to the fore against the better instincts of one nation Tories and have done so using decades of media manipulation and dispicable xenophobic dog whistle messages on immigration.Thankfully as I write the Shaddow Home Secretary is advocating for an “efficient, fair and non-discriminatory migration policy” that is conducive to the UK’s economic interests. Something to wish for in the New Year.I take your points, Peter. It will be interesting how the Tories will drive their immigration policies and whether or not it bends more towards the USA than to this of the EU, after March next year One of the largest industries which depend on EU workers is in the hospitality industry, even here in Shetland there is a large EU workforce, not only in the hospitality industry, but the fishing processing industry as well.It will be interesting how the Shetland economy will cope after March .As for human rights, I question the validity of as to what will be used and what will be discarded in terms of either British or European Human Rights. I fear workers rights may be diminished and favoured more towards the employer than the employee     We shall see If the UK becomes # the cheap workforce of Europe # this may stir up resentment within the working ethos or political change##.before it is too late    We are in unchartered waters, and there could be stormy sea#s ahead. I just hope the changes are for the better of the collective rather than for the few    #I think the big picture is that there are some rich and powerful people in the UK wanting to shackle the UK to USA workers rights and health care in order to benefit from lower taxes after Brexit.# O dear dear me, it is all a wicked capitalist conspiracy.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh. Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England.

He worked as a barge loader on the Strabane-Derry Canal and he was known as a quiet man with an abiding interest in the history and folklore of his area.Jimmy Joe Reynolds was from Leitrim. He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford. After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1307567.jpg--.jpg?1544691749000\n","title":"ballykeel youth centre now open after refurbishment","story":"Ballykeel Youth Centre re-opened last week after a major refurbishment.The youth centre, which has been serving the Ballykeel community for  years had many of its areas rejuvenated.

It is this trip that has him in the full glare of publicity once again due to the Spotlight investigation. Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role. He said: “No. Nothing at all. I mean that was a genuine mistake on my part, I made a mistake and I apologised for it and I was punished for it.The matter will now be referred back to the Parliamentary Standards Commission, where the allegations will be further scrutinised.

My sacrice and dedication went to motorcycling and I’m very proud to be a Doctor of Letters because of that.“It’s a lelong sacrice. Since I was six-years-old I’ve travelled theand breadth of the UK racing. The injuries I’ve faced, the ups and downs, to actually win a world championship on top of all that is massive.“It’s nice that my family can see there was an endgame after all their sacrice in the beginning.Jonathan Rea shows off his new threads“It’s a very proud day for the whole family. Especially my two little boys , they realise that it’s not normal to be at an event like this. They know the ious race tracks inside out but this is dferent. I hope I can be a good role model for them.”The -year-old said it was the first time he had ever attended a graduation, adding: “I never imagined the first one would be my own.”Asked about his graduate attire for the ceremony, he said: “Of course I feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it’s really nice to be acknowledged outside the sport. It’s something that’s happening more and more recently.”The honorary degree follows the  award of an MBE on the New Year’s Honours list. Rea also finished runner up in the  BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

Jonathan Reas specially made suit for the ceremony“My grades at GCSE were A*s, As and Bs, but unfortunately I didn’t further that. I went travelling the world racing bikes.“After I left school I went to technical college and got an HNC in manufacturing engineering and then went on to work as an engineer.“It was hard to hold down a job as I was taking too much time off work to go racing.“I had what was nearly a career-ending injury. That was a dark time in my le because I didn’t know what was coming, I’d no great qualications behind me, I was working a minimum wage job. I wasn’t in a great state of mind.“I threw myself at bikes for a few years and then it worked out, my big break came.”He added: “Northern Ireland fans are very important to me. The travelling support has been immense these last few years. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.“On my sighting laps and slow down laps I can see the Northern Ireland fans. I always try to throw out a leg to acknowledge I’ve seen them.”Rea is often claimed by both Larne and Ballyclare and sometimes referred to as a son of Ballymena. Asked where he came from, he said: “I’m a country boy. I grew up in Kilwaughter, then moved to Ballyboley. We were part of Larne Council with a Ballymena area code and a Ballyclare postcode.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

He told the crowd of about  who had gathered that the move to invite him was a progressive one. “You invitation to me, a Protestant minister, is forward-looking and timely.” He said only around five per cent of the messages he had received in the run-up to his address at the Ard Fheis were negative.”But the minister came in for criticism from DUP MLA Gregory Campbell, who said his appearance and words at the meeting were “an insult” to victims of IRA bombings and shootings.Speaking before introducing Mr Latimer, Martin McGuinness said the two are good friends. “Over the years I’ve made many friends in the Protestant churches.” he told the crowd. “David is my friend.

In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37640118.ece/906b8/AUTOCROP/w300square/4046592-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"christmas day babies","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

More than , events took place across the country.“We’re such a lucky country to have such a diaspora who connect to Ireland.  million people..it’s about recognising what we have and looking at how we can keep that motivation going.”The first Global Irish festivals were held in October in Limerick and Donegal to help drive tourism in the off-peak season.They were funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs to the tune of , euro.Next year, funding will be provided to festivals in four counties.“They will be a dferent flavour in every county,” she said.Failte Ireland Corporate Portrait.Orla Carroll.Photo Chris Bellew  Fennell Photography It is part of a drive by Failte Ireland’s to boost the numbers attending festivals across the country over the coming years.In , more than , overseas visitors attended festivals in Ireland generating € million to the economy.“I would estimate that’s probably , in  although we haven’t got those figures yet,” she said.By , Failte Ireland wants to grow that figure to , visitors.If they manage it, it would be worth  million euro to the economy.Colourful perfomers pass O’Connell Street in the St. Patrick’s Festival parade“What people love about festivals, is you meet like minded people,” Ms Carroll said.“People are there for a similar reason to you. That is really motivating to travel for.”She said they are a great means of not only extending the summer trading season but of spreading tourism benefits across the country.Although the St Patrick’s Festival in Dublin draws the largest number of overseas festival goers, Ms Carroll said new research by the tourism body showed the majority of overseas visitors attending festivals did so outside the capital.“When Irish people think Electric Picnic, international visitors don’t come for that,” she said.“What they do travel for is the celebration of a specic interest, tradition or culture.”Galway Arts Festival, Tradfest, Rose of Tralee, Listowel Writers Week, Galway Oyster and Seafood Festival, Cork Jazz Festival and Dingle Food Festival are among some of the most popular.Next autumn, a new Halloween festival is being launched.Ms Carroll said even though people had started dressing up for Halloween in locations across the world, its origins lay in Irish Celtic traditions of Samhain, which comes from the old Irish for “summer’s end”.She said Failte Ireland wants to harness that in a festival next autumn. It will be in addition to the Bram Stoker festival, which is held in Dublin every October Bank Holiday weekend.The Macnas parade on Henry Street, closing the Bram Stoker Fersitval, a Dublin City Council and Failte Ireland event.

Come, all of you who are seeking the face of God. Here He is, the Child lying in the manger.— Pope FrancisDecember , Without fraternity, the pope said “even our best plans and projects risk being soulless and empty”.He added that “our dferences, then, are not a detriment or a danger they are a source of richness”.Francis made his appeal as trends toward nationalism, fuelling suspicion of migrants and refugees, have gained traction in much of the developed world.Francis urged the international community to “work decisively for a political solution that can put aside isions and partisan interests, so that the Syrian people, especially all those who were forced to leave their own lands and seek refuge where, canto live in peace in their own country”.He said he hoped an internationally-brokered truce for Yemen would bring relief to that country’s people, especially children “exhausted by war and famine”.Other Christmas wishes expressed by the pope included one for dialogue among Israelis and Palestinians so they can “undertake a journey of peace that can put an end to a conflict that for over  years has rent the land chosen by the Lord to show his face of love”.He also cited conflicts and vulnerable populations in much of Africa, in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Ukraine. He expressed hope that the “bonds of fraternity uniting the Korean peninsula” would be consolidated.On Monday, Francis celebrated Christmas Eve Mass for the faithful in St Peter’s Basilica."},{"url":null,"title":"roseanne barr to address israeli parliament","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

early Christmas present for the nurses who helped to save their lives.Saorlaith and Saoirse McLaughlin spent the first few weeks of their lives at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit .The girls were born six weeks prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication called \"Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome,\" where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.Their parents, Bob and Michelle, have since raised a staggering £, for the unit, with the help of their friends and work colleagues.This year alone, they raised over £, through a tattoo fun day and a sponsored walk.But the McLaughlin’s decided that as well as vital equipment for the ward they wanted some of the money to be spent on the nurses, who work so tirelessly for the tiny babies in their care.“This year we wanted to put a bit of focus on the nurses and let them know we appreciate everything they do for sick new borns in Derry and beyond and especially our own twin girls,” explained Bob.“We asked the nurses to give us a list of stuff they needed for their tea room and of course we added a few extras and we are also going to buy them a new three seater sofa.“We felt it was very important that the nurses should have everything they need to make decent food.“It’s not a lot but it will make a dference to them.”“We want them to know that people are thinking of them and appreciate what they do.“The NHS canteen is closed when they are on night sht and at the minute I think all they have is a kettle and a toaster.googletag.cmd.push

night we are leaving our babies in their care.”The couple gave the nurses a voucher for a fridge freezer, cups, plates, cutlery, glasses a George Foreman grill, a set of knives, a radio and a £ MS voucher.And next month, they will present a cheque for the remaining £, to be spent on frontline services at the unit.“It was fantastic to catch up with some of the lovely nurses who did so much for our girls Cathy McClafferty Bridgeen Devine and Ciara Doherty and they passed on their thanks for the generosity of the public“We’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who made this possible including Michael Kelly who held a fundraiser at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park in the twins’ honour.”The tattoo fun day and last weekend’s sponsored walk have raised over £,, which will be donated to the unit next month.Mr McLaughlin says his employers and colleagues at First Source have played a huge part in helping them raise the £, over the past three years.“The management have been so supportive,” he continued.“They pick their own charity every year, but they also help a lot of smaller charities and a lot of it goes under the radar because they don’t advertise it.“When I brought my sponsorship form for the walk into work I raised £, in just five hours.“That’s how generous people in First Source are, there were people donating £ and £.”Picture Saorlaith and Saoirse

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said. I am delighted that this funding gives us the potential for its restoration and that future generations will also be able to enjoy the facility and engage with its heritage, he added.The local authority is keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the Walled Garden area designed to provide access via lt to its upper floor, with the local council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.Politicians were told last week that architects have been awarded the tender for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard and Rhododendron Wood areas, with work underway on planning and statutory approvals for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard.It has also been confirmed that a topographical survey mdash which could cost as much as pound, mdashwill be required to assist with the planning process.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.It is envisaged that initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the critically acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood.A critical look has also been taken of the parkrsquos traffic management and parking facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£700k environment scheme set to begin  ","story":"WORK on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick starts on January .The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the initiative which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the scheme to facilitate the contractor.The government department is making a pound, contribution to the public realm project, with the local authority providing the remainder of the cash for the eagerly-awaited revamp.Design proposals have revealed the work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year.The government department said funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.Local council officials are delighted to be working in partnership with the Department for Communities to deliver the project and are looking forward to the benefits that it will bring to Irish Street in terms of regenerating a central part of the town which has missed out on major public sector investment for several decades.Damian Mulholland mdash director of regional development with the Department for Communities mdash said recently that funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.He said the latest investment for Irish Street will enhance the natural heritage of the area at this historic part of the town and help improve visitors and resident experience.Councillor Dermot Curran says he is pleased work will start early in the New Year and has appealed to motorists to be patient during the lane closure.ldquoI realise this will inevitably have an impact on traffic, but hope roads officials will alter the sequencing of town centre traffic lights in a bid to minimise this, he continued. ldquoI hope the lane closure will be in place for the shortest time possible and will be liaising with contractors throughout the duration of the scheme.Cllr Curran said the scheme will help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents and help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment.He continued: ldquoBusiness owners in particular will be delighted that work is due to start soon. As I have said previously, Irish Street is ripe for redevelopment opportunities and this major investment is long overdue.Cllr Curran is also hopeful that Newry, Mourne and Down Council will make a fresh bid for Heritage Lottery Funding to help restore historic buildings within Downpatrickrsquos conservation area, which includes Irish Street.Several weeks ago it was confirmed that the local authorityrsquos initial bid for a so-called townscape initiative had been rejected, despite a signicant amount of time, effort and money being invested in the application process.Officials in charge of the heritage fund claimed the local authorityrsquos bid was influenced by planned regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area ldquorather than heritage need.In addition, they argued there was limited scope within Downpatrickrsquos townscape initiative area to deliver a ldquocomprehensive scheme and believed that given development proposals for Irish Street and the townrsquos former police base, the local authorityrsquos proposed scheme was ldquoinfluenced by regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area.Cllr Curran says he hopes a fresh application will meet with success to assist further the social and economic regeneration of not only Irish Street, but the wider town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch fete Schmidt  ","story":"IRELAND coach Joe Schmidt was the guest of honour at Ballymacarn Park on Friday when  members and guests enjoyed an excellent lunch followed by a question and answer session, conducted by club chairman Philip Gregg.He was his usual humble self as he described his coaching philosophy and the journey he has been on over the past  years and it was a wonderful afternoon for all in attendance.Despite his tight time schedule, Joe took the time to mingle with those present and was a complete gentleman throughout.

Environment Agency staff removed waste on  occasions.While the cost of removing waste over the past eight months is estimated at almost pound,, council officials have suggested the yearly total could top the pound, mark.The cost of flytipping on hard pressed ratepayers comes just a few weeks after council officials were asked to look at innovative ways of combating the problem.Councillors are concerned about the scale of the issue and the restrictions being placed on what material ratepayers can dump at household recycling centres.Some elected representatives have suggested council officials should reintroduce a service used by the former Down Council which arranged for a local authority bin lorry to visit some towns and villages on a Saturday morning to allow people to get rid of their household waste.The scheme proved extremely popular and while it was in service there were few reported flytipping incidents in the area.In addition, community groups helped keep their respective towns and villages clean by taking part in litter picks, with their efforts recognised by the local authority via an awards scheme.Councillors also believe the fact that some of the districtrsquos household recycling centres do not accept certain types of waste is contributing to the scale of the flytipping issue which, they say, must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 19%2C 1978  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash Fears that Newcastlersquos status as a leboat base could be thrown on the rocks were sunk yesterday by the Royal National Leboat Institutionrsquos chief spokesman in Ireland, Lt-Col Brian Clark.In a clear-cut statement he dashed the hopes of  Kilkeel fishermen who have called for a full-scale rescue centre to be set up in their port instead of Newcastle.Lt-Col Clark, who is the RNLIrsquos organising secretary for all of Ireland, has also hit out strongly at claims that the prospect of a tug-orsquo-war situation is looming between Newcastle and Kilkeel.He said: ldquoKilkeel has indeed been considered carefully as a possible location for a leboat, but the major requirement is that a boat must be able to get away from its base promptly in all kinds of weather.ldquoThe RNLI management committee feels that this capability is at present lacking in the case of Kilkeel where strong winds create unfavourable conditions at the entrance to the new harbour. These conditions could prevent a leboat from ing to its moorings and may prevent it from getting out of the harbour on service.Lord Roden, the honorary secretary of the Newcastle leboat station, has also rejected the latest call to switch the leboat base from his town to Kilkeel.ldquoI can give an assurance that Newcastle is taking no part in such an argument, he said. ldquoThe stationing of boats on the coast is solely a matter for the RNLI management committee.ldquoThe Newcastle leboatmen are proud of their boat.

Teddy wouldnrsquot worry sheep. He was far more interested in carrying my sonrsquos bag home from school and things like that. He was well known in the village and senior citizens were often thankful to have him around as a sort of watch dog.Mr Tweedie said there had been several cases of sheep worrying in the district recently and thatrsquos what led him to believe that a farmer may have shot him.He added: ldquoWe certainly miss him.

Because of ill health, she has to crawl up to her bedroom on hands and knees and get back down on hands and knees.Spearheading the Watsonsrsquo case has been their daughter, Mrs Jean Cheevers, and after a long struggle she has finally managed to get good news for her parents.After bringing her case to the attention of the local MP, Mr Enoch Powell, Mr Gerry Fitt MP, Cllr Rowan-Hamilton, the Sunday News and the Down Recorder, she has at last evoked a reaction from the Housing Executive.The Executive has now decided to take a ldquohumanitarian attitude to the couplersquos case, therefore increasing their chances of getting a stair-free home.In a sympathetic letter to Mrs Cheevers, an Executive spokesman explained that full consideration had been given to the age and state of health of Mr and Mrs Watson.ldquoI should add that our ability to rehouse your parents in accommodation suitable to their needs will be dependent on such accommodation becoming available in the area, the spokesman added.DOWNPATRICK mdash A bumper medieval pageant proposed for Downpatrick in May to celebrate St Patrick is hanging in the balance mdash and only a large turnout at a public meeting early in the New Year can save it from the chop.The pageant, the brainchild of Down Councilrsquos arts committee, is seen to be one of the best ideas to come out of the district for some time mdash but unless sufficient backing is forthcoming, then the community festival will have to be scrubbed.Organisers have been guaranteed funds from Down Council, but in order to quality for a big payout by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board will have to have the potential to be a major tourist attraction and to be continued each year.Mr Frank Connolly, a spokesman for the arts committee told the Recorder: ldquoIf there is no support, there will be no festival, itrsquos as simple as that. Wersquore calling a public meeting for January  in the new library in Downpatrick and itrsquos essential that there is a massive turnout of interested people and of organisations who are willing to play a part.ldquoA successful event would no doubt help tourism and itrsquos in the interest of the district to give it their full support.BALLYGOWAN mdash A young handicapped Ballygowan boy received an extra Christmas surprise recently when his pet donkey gave birth to a baby foal.Seven year-old Gregory Townley suffers from spina bida but the new addition to the family is certain to add an extra sparkle to Christmas for him.His mother, Mrs Myrtle Townley, said: ldquoMy husband got a donkey for Gregory two years ago after he bought a motorbike for my nine year-old son Roy.

Photo: Liam McBurney PA WireIt is a trend that is growing across the UK, with membership of the Outdoor Swimming Society up from  in  to , in .Cold water plunges are believed to have health benefits, including strengthening the nervous system.While some swimmers don wetsuits, a growing number of groups insist on “skins only”, ie swimming suits.The Donaghadee Chunky Dunkers in Co Down is one of the longest running groups in Northern Ireland. It includes younger and older swimmers, male and female, with a range of abilities who swim every day come rain, hail or snow.Martin Strain said the group has been going informally for eight years but has grown notably in the last three. He said cold water plungeshelp members who have mental health issues.In Bangor, the Brompton Belles and Beaux have a core who swim every day at am. Marie-Therese Davis-Hanson started the group in  and said numbers have rocketed.One of the newest groups is Team Dash and Splash, whose members run along the coast before a plunge at Pickie Beach, Bangor on Sunday morning. Member and former Olympic swimmer Andrew Bree said it has been a big change from the warm indoor pools of his competitive career.“The water temperature gets down to around four five degrees in February and March here,” he said.“I got injured in  and left the sport not the way I wanted to and I think that affected me, but now I have found that love for the water again.“It strips the ego, when you get into the cold, there is no room for the past, there is no room for thoughts, you are focused on the present moment.Family’s thanks for Parker’s gt of le Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“My benefit was definitely mental, but there has also been a cardiovascular benefit, I have taken up more running and things I didn’t use to do. I come from a swimming background but I never liked running.“I think it’s from the cold, you are pumping that blood through the body, I just feel overall really good from it.”Dash and Splash founder Scott Riley said it started with a Facebook post in October .“I was going for a run and sea swim anyway, I got really interested in the health benefits of cold water and I was training to become a Wim Hof method instructor at that time which is a breathing and cold training technique for strengthening the nervous system,” he said.“The first week,  people turned up. It has grown and grown ever since. Even in January February there were - people turning up each week.“At our anniversary swim in October we had  people taking part.“There seems to be a push towards more outdoor activity, I think people intuitively know that it’s good for them, and maybe a societal sht where back in the day kids used to go out and get involved in nature, then computers came along and people got more indoor-oriented, but now the pendulum is shting back and people are realising that getting outdoors makes you happier, healthier and stronger.”try catch  TrendingMissing person found safe and wellEx-Isle of Man TT racer and TV presenter Guy Martin denies having fake Irish driving licenceGalgorm Resort and Spa evacuatedTwo stabbed: Man arrested on suspicion of attempted murderBrit-bashing by Irish will not change: Wilson          ..

And on Boxing Day millions of us will sit at home, stuffed and exhausted, and mutter to each other, ‘Thank goodness that’s over’.Christmas is a time when so many of us have much to be grateful forI used to hate Christmas. Really hated it. It reminded me that I knew nothing about my first five Christmases, because I’d blocked them out – as I’d blocked out everything  – when I was put in an orphanage at the age of four. My adoptive parents were brilliant and I wanted for nothing when it came to presents and love. But at the back of my mind – and it was there for decades – was the fear that Christmas Past, and how I was parted from my original family, would come back and find me and do exactly the same thing again: tear me from those closest to me. That’s why I hated the jollity. That’s why I never felt comfortable with all the talk about the importance of family. That’s why Christmas tended to leave me cold.It’s dferent today. I still have dficulty with it and I fully understand the sadness and fear it holds for many people. But I have children of my own now something I thought I would never have. And on Christmas morning – and a lot will depend what time they wake up to plunder their stockings – we’ll all be sitting in bed together. It is extraordinary to think that these children wouldn’t existit weren’t for Kerri and me. The looks and quirks they have, come through us. The lessons and values they’ll carry into le and pass on to their own children come through us. Because of my own background I want to make sure that they remember all their Christmases and that those memories are mostly good ones. Good memories are useful companions on dark days.Later we’ll all go downstairs to the lounge to see what Santa has left at the fireplace. Megan, who is , still loves this moment and ‘plays the game’ for Lilah-Liberty, nine, and Indy,  months. If there is anything more lovely than the shiny-eyed delight of a child unwrapping their ‘special’ gt from Santa and wondering how he managed to get it down the chimney, then I have yet to see it. Having no memory of the experience myself I particularly cherish the memories of seeing my own children enjoy it.My Christmas probably sounds terribly corny. So what  It’s my Christmas and my memories. I have a particular and very special kind of happiness that I never expected to have. That’s probably why I cry now when I watch It’s A Wonderful Le. Before I met Kerri and before Christmases were shared with her and the childrenI dismissed the ‘awful nonsense’ pedalledin Miracle On th Street, Scroogeand It’s A Wonderful Le. Today, I couldn’t imagine Christmas without those films. They make me feel better. They make me believe that it is possible to change lives: and a belief in what might be possible is a very powerful force for good in a dficult world.Eventhe religious side of Christmas means nothing to you, it is still a time for looking back and counting your blessings: a time when so many of us have much to be grateful for. I’m well aware that there are people – far too many,truth be known –who still find it terribly dficult to imagine hope, let alone blessings worth counting. Empty chairs changed circumstances unresolved family spats marital break-ups le-changing accidents death unemployment. All of these take their toll. I have known that toll in my own le. But I also know that there is no such thing as a situation that can’t be addressed and improved: particularlythere are others who are willing to help. Everyone we see, everyone we meet, has an impact upon us. Everyone is capable of helping someone . In my own case I was rescued and rebuilt by two people, who knew almost nothing about me, taking a huge leap of faith and adopting me. As the author Matt Haig noted, “The thing that defines a human being is being a human”.So, wherever, however and with whom you spend it, I hope Christmas will be as kind to you as possible.

Christians celebrate the FACT of the birth of Jesus Christ.Far from being helpful to those members of society who do not have a clear grasp of the history of Christmas, Brian’s article wants to tell us that mankind can make this world a better place by his own “ability to redeem himself”, as is his opinion of the experience of Ebenezer Scrooge . History, right up to this very moment in time, has proven that man is as far from redeeming himself as he ever has been. The state of the world speaks that loud and clear!His humanist mask slips when he asks the question “does Christmas really make us more aware of the earth’s appalling poverty and man’s inhumanity to man and other animals ” Two points need to be made here , First , ‘earth’s appalling poverty’ is very largely the result of man’s corruption in government and greed for money.The world’s poorest nations are chiefly ruled by corrupt governments. Second, ‘man’s inhumanity to man, and other animals’ reveals his, and Humanism’s belief, that man is only a higher level of animal. But enough of humanism. Let’s think about what Christmas means.The birth of Jesus Christ was God the Father’s gt to this sinful world. He came to declare the Father’s love for the world, which sin had so disfigured . At His birth our Lord Jesus was wrapped in ‘swaddling bands’. These were the strips of cloth a body would normally have been bound with for burial. This pictures the fact that He was born, to die, just as He did on a cross at Caly. The death of Jesus Christ is confirmed in ancient Jewish and Roman records. He came to die in the place of sinful humanity. He was God and man clothed in the flesh of one body. Humanism is the belief thatGod absolutely does not exist,as a consequence, there is no afterle,there is no Heaven and no hell. What a depressing philosophy!Every humanist, every atheist has to just go on believing you are merely a collection of atoms brought together to somehow bring about a le, a le with no purpose, no future, no point really. You die, you’re gone , to where I, and millions like me, will celebrate the FACT that God “became flesh and dwelt among us” . We will go on celebrating the fact that “God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us”and that “He was buried, and that He rose again the third day, according to the scriptures”. The born-again Christian has a most wonderful prospect in view. For, just as He has come once, our Lord Jesus Christ has said, “I will come again, and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also”.

Letter to the editorThe faculty are ‘Internationally Renowned Experts’ who are ‘experienced and active practitioners. Students for theology at Queen’s have a ‘ per cent overall satisfaction rate for their degree in the most recent National Student Survey results , ranked joint th in the UK.’ ‘The excellent standards of our education are recognised by employers who value the quality of our programmes and recognise the skills of our graduates.’Those aren’t actually my words, but the words of Queen’s University, promoting the BA Theology course taught by Union Theological College. To this day those words remain on their website, encouraging students to study at a high-class educational institute.QAA, the independent organisation which assess higher education in the UK, speaks in similarly glowing terms in its  review of the college, praising ‘The culture of supporting students and the meticulous care taken to foster personal growth and academic attainment’ as an area of good practice. They note the ‘very strong sense of community among staff and students, which enhances the students’ learning experience’ and highlight activities which ‘reflect a culture of student-centeredness and underpin the trust between students and staff, which enhances student engagement.’It is hard to understand how a college praised by independent assessors and promoted enthusiastically by Queen’s can suddenly be seen as unfit to teach. How can a college which helps students ‘develop breadth of vision and understanding of the place and role of Theology and Religion, in both the past and the present’ be unsuitable for ‘today’s post-conflict Northern Ireland’  Union seems to be getting blame for allegedly coming from a single denominational perspective. But a few years ago there were four colleges from a iety of backgrounds working with Queen’s. Now none are teaching undergraduate courses for Queen’s and some partner with universities in England where the likes of Oxford, Cambridge, and Durham all work with denominational colleges.

turkey and ham, potatoes, roast potatoes, chipolata sausage, stuffing and gravy as well as vegetables.They willbe distributed to the homeless.“That’ll be my good deed done for the year,” he said laughing.However Stephen is no stranger to helping those less fortunate and already organises free Sunday meals for a few elderly members who have lost their wives and are alone.And it’s not just the homeless who are getting a free dinner this year.Simon has been inundated with people who are struggling to make ends meet this Christmas.“We have been contacted by people living alone, people who are disadvantaged,” said Stephen.Sinn Fein poll slump is new setback for Mary Lou McDonaldMan due in court on firearms charge after early-morning incident Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“I got a call from one woman who said she also had no toys for the kids and no dinner for them. “I told her I had some toys belonging to his own kids that I could give her,” said the kind-hearted chef. “She said she is going to send someone out in a taxi on Sunday to collect them as she doesn’t drive.“So I am going to feed the family and throw in a few toys as well,” said Stephen who is from Portaferry.Another woman rang him as she had just got out of hospital and was alone.Stephen said it’s his first time doing anything like this but had worked for a charity for blind people in London.The whole idea was cooked up with a friend over a game of snooker last Wednesday night and within days it snowballed.Asked how it was being funded, Stephen said: “I’m just doing it off my own bat.” And he is being helped by his Golf Club colleagues.try catch  TrendingPerhaps it is Queenrsquos University that is out of step with academia, not Union Theological CollegeArlene Fosterrsquos Christmas message reflects on lsquoyear of uncertaintyrsquoMissing person found safe and wellExperienced BBCNI journalist joins RTEThis is what N.I. prisoners will be eating on Christmas Day          ..

He ruffled an EU official’s hair upon arriving at a Brussels summit earlier this month and was later involved in a public dispute with Theresa May, denying her claims that he called her nebulous.Mr Varadkar defended the politician as a “very good supporter of Ireland”.“I have absolute and immense confidence in Jean Claude Juncker who has been a very effective EU Commission president over the last couple of years, was a long-serving prime minister of Luxembourg and has been a very good colleague of mine and a very good supporter of Ireland,” he said.“I have never once seen him anything other than sober and he has sciatica and walks in a particular way and some elements of the media make that out to be related to alcohol. It’s not. I know it’s not. And secondly, I was there, he didn’t call Prime Minister May nebulous.“I think he was referring to some of the requests or demands from the UK but that wasn’t a remark about her personally.“Probably ill-advised to fluff other people’s hair though. I wouldn’t do that myself.”In London, the Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said of Mr Juncker: “He’s ghastly.” The Tory MP said: “What I minded were those pictures of the way he was holding the prime minister.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flat1.jpg","title":"belfasts flatiron building takes on first tenants","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew A design agency has become the first tenant of a newly renovated Victorian listed building with another business expected to become the second soon, Ulster Business can reveal.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house1.jpg","title":"ulster rugby player developing luxury homes","story":"Posted on Friday  December  by John Mulgrew A series of new luxury homes are being developed by an Ulster Rugby player in east Belfast, Ulster Business can reveal.Craig Gilroy, alongside developer Austin Baird, is currently building two large detached properties on a site at his home close to the Belmont Road.Work is under way on the properties, which will include a five-bedroom and six-bedroom development.“One of the properties is around , sq ft and the other , sq ft – we are still working on a price,” Mr Gilroy said.“The market seems to be pretty good, looking at the other properties in the area.”He said the properties will come to market in the next few weeks.
