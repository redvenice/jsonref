We didn\u0027t attack Ukraine, either.\u0027  And there were indications Lavrov didn\u0027t have the power to negotiate a cease fire.\u0027The broad narrative he conveyed to me is that they will continue their aggression until Ukraine meets their demands, and the least of these demands is surrender,\u0027 Kuleba told reporters after his meeting with Lavrov and Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu of Turkey.Lavrov said Putin would not refuse a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky but it would have to be substantive and focus on specifics. And he said in reference to the hospital attack: \u0027It is not the first time we see pathetic outcries concerning the so-called atrocities perpetrated by the Russian military.\u0027He made outlandish claims that the hospital had been taken over by Ukrainian radicals and all the \u0027mothers and nurses were chased out of there\u0027.The foreign minister also accused the West of providing Ukraine with weapons.He said: \u0027We see how dangerously our Western colleagues, including in the European Union, are acting now, which, in violation of all its so-called principles and values, encourages the supply of deadly weapons to Ukraine.\u0027Meanwhile his counterpart Kuleba blasted the \u0027difficult\u0027 meeting, accusing Lavrov of bringing \u0027traditional narratives\u0027 about Ukraine to the negotiating table.He said after the failed talks: \u0027I want to repeat that Ukraine has not surrendered, does not surrender, and will not surrender.\u0027  Russia has demanded that Ukraine cease military action, change its constitution to enshrine neutrality so it cannot join the EU or NATO, recognise Crimea as sovereign Russian territory and recognise the separatist republics of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent territories."},{"url":null,"title":"China refusing supply Russia aircraft parts Western sanctions Moscow admits","story":"Share this article Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries tweeted that Chelsea FC will be able to operate under a \u0027special licence\u0027.The team will be able to play fixtures and pay staff, but trading in players seems to be off the table.Only \u0027existing ticket holders\u0027 will be able to attend matches.It appears that means only season ticket holder, and away fans will not be permitted. There is also the prospect that Champions League games will be played effectively behind closed doors, as those tickets are often purchased separately from season tickets.Merchandise sales are also expected to end. Ms Dorries said the aim was to ensure that Abramovich cannot \u0027benefit from his ownership of the club\u0027. Mr Abramovich is worth 10.4bn ($12.5bn), according to Forbes, and owns a £150million Kensington mansion, a £22million West London penthouse, and more than £1.2bn of yachts, private jets, helicopters and supercars based in Britain and around the world.His two superyachts may already be out of reach. £430million Solaris was moored in Barcelona a week ago but is now off the Sicily coast, believed to be heading to Israel, where he holds citizenship. The £540million Eclipse is currently in open sea off the coast of the British Virgin Islands in the Caribbean.In London, his staff are said to have been ready for viewings at his 15-bedroom mansion at Kensington Palace Gardens, valued at more than £150m, and a three-storey penthouse at Chelsea Waterfront, worth an estimated £22m.Chelsea FC is his most valuable British asset, after the oligarch transformed its fortunes from outside challengers to Premier League giants with the help of Jose Mourinho and huge signings like Didier Drogba, so its sale will be a personal blow to the billionaire industrialist. The country is facing the gravest economic crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union after crippling sanctions were imposed on almost its entire financial and corporate system. Many companies  - including McDonald\u0027s, Starbucks, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and General Electric - have also hit Russia\u0027s economy by temporarily suspending business in the country.Major retailers such as Zara, H\u0026ampM, Ikea and many others have also suspended sales in Russia, closing their doors in many shopping centres in the capital Moscow. The world\u0027s top fashion houses such as Gucci, Prada, Dior and Fenti also shut from Monday.The sanctions have seen the US cut off the Russian central bank, effectively preventing Americans from doing business with it and severely limiting Russia\u0027s ability to defend its currency.The US also imposed sanctions on the state investment fund, with an official saying Joe Biden intended to ensure the Russian economy \u0027goes backward as long as Putin goes forward with his invasion of Ukraine\u0027. As of the morning of March 9, $1USD was equal to 133 Russian roubles.

Somebody had to take the initiative, but he agreed that the residents should be consulted and if they thought the proposal was a bad idea they could oppose it. He acknowledged that they could come under community pressure.It was important to send a clear message to the Russian State.

More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics pearse doherty on sinn f%C3%A9in s policies a united ireland and issues of security and neutrality","story":"Sinn Féin finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty joins Hugh and Pat to discuss what his party\u0027s priorities and policies would be, if they were to lead the next government.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireIreland’s consumer watchdog has said there are “no legal barriers” to petrol stations independently increasing prices and it does not have a role in monitoring such increases.The statement from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) comes after politicians called for it to investigate alleged price-gouging by fuel companies. Excise cuts of 20 cent per litre of petrol and 15 cent on diesel kicked in from midnight as part of Government efforts to mitigate a sharp increase in fuel costs linked to the war in Ukraine. However, there have been claims that some fuel providers hiked prices just before the excise cut as well as suggestions that prices are still rising.Government and Opposition politicians have called for a CCPC investigation.The CCPC indicated, though, that it requires evidence of cartel behaviour before it would launch an investigation.In a statement it saidthat “there are no legal barriers to petrol stations acting independently to increase their prices”. “The CCPC does not have a role in monitoring price increases in the market. “If businesses collude to fix prices this is cartel behaviour and the CCPC can investigate and refer a case to the DPP for criminal prosecution.”It said further information on cartels and how the public can submit evidence to the CCPC is available on its website. Earlier, the Minister of State for Consumer Protection Robert Troy encouraged people to report any evidence of cartel behaviour.He said his officials are working with the CCPC to ensure consumers are aware of their rights and businesses are aware of their obligations. “If any consumer has evidence of cartel behaviour or abuse of dominance with regards to high fuel costs, they should contact the CCPC who can investigate,” Mr Troy added. Representatives of the sector said it could be a number of days before the cut in excise is reflected in the price at the pumps.Kevin McPartlan, chief executive of industry body Fuels for Ireland, said the reduction in excise has had “some impact” but it won’t be felt by many just yet.“Excise is payable at the point at which they leave the terminal and it’s paid in advance a lot of the time. So the fuels stored in the forecourts, and being used today, had already paid the higher rate of excise,” he said. “They have to get rid of the stock they bought at the higher excise before prices come down.”Mr McPartlan denied claims that filling stations were price-gouging or profiteering ahead of the excise reduction, adding that the allegations were “so far from the truth”.Further increases expectedAnna Cullen, spokeswoman with AA Ireland, said some filling stations had dropped prices but that it was “mixed” overall and up to inidual forecourts to decide. However, Ms Cullen said even if prices come down in the coming days, these would still be among the highest since the AA began recording data in 1991. She said she expected further increases in the weeks ahead.Laois-Offaly TD Barry Cowen has written to the CCPC saying he is concerned some retailers may be engaging in “price gouging”.“Photos have been shared on social media of the high cost of petrol and diesel per litre, with assertions being made that the cost increased dramatically overnight – sometimes apparently by the sum of the planned Government reduction in excise duty,” he wrote.A spokeswoman for Applegreen service stations welcomed the temporary reduction in fuel excise duties, but said they “do not go far enough to mitigate completely the cost price increases we have experienced as a result of unprecedented volatility in the wholesale fuel market”. Separately, in a statement issued to The , Circle K denied it was artificially inflating prices at any of its forecourts around Ireland in order to take advantage of the excise cuts.“Our pricing is set in line with local and international market movements and wholesale market costs. This was the case today and the same process is adhered to anytime there are price changes,” he continued.He stressed that the current climate was ‘unprecedented” and stressed that the Russian invasion of Ukraine was having a “significant impact and leading to price pressures which is a challenge for all fuel retailers.”He said Circle K was “continuously focused on delivering the very best value for our customers, however the current level of volatility within global markets driven by intense demand is posing a major challenge for everyone in the sector”The company’s spokesman concluded by saying Circle K was committed to passing on any reductions to the cost of refined petrol and diesel products globally although he warned that it was likely there would be further “pressure on prices in the coming weeks”. ‘Immediately eroded’Speaking in the Dáil on Thursday, Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said the Taoiseach was working with EU colleagues at a summit in France on the issue of taxes on energy in an attempt to find ways to help consumers handle rising fuel costs. The Minister was responding to Sinn Féin deputy leader Pearse Doherty, who called for further cuts to excise duties. Mr Doherty said the reduction announced by the Government had been “immediately eroded” and that “prices are going to continue to go up and up”. “You need to understand that people are panicking and they need support from Government,” Mr Doherty said. Mr Ryan acknowledged people were “very upset” this morning, as they were looking at forecourts and seeing that the price of petrol and diesel had not changed. The problem, he said, was that this price was probably set when fuels were bought ahead of the excise reduction. Mr Doherty also said that people “don’t need to be told to slow down, they’re telling you hurry up, get your act together and get these prices down further”. This was a reference to Mr Ryan on Wednesday saying people should drive more slowly as a practical step to reduce their fuel consumption. On Thursday, The Minister said: “That advice to slow down got a lot of criticism yesterday, but it was an answer to a straight question what are the sort of efficiency measures we could do and it’s just a fact.”Mr Ryan said if a person travelling on a motorway went from 120 kmh down to 100kmh they could save “about 20 per cent plus”. “That’s real, that’s absolute law of physics and that measure is also important.” Speaking in the Dáil, Fine Gael TD Fergus O’Dowd called for “dawn raids” on fuel companies. He said petrol dealers are challenging the authority of the Government “by not passing on the full discount in many cases to consumers”.He also said the public “need to flood the CCPC with complaints because they will only act if they have those complaints”.Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore said she had written to the CCPC asking it to launch an investigation.

Sir Ernest Shackleton’s polar exploration ship had last been seen 107 years ago when it was slowly crushed and then sunk by pack ice, and until very recently had been thought lost forever.Yet four days on from the discovery, 69-year-old Bound confesses – on an in-and-out phone line from Antarctica – that the enormity of the achievement, the peak of a stellar career of over 40 years that has earned him the nickname ‘the Indiana Jones of the Deep’, has yet to sink in. His head is still spinning.“Shackleton has been a lifelong thing for me,” he explains. He grew up in the nearby Falkland Islands – and still has a home there – where the polar explorer’s “greatest escape of all time” in leading his crew of 27 to safety after the loss of their ship has made him the enduring local hero. “I have with me right now a book on Shackleton that I was given for regular Sunday school attendance in the 1960s,” he says. Indeed some reports have even suggested that Bound is related to Shackleton, who at the time of the sinking had been attempting to make the first crossing of Antarctica. “At that point,” says Bound calmly, “we knew it must be Endurance because it is the only shipwreck that is down there.”   It was only when they switched to cameras, however, that what was revealed “sent shivers up my spine,” he says. Even more extraordinary in a life-changing moment of superlatives was the state of preservation of Shackleton’s ship. “Without any exaggeration this is the finest wooden shipwreck I have ever seen – by far – sitting upright, bold and beautiful and largely intact.” The combination of the extreme icy cold at that depth – “water is a brilliant preservative” – and the absence in the Weddell Sea of wood-eating marine organisms that feast on timber wrecks elsewhere has produced what Bound refers to simply as “magic”.   “You can see a porthole that is Shackleton’s cabin. At that moment, you really do feel the breath of the great man upon the back of your neck. You can even see the paintwork. It is in such a good state that I felt in that moment we could almost raise her and sail off.” Almost. The Antarctic Treaty contains strict rules on disturbing wrecks but, even if it was allowed to bring Endurance to the surface, the technology needed is not yet available. “Not in my lifetime,” Bound says. “Conservation science hasn’t reached that stage, but in 40 or 50 years…” So speaks a man whose life has been defined by a fascination with the oceans. “I was always enthralled by the sea growing up. I was going out on a schooner when I was still a boy.” He was christened Michael, but has always been known as Mensun, his childhood mispronunciation of the word “medicine”, after a bout of severe illness. At 11, he was sent to secondary school in Uruguay.After a spell on a merchant ship in his late teens, he studied history and then archaeology at university first in the US and then at Oxford, where he still lives with his wife Joanna and three grown-up children. In the early 1980s he made his name excavating an Etruscan shipwreck from the sixth century BC off the Italian island of Giglio, and went on to head the first academic marine archaeology unit in England at Oxford. But part of him has always belonged in the South Atlantic.  In the next day or two, the expedition’s icebreaker, SS Agulhas II, will stop off en route for South Africa on the uninhabited South Georgia, a Falkland Islands dependency until 1985. This was where Shackleton led his men to safety after an 800-mile open-boat journey. And it is where the man they called “the Boss” was buried in Grytviken Cemetery in a funeral that took place exactly 100 years to the day before Endurance was rediscovered.  Some argue that wrecks should be left where they are, especially if they are the last resting place of those who died in them, though that wasn’t the case with Endurance. Bound believes that one day it should be brought to the surface. “Even though it is so well-preserved, the longer we leave it there as pollution increases and sea temperature and acidity rise, the more it will rot and what we have found will be gone, lost to learning and to heritage,” he says. For Bound, she is more than a ship. There is the whole escape saga of Shackleton and his crew.  “He wasn’t the two-dimensional Edwardian hard man that he is sometimes portrayed as. With all his bravery, determination, leadership skills as well as his imperfections, Shackleton should be as important in our national bloodstream as the likes of Nelson and Churchill.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Sanctions will send global food prices \u0026#39soaring\u0026#39, warns Vladimir Putin Cancelling Tchaikovsky is ignorant and wetRussia-Ukraine war: Listen to our daily podcastUkraine-Russia evening briefing: Five developments as Russia says it has seized two gas facilitiesNervous Disney chiefs ‘censor gay affection’ from box-office hitsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cannot allow russia become north korea","story":"North Korea has been a pariah state for more than seventy years. Its nuclear weapons programme and missile tests make headlines but, fundamentally, it is a “Hermit Kingdom” cut off from the outside world. Even its Chinese allies are viewed with deep suspicion. Yet the Kim dynasty’s rule there has lasted since 1948.Russia may soon be about to experience the same fate. If the Western alliance wants to isolate Russia as severely as North Korea, we could inadvertently grant Vladimir Putin and his chosen successor decades of tenure in the Kremlin. Squeeze Putin until the pips squeak is an understandable reaction to the Russian invasion, but is it wise? The question is whether cutting Russia off from other sectors, such as media, would in fact benefit the Kremlin\u0027s information operation. North Korea cracks down on “spiritual pollution” with  gusto. A recent Russian visitor to the country told me how shocking the lack of private cynicism of Kim\u0027s regime there was. Whereas ordinary Soviet citizens sneered at the Party line in the 1980s, almost complete isolation from outside contacts has enabled Pyongyang to fill people’s minds with the official version of events. Kim Jong Un is safe so long as North Korea is isolated from the West. Vladimir Putin may well think he can stay in the Kremlin so long as the West targets young Russians as cultural pariahs. We may think that depriving them of contact with the wider world – and cancelling everything from Tchaikovsky to Russian Netflix – will provoke a popular uprising in Moscow, but that does not account for the fact that neither North Koreans nor Cubans have not risen en masse on the back of decades of stringent sanctions.History suggests that the killer for totalitarian regimes is in fact the relaxation of tensions. These autocrats need an enemy.Anyone who can remember how, for instance, the Reagan-Thatcher détente with Gorbachev led to much more contact between East and West can see how that did to erode Soviet communism. Even before that, participation in the Moscow Olympics in 1980 by Western spectators as much as athletes opened Russian eyes to the gap in lifestyles between “us and them”. Simple consumer gadgets like the Sony Walkman cassette player caused crowds to gather in admiration.Russian nationalists who regard Putin as “wet” on Western influence are delighted by every fast food restaurant shut and every Spotify subscription blocked by sanctions. President Biden and the EU  are closing Russia’s windows on the West far mote effectively than ever the Tsars’ censors or Soviet goons could.A generation of Russians whose minds lived in a Western-dominated cyber-space have been spurned by us. There is no guarantee that they will blame the Kremlin, rather than us, for that fact. An isolated Russia might well become North Korea on steroids, with the largest nuclear arsenal in the world.

But there are questions about how much he directly owns, and whether he sold any of it offRoman Abramovich made headlines for buying a mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens, billionaires row Image: Facundo Arrizabalaga MyLondonByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Mar |commentsFor the man who had everything, a house on ‘billionaires’ row’ could be described as the ultimate prize. Cha FC owner Roman Abramovich made headlines in  for buying a £m mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens - a lavish street west of Hyde Park in central London.But under sanctions announced today, any UK property owned by Abramovich will be ‘frozen’ - with not even cleaners allowed to go in and clean it.This is because no financial transaction can take place in relation to a sanctioned asset - unless the Treasury issues a aposlicence’, as there is for Cha FC. That means the tycoon can’t rent his home out or sell it, can’t pay a cleaner to come and clean it, and can’t pay an electricity company to put the lights on or off. It would be a criminal offence for anyone to evade those sanctions. UK officials believe Abramovich has not only a multi-million pound property empire, but also private modes of transport such as planes and yachts.  Government officials do not currently believe the Cha tycoon is in the UK - and he is banned from travelling here under the measures announced today. Extra laws announced earlier this week would also allow the UK to detain a Russian aircraft which entered UK airspace.And officials are actively trying to work out whether any of Abramovich’s jets or yachts are on British territory. But critics raise questions about exactly how hard Abramovich will be hit. And given the complexity and legal niceties of sanctions, some of these questions are very hard to answer. The most important thing to note is Abramovich’s UK assets are still only “frozen” - not actually seized by the UK government.  Ministers have been discussing a new law to seize oligarchs’ UK mansions and even use them to house Ukrainian refugees, but nothing has been published yet. That means technically the tycoon’s family - who are not directly targeted with sanctions - could stay in his homes, though officials believe it would be practically very dficult. The second big question is what he actually owns. While sanctions are extremely complicated, they work on the broad principle that an asset belongs to an oligarchthey own at least % of it. The most recent Land Registry records show  Kensington Palace Gardens is technically owned by a Cyprus-based trustee company - “care of” a firm based at Cha FC.As well as this, Labour MP Chris Bryant claimed in Parliament nine days ago that the tycoon was rushing to sell off his UK property to avoid being caught by sanctions. He said in the Commons: “I think Roman Abramovich is terried of being sanctioned, which is why he is going to sell his home tomorrow, and another flat as well. “My anxiety is that we are taking too long about these things, and I have a suggestion that might help.” He added: “The danger is that Mr Abramovich will have sold everything by the time we get round to sanctioning him.” So while the effects on any frozen property are severe, the property has to be defined as frozen in the first place. The next question is enforcement. MPs have repeatedly raised concerns that the regime is just not strong enough and breaches of sanctions could go un-noticed.The one area where the rules are dferent is Cha FC, which Abramovich put up for sale just days ago, vowing to donate the proceeds to the humanitarian effort in Ukraine.It’s understood the club could be sold, and No today said it’s “open to” the idea - but it can only happena fresh licence is issued by the Treasury.A licence has already been issued for the essential s of keeping the club running -it hadn’t, the sanctions would have effectively shut it down with no financial transactions allowed. It allows Cha to carry on paying salaries and holding matches, but blocks any new idends to directors - and bans casual fans from attending matches. Only fans who bought a ticket or season ticket before  March  can attend a match or buy food from Stamford Bridge’s outlets. Player transfers or loans are also banned and the club cannot sell merchandise, either in-person or online. It will be for the Treasury to consider a further application for a licence to sell the club. Currently, no such request for that licence has been made. Any proceeds from the sale of the club would not be able to be given to Abramovich or any other sanctioned inidual. Government sources tried to dampen down fears Abramovich could donation the proceeds to charity, as that would still require a licence. It could also have to involve him being given the proceeds to donate, a potential breach of the sanction. The PM’s deputy official spokesman said: “The government is open to a sale of the club. “But currently it would require another licence and that would require further conversation with the Treasury and other departments.” If there was a sale, a spokesman added, “in no way could it benefit Roman Abramovich or find its way back to Russia, but it would depend on the detail of the sale.” The -year-old is worth an estimated £. billion and has a multi-million pound property empire in the UK, and also has stakes in steel giant Evraz and Norilsk Nickel. Days ago, Abramovich’s spokesperson - while declining to comment on the merits or otherwise of the war - said he was brokering peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.  Shutting off Russian banks’ access to the West, with plan to move to full asset freeze on all Russian banks.  Sanctions on Russian central bank and financial institutions, already in effect.  Preventing Russian firms and the Russian state raising debt in the UK, already enacted.  Asset freeze against inidual oligarchs, with  so far including Putin and Lavrov and more to come.  Targeting key strategic sectors including defence with more planned on services and energy.  Blocking access to SWIFT, with UK still pushing for a full SWIFT ban against all Russian banks.  Banning Russian planes and ships landing in UK, with new laws next week to put this on longer-term footing.  Banning export to Russia of ‘dual-use’ items such as electronics that could be used in military computers or weaponry.  Setting a £, limit on wealthy Russians’ deposits in UK bank accounts.  Extending the above sanctions to Belarus due to its role supporting the Russian invasion.  Extending UK-Crimea total trade embargo to the Luhansk and Donetsk ‘People’s Republics’. But still no date, due to concerns about protecting Ukrainians still there.  Sanctions on all members of Russian Parliament and Russian National Security who voted in support of invasion. Still in progress despite EU acting already. For more information click here.Abramovich has also denied having close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.But the UK government’s official listing of the reasons he has been sanctioned paints a very dferent picture. The official entry on the UK sanctions list published by the government describes him as a prominent Russian businessman and pro-Kremlin oligarch who has had a “close relationship for decades” with Putin. This association led to financial benefit or other material benefit from Putin and the Government of Russia , the listing states - including tax breaks received by companies linked to Abramovich, buying and selling shares from and to the state at favourable rates, and the contracts received in the run up to the FIFA  World Cup.The document also accuses Abramovich of being involved in destabilising Ukraine and undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, via Evraz PLC”. He “exercises effective control” of the steel and mining firm, which the UK says could be potentially supplying steel to the Russian military which may have been used in the production of tanks, the listing states.

Shadow Defence Minister Luke Pollard said: “Conservative ministers have cut the British Army to its smallest size in  years, with frontline troops bearing the brunt of these cuts. Our Armed Forces are essential to our national security and resilience. “With growing Russian aggression, the Government is pushing ahead with further cuts to the Army by , troops over the next three years. “Ministers must halt these cuts now.

A small number of serving British personnel are believed to have gone absent without leave to join the fight against the Russian invasion. Boris Johnson warned they would face court martial on theirto the UK, as Ministry of Defence chiefs have banned all service personnel from travelling to Ukraine “until further notice”.Armed forces minister James Heappey said earlier this week: “It is illegal for British service personnel to first of all go absent without leave in the first place, but to go absent without leave in order to fight in a foreign war is simply unacceptable, and frankly risks the United Kingdom being wrongly claimed by Russia to be a belligerent in this. “Service people who might think they are doing the right thing should reflect it is % not the correct thing to be doing.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyBritish ArmySoldiersWar crimesCrimePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Days after the party fundraiser, on July , , the passenger jet Malaysia Airlines flight  was shot down by a surface to air missile launched from pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory in Ukraine.And just months earlier, Putin had faced international condemnation over the annexation of Crimea.But speaking to LBC Radio’s Andrew Marr today, the former PM insisted Mrs Chernukhin had attempted “absolutely no influence” on UK policies on Russia.Askedhe remembered the game, he said: “I do, I remember - and there was absolutely no conversation about Russia, finance, Putin or anything .”  “We had a very careful system for vetting who could and could not give money to the Conservative Party. “A small handful of people had any connections with Russia, and as I’m concerned most of them were dissidents, often Ukrainians.” Mrs Chernukhin was born in Russia, studied in the United States and became a British citizen in .

Boris Johnson announced an inquiry last year after fury at his slow decisions to lock down, which scientists believe cost lives.It will start hearings in the spring and publish any reports in a timely manner, though many fear this will not happen until the next election.Todayaposs draft Terms of Reference do not name Boris Johnson or promise to look at the inidual behaviour of the Prime Minister. That could come as a blow to bereaved families after ex-aide Dominic Cummings accused him of a litany of failings.But they do vow to look at how prepared the government was and how decisions were made, communicated and implemented, including in the disastrous month before lockdown was imposed on  March . While the inquiry will not investigate inidual cases, it will listen to bereaved families and seek to learn lessons for any future pandemic.Scroll down for the full terms of reference - or have your say in the comments. Importantly it will also have reasonable regard to relevant international comparisons, suggesting the levels of death and disease in the UK could be compared to other European nations. And it will look at the response for shielding people, the poorest forced to rely on sick pay of less than £ a week, and those subject to aposdo not resuscitateapos orders. It will examine the response for care homes, where the virus swept through killing tens of thousands of people despite ministers pledging a aposprotective ringapos. But the inquiry will also look at the merits and problems of lockdown itself, not just the virus response that triggered it.Becky Kummer, spokesperson for Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, said: “The inquiry is a one off and historic opportunity for the terrible suffering and loss of the past two years to be learned from, to ensure these tragedies are not repeated in the future. “The Government finally publishing the draft Terms of Reference is a huge step forward, and we look forward to feeding into the consultation on them. “Sadly, today’s announcement comes far too late. We will never know how many lives could have been saved had the Government had a rapid review phase in Summer , as we called for at the time. “Crucially, Boris Johnson must now commit to implementing the chairaposs recommendations for the Terms Of Reference in full. The fact his office is under police investigation for breaching their own rules means thathe attempts to interfere with what the inquiry looks into, it risks ruining its credibility before it’s even begun.” Boris Johnson suggested the terms of reference will changethere are complaints, as there will be a four-week period to consult on them. He said: It is vital that we get its terms of reference right and that people can have their say. To deliver this, Baroness Hallett will now lead a period of public engagement and consultation, which will last for four weeks. This process will inform further refinements to the terms of reference before they are finalised and the inquiry begins its important work. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said the findings must be delivered before the next general election.” Here is the full list of whataposs been announced today by the government, in the governmentaposs own words.

In meeting these aims, the inquiry will:listen to the experiences of bereaved families and others who have suffered hardship or loss as a result of the pandemic.

Abramovich, who is worth an estimated £. billion and has a multi-million pound property empire in the UK, also has stakes in steel giant Evraz and Norilsk Nickel, the UK Government said. He sold a % stake in Russian oil firm Sibneft to state-owned gas titan Gazprom for £. billion in . He recently announced plans to sell the top-flight football club, which he has owned since , after initially saying he was passing stewardship to the clubaposs charitable foundation. Abramovich has denied having strong ties with Putin but the Government said he had had received financial benefits from the Kremlin, including tax breaks for his companies, the buying and selling of shares from and to the state at favourable rates, and contacts in the run up to the  World Cup in Russia.The list shows he has been sanctioned both on the basis of his personal connections to the Kremlin and preferential contracts over the years, but also the role the Evraz steel company plays - the British government believe it is providing steel to the Russian military The football club has now been seized by the UK Government but ministers have issued a licence authorising Cha to continue playing matches. Season ticket holders and those with games already booked can still attend matches, but no new tickets can be sold and the clubaposs merchandise shop will close. Abramovich’s UK property will also be frozen with not even cleaners allowed to enter it. But the asset is still only “frozen” - not actually seized by the UK government. Technically the tycoon’s family - who are not directly targeted with sanctions - could stay in his homes but officials believe it would be practically very dficult. Oleg Deripaska Industrialist Oleg Deripaska, who is Abramovichaposs former business partner, was among those newly added to the sanctions list. The Russian tycoon has stakes in En+ Group, a major extractives and energy company which owns UC Rusal, one of the world’s major aluminium producers. Deripaska is estimated to be worth £billion, with a multi-million pound property portfolio in the UK.  He hit the headlines in  when he hosted Labour grandee Lord Peter Mandelson and then-shadow chancellor George Osborne on his yacht in Corfu. Mr Osborne was accused of trying to solicit a donation for the Tory party from the oligarch - something he denies. The US designated Deripaska in , which is means a personaposs assets are blocked and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from dealing with them. Igor Sechin Tycoon Igor Sechin is the chief executive of Rosneft, the Russian state oil company. The UK Government described him as a particularly close and influential ally of Putin and he is understood to be regarded as Putinaposs number two.  He has already been sanctioned by the US and EU. The French Government seized a yacht linked to the oligarch last week. Andrey Kostin Andrey Kostin is the chairman of VTB bank, Russiaaposs second largest bank. The bank was designated by the UK last month. The UK put his net worth at an estimated £ million. Kostin was described by the FCDO as a close associate of Putin, and has long supported Kremlin objectives through the bank.  He has previously accused the West of waging economic war against Russia through sanctions. He has already been sanctioned by the US and EU. Alexei Miller The chief executive of Russian energy company Gazprom is one of the most important executives supporting the Kremlin. Miller served under Putin in the s when the now-President was deputy mayor in St Petersburg. UK officials believe he has been going along his career trajectory with Putin since the Russian President was was deputy mayor of St Petersburg in s.  Miller has already been sanctioned by the US. Nikolai Tokarev Nikolai Tokarev is president of the Russia state-owned pipeline company Transneft. He served alongside Putin in the KGB in Dresden, East Germany, in the s. They have remained closely associated ever since. Tokarev has been sanctioned by the US and EU. Dmitri Lebedev Dmitri Lebedev is the chairman of the Board of Directors of Bank Rossiya. The UK designated Bank Rossiya, widely considered to be the Kremlin’s private bank, on  February . Lebedev was sanctioned by the US in .

You had to pinch yourself to realise that until very recently our Prime Minister spent every appearance here refusing to admithe’d held parties in his own flat. Yet here was the leader of a major European country being brutally honest about the devastating shelling of flats by an invading army in cities three hours away from the UK on a budget flight.As Volodymyr Zelensky outlined the crimes being unleashed by a “gangster state” the assembled MPs, wearing headphones and grim expressions on the packed benches, gave the big, hushed room the feel of a war crimes court. Hopefully a modern-day Nuremberg awaits Zelensky’s nemesis, Putin. The Ukrainian leader pointed out he was addressing everyone in the UK, as a fellow citizen of the world. And dressed in his trademark green tee-shirt he looked the part. As he gave us a breakdown of the horrors happening in his homeland, with eyes heavy and face drawn, it could have been someone you’d just met talking you through a personal tragedy. If anything encapsulates the Spirit of Ukraine it is this man. If anything says Putin won’t win it is Zelensky’s defiant demeanour. His presence in our parliament, like his message, was simple. It said: “I’m not hiding, I’m not afraid. We will endure.” Other world leaders have addressed Westminster before such as Barack Obama and Angela Merkel. But whereas they felt like they were taking part in some mutual admiration ceremony, this felt real. It felt urgent.  Whenever we turn our TVs on we see voiceless children and pensioners scrambling for their lives, and here was their voice. Here was their living symbol of resistance. Here was a man telling us, from the heart, why we cannot further abandon those innocent civilians who do not deserve their plight. Yet who do deserve our protection. It made you ashamed of the listening government’s pathetic response to the refugee crisis, with the pitul amount of visas they’ve handed out and the bureaucratic hoops they are making desperate people jump through to get them. Zelensky is what we hope we would all be when put under the most intolerable of pressure. Cool and courageous. This former actor is suddenly making speeches on the hoof that the finest dramatists would be proud of. For his British audience he evoked Shakespeare, saying there was no question of whether Ukraine’s fate was “to be or not to be.” It was to be. He pushed the British patriotic buttons even harder when he summoned the spirit of Winston Churchill, vowing to fight the Russian enemy in the fields and in the forests. Johnson gave a knowing smile of recognition when he heard that. Priti Patel sat there smirking by his side throughout, as she does. And when Zelensky talked about dramatically increasing sanctions, Rishi Sunak’s eyebrows twitched as he did the sums.  To hear him speak is to realise how badly Putin underestimated the will of Ukrainians. It’s the sense of calm he projects that has kept his nation going in the face of horrendous oppression. At the end of his -minute speech, during a long standing ovation, some MPs wiped away tears. It was a moving performance which humbled all who watched and gave us hope. Because the longer Zelensky survives and the more he draws standing ovations from parliaments and wet cheeks from millions watching on TV, the more he becomes Putin’s worst nightmare.

The history student first started feeling unwell in August , but she claims doctors told her she had a blockage in her body. The mum from Essex said: I was on the contraceptive pill. I was taking it every day and even through my pregnancy, I was taking it every day. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here I didnapost really have any symptoms. I was still having periods every month and didnapost have a bump or anything like that. When she first saw a gastroenterologist in October, Ellie claims she had blood tests which didnapost detect any hormones that indicated she was expecting. She recalled: The only reason I started going to the doctors was because I had stomach pain, was really uncomfortable and felt like I was putting on weight. I did a pregnancy test at home and thought aposoh, itaposs negative, it canapost be thatapos and had six doctors say that I wasnapost pregnant.  I went to the doctors and they looked me over, sent me for some blood tests and gave me a pregnancy test while I was there, and it came back negative. They thought it was something to do with my digestive system so I was sent to specialists. All of the easy stuff was being ruled out by tests and they thought it was quite serious and that I basically had a blockage somewhere. She even claims she had an ultrasound scan on  December which didnapost detect anything in her womb - but the following day she realised that wasnapost the case. After going out for dinner to celebrate her grandmotheraposs birthday, Ellie went to bed but woke up hours later with excruciating stomach and back pain.  After throwing up for the next four hours, Ellieaposs mum called an ambulance at am and she was rushed to AE. Ellie recalled: I went for a wee and it felt like all of my lower stomach muscles were just pulling and I thought aposthereaposs something there, thereaposs something going on thataposs not quite rightapos. While on the toilet, Ellie screamed out to the nurse who rushed in to examine her. I said the pain was really bad and worse than it ever had been and they basically pushed me onto my side and her head was born, and that was the first time I knew that I was one, pregnant, and two, in labour, she recalled. Her head came out and the doctors recoiled back from the bed and said aposwe need to get a midweapos and pulled the panic button. At that point I had another pain and she was delivered on the bed behind me.  I didnapost quite believe it. I thought I was hallucinating at that point as well because of the pain and then I had this bundle put next to me and cuddled up with me, and there was a little baby face. And that was the first time I kind of fully believed that this was happening to me. Ellieaposs daughter Alicia was born at .am on  December  weighing lbs oz. Ellie claims she had been taking the contraceptive pill for six years and was advised by doctors that this meant that it wasnapost as effective as it should have been. She was also told it was regulating her hormones, which is why her pregnancy wasnapost detected via tests. Ellie believes her pregnancy wasnapost spotted on the ultrasound because Aliciaaposs back was against her spine, which also explains the excruciating back pain she experienced during labour.  After Ellieaposs friends and family got over the shock, they rushed to her aid to provide the new mum with nappies and baby equipment - seeing as sheaposd not had time to get anything ready for Alicia. Ellie said: Because I was still in that panic mode, my first reaction was aposI canapost be a mum, I canapost do it, please donapost.apos I spent  minutes alone with her and said aposyou know what,my body could have done that, I can do it, itaposs meant to beapos and I just fell in love with her at that point anyway. I rang my friends and they didnapost believe me, so they had to come to the hospital and they all cried. I think I was the only person that didnapost cry, because I was still in a bit of a blur. Now Ellie couldnapost imagine her le without Alicia, who she describes as a whirlwind of energy. She said: Sheaposs an absolute little fighter, she had nothing wrong with her and we joke that she was pickled through the pregnancy.Did you have a surprise miracle baby  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcBut she is incredible, smart and she started walking when she was -months-old.

Imperial College London’s REACT study reveals upturn infections since Boris Johnson ’s ‘Freedom Day’ on February , which included the removal of the legal requirement to self isolate.The , random swab test collected in England between February  and March  suggests one in every  people now have the virus. Covid cases were falling until the final days of February since when they started to increase.  Professor Paul Elliott, director of Imperial’s React programme, said: “We are seeing an uptick in infections, particularly in the older group, and we are seeing an uptick in hospitalisations. “At the moment, we’re possibly seeing the beginning of an uptick, but we don’t know where it’s going to go.” Prevalence in England was .%, down on the .% reported in the last round covering January -, but the second highest recorded rate since the study began in .New cases are being driven by the BA. sub-lineage of Omicron, dubbed ‘Stealth Omicron’ because it cannot be detected by routine PCR tests. Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency , said: “These data confirm that cases have declined substantially following the peak of the Omicron wave. “However, the increasing presence of BA. and the recent slight increase in infections in those over  show that the pandemic is not over and that we can expect to see Covid circulating at high levels.“Vaccination remains the best way to protect us all from severe disease and hospitalisation due to Covid- infection.“We urge you to come forward for your primary or booster doses straight awayyou have not already done so.” There were , new positive tests logged across the UK over the last  hours, according to Government dashboard data, % more than last Wednesday’s figure of ,.

England scrapped all its remaining emergency Covid laws in February with routine contact tracing axed along with £ self-isolation payments. Dr Simon Clarke, cellular microbiologist at Reading University, said: “There’s something of an inevitability to increasing infection numbers. “Control measures were put in place to reduce transmission of the coronavirus, so removing them, by definition, creates an environment where transmission can occur more easily.  “If you create or allow conditions for the virus to spread, that is what it will do. It cannot simply be wished away. “Whether the UK sees the number of hospitalisations like we have seen previously and whether admissions result in a higher proportion of patients going to ICU remains to be seen “This latest increase in infections could be because people are mixing more or because of a drop in population-wide immunity. Most likely it’s a bit of both.” Asked whether the increasing numbers of BA. could lead to a surge in new cases, Prof Elliott added: “It is more transmissible.” The REACT data has been published as a pre-print.

Hours later, they had sex in the car park. One text Harris wrote read: Seems Kayla and … are getting on well, so I am happy to ferry them around.

They had been duped by the boy into the belief he was seeing someone of his own age.”  He went on: “As a teaching assistant at his school shewould have known his age - such activity is a criminal offence regardless of whether he believed himself to be a willing party.” Judge Caroline Wigin sentenced her on Wednesday, saying the womanaposs behaviour was an abuse of trust, constituted grooming and involved signicant planning. She said: Your conduct has had a devastating effect upon the le of that young man. I find that you disregarded all the warnings that you had. Before the sentencing, Julia Flanagan, defending, argued that the messages and trips had not been geared specically towards a sexual relationship. But Judge Wigin cut in, saying sharply: It is utterly inappropriate to form any relationship of any kind. She chose to disregard that. She chose to abuse this trust. The defence barrister added: She bitterly regrets that she became involved withand she wanted me to tell the court that she did not intend to cause him any harm.

In it, they opened up about many members of the Firm - with Harry accusing his dad Prince Charles of cutting him off financially and not taking his calls. Even after the explosive chat, he appeared on the Armchair Expert podcast, where he lashed out at Charlesaposs parenting and talked about total neglect on the Apple TV series The Me You Canapost See. Later reports claimed that relations between the pair were at rock bottom - but recently there have been signs that Harry, Meghan and Charles could be ready to bury the hatchet. Here we take a look at them... Full of praise  One of the first signs that Harry and Charlesapos relationship could be improving was just a few days into . Charles wrote an essay for Newsweek, where he issued a call for urgent action to save the environment.In the piece, he praised both Prince William and Harry for their work in raising awareness of the issue. He spoke about how he was proud of both of his sons for having recognised the threat of climate change. He said: Most recently, my elder son, William, launched the prestigious Earthshot Prize to incentivise change and help repair our planet over the next ten years by identying and investing in the technologies that can make a dference. And my younger son, Harry, has passionately highlighted the impact of climate change, especially in relation to Africa, and committed his charity to being net-zero.

Shortly after the Newsweek essay was released, the Mirror revealed that Charles had held several “good-natured and enjoyable” video calls with Harry. Sources close to Charles said that despite reports of the two not speaking, Charles and Harry have been on “a journey of rediscovery” in terms of their relationship. One said: “The Prince of Wales has spoken to his son frequently in recent months. He loves him very much, as he does both his children, and he looks forward to them being able to spend time together in the near future.” Regular contact And it seems these video calls might not be a one-off for Harry and Charles and itaposs been suggested they talk regularly.Thataposs because, writing in the , royal expert Camilla Tominey claims that Prince Charles is thought to be in regular contact with his youngest son.However, she added: Whether Meghan will everto the UK remains to be seen. Olive branch invitation Meanwhile, it has also been reported that Charles offered his son an olive branch by offering him an invitation to stay with him the next time he brings his family to the UK.The offer of bringing the family together for the first time since Harry and Meghan decided to quit their royal roles and set up home in Calornia was made by the heir in the lead up to Christmas, it is understood. But Charles’s good-natured plan, in an attempt to heal the rt between him and his son, has been thrown into doubt after Harry suggested awould come at “too great a personal risk” due to his security situation. Meghanaposs photo Meanwhile, another sign came on Tuesday when eagle-eyed royal fans spotted a touching photo of Meghan Markle that has pride of place in Charles and the Duchess of Cornwallaposs home.Camilla welcomed three female rowers, who crossed the Atlantic in record time, to Clarence House - the London home she shares with Charles - to mark International Womenaposs Day. They were joined by former male rower Tim Christian and were pictured chatting with Camilla in a sitting room at the royal residence.  Behind where the guests were sitting, royal fans noticed a side table that was filled with lovely family photos. And one of them included a stunning black-and-white image of Meghan with Charles on her wedding day in . When Meghan married Harry, Charles escorted the bride halfway down the aisle of St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor - and the framed photo appears to depict this.

Victoria Cook, , welcomed her son Jack five months ago with him weighing a whopping lbs oz. Despite only having gas and air to get her through, Victoria says she felt very little pain - and really enjoyed the experience.She was in labour for hours in the birthing centre near her home in London last September but it appears she loved every moment of it. The nurses told her how peaceful the process was - despite little Jack being one of the biggest babies of his age in the country when he was born.  Victoria said: I know it sounds ridiculous but it almost didnapost hurt, it was quite a quick delivery. His shoulder got a bit stuck on the way out, which was painful, but on the whole, it was a really positive experience.We opted for a birthing centre instead of a labour ward in the hospital and we were lucky enough to have another water birth. It sounds a bit hippie, but we had nature sounds playing in the background during labour as well, so that was really nice.  Every time we had a nurse come in or anything they would say aposwow itaposs so peaceful in hereapos! Victoria says she would highly recommend a birthing centre to any soon-to-be-mums. She said: Itaposs midwe run, so itaposs less medical than going to a hospital and much more natural. The water birth was so great as well, itaposs such a relief during labour to get into the warm water, it takes the strain off your back as well. We had a lovely corner room as well, so there was lots of sunlight flooding in. Giving birth can be really daunting, and I think we donapost talk about a lot of the details of it enough.  So many people have horror stories, and a traumatic birth experience, so I want people to know itaposs possible to give birth to a lb baby and walk away from it! Victoriaaposs experience was so positive, she even ended up face-timing her mum during labour. She said: I donapost really know what I was thinking, looking back, but at the time it seemed like a great idea. I was doing little video tours of the room and I spoke to my brotheraposs we, Liana, because she was only ten weeks behind me. So I just showed her what was going on. Victoria revealed that she also had a huge bump with Jack and looked nine months pregnant at the seven-month mark. Victoria said: It was just huge. People say with your second you do look bigger, but lots of people were asking meI was having twins.I suppose I was carrying the equivalent of that, roughly. It got to the point where even walking became quite hard.Trying to look after a one-year-old in that state is really dficult. Today, Jack wears the same size nappies as his one-year-old sister Emilie and is powering through her hand-me-downs. Victoria said: When Jack was born he was one of the biggest of his age in the country, he was in the th centile for weight. Because Jack was my second, I was a bit more prepared going to the birthing centre. I had some - month clothes for him to wear because he wouldnapost fit into newborn stuff. One issue we had though, was with nappies because none of the newborn sized ones at the centre fit him.

Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said it was “impossible to make a sensible prediction” about the size of any BA. wave but the situation needed close monitoring.He told the: “The worry is that it’s hard to see anything happening in the next few weeks that will reverse the growth of BA. unless, that is, people decide on their own account to step up precautions.”Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College, said the recent rise was foreseeable. “We’ll see a great deal more of this, along the lines of recent resurgent spikes in Scotland and Hong Kong,” he said. “Caseloads were by no means low or under control as we came out of all mitigations and, when you add in waning immunity and the enhanced transmissibility of BA., it looks like we are in for a dficult period, especially for the elderly.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSDepartment of HealthGrant ShappsHospitalsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She doesnapost need to try to be someone  including Diana. Sheaposs great as she is.” The tweet sparked discussion among royal fans, who were quick to also share their thoughts.One person said: I donapost even think she is trying to be Diana, I donapost see any major similarities to Diana apart from the fact that they are both beautul and kind. The Duchess of Cambridge never tried to be anyone  but herself, wrote another. She has been in the public eye for over  years. A lot longer than that of Diana. The Duchess of Cambridge has made her own mark and done things her own way including creating her adorable family. A third commented: Of course she canapost be compared to Diana. Diana was doing over  appearances every year, and so many tours and she was so young. She had a huge influence on pop culture and her Charity work remains unmatched. So yeah. No comparison. While someone  put: Spot on Angela! Nor is she trying to be anyone . It’s certain people pushing that nonsense.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

The Money Saving Expert founder warned about forthcoming price rises which will impact Brits in the coming months.Martin revealed that the price of stamps and prescriptions will rise from April , the Manchester Evening News reports.First class stamps are going up by p to p, and nd class stamps will now cost p, up by p. Consumer expert Martin issued a useful tip to adults in the UK to help them save money ahead of Christmas. The key rule here is to stock up now on these class stamps i.e those that say first or second. In the past when prices went up Iaposd always say you could use them indefinitely but you can only use these until January , , Martin said.  So buy [these] Christmasapos stamps nowyou can do so. Ordinary stamps are set to be replaced by bar coded stamps from February . Martin also advised that you could still buy the existing stamps now, and then swap them in for the new ones via a free scheme that is going to come later in the year. Butyou are going to use stamps in the future, you may as well buy them in now whilst they are cheap, he added. His advice comes as family finances face being stretched as Ofgemaposs price cap will rise for  million homeowners, with the average household bill increasing by around £ per year.Earlier this week Martin issued a new video with three things everyone must do before prices rise on April . This included checkingyou can stockpile energy now to beat the price hike, taking a meter reading nowyou pay by direct debit and checking how you can claim a £ council tax rebate from April. Keep an eye out for a letter from the council because each council will tell you its claim system and you need to watch for that,” said Martin. If youaposre not eligible for the £, say, because youaposre in a higher band, then there is a discretionary £ million fund being set-up to help those who are struggling. “It will be up to each council to decide how it distributes it, but be ready to claim that.

Yesterday, Camilla welcomed three female rowers, who crossed the Atlantic in record time, to Clarence House - the London home she shares with Charles - to mark International Womenaposs Day. They were joined by former male rower Tim Christian and were pictured chatting with Camilla in a sitting room at the royal residence. Behind where the guests were sitting, royal fans noticed a side table that was filled with lovely family photos.And one of them included a stunning black-and-white image of Meghan with Charles on her wedding day in .  When Meghan married Harry, Charles escorted the bride halfway down the aisle of St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor - and the framed photo appears to depict this.Other framed pictures on the side table appear to be one of Prince Harry at the Invictus Games, an adorable photo of Charles holding Prince George at his christening in  and a family shot taken at Prince Louisapos christening in . Earlier this week a new book claimed Meghan showed she was confident and independent and certainly not a blushing bride on her wedding day.

With her father unable to attend the wedding, Charles offered to walk her down the aisle of St George’s Chapel.Her reply was not quite what he expected: Can we meet halfway , she asked, according to a new biography of The Queen by Robert Hardman, serialised in the Daily Mail. The response was an indicator that this was no blushing bride, but a confident, independent woman determined to make a grand entrance on her own, the author notes.  Meghan has yet toto the UK since she and Harry quit as senior royals in early , and son Archie has also not been back for a visit. Meanwhile, Harry and Meghanaposs baby daughter Lilibet has never been to the UK or met her grandfather Charles or great-grandmother the Queen.Earlier this year, Charles is said to have offered an olive branch to his son by inviting him and his family to stay with him on their next trip over from America.He has expressed his firm wish to spend quality time with his grandchildren in an attempt to heal the rt between him and his son. Royal sources confirmed the Prince of Wales has held several “good-natured and enjoyable” video calls with his son, Meghan and the children during the past few months. One source said: “The Prince of Wales has been saddened that he hasn’t had the opportunity to spend time with his grandchildren, which he really does miss. “He is a fantastic grandfather and loves playing the role immensely and it’s certainly fair to say he feels there is something missing from his le without the ability to get to know Harry’s children.

An official report said Mr Pitt died aged  after falling victim to a huge Covid outbreak at the prison near South Cave on the outskirts of Hull.Mr Pitt died of Covid- on March , , aged .Hull Live reports that Mr Pitt, who was a serial criminal with a history of violence, had served almost eight years more than his original sentence after he was jailed for attacking a former partner.A judge had described him as an obvious and gross continuing danger to the public. Mr Pittaposs partner had been tied up naked and threw herself ft from a window to escape him when he attacked her out of the blue at their home in Northumberland, trying to gouge her eyes out and threatening to cut her throat with scissors.  In July , Mr Pitt was given a minimum four-and-a half year imprisonment for public protectionsentence for  imprisonment. He was moved to HMP Humber in . An independent investigation by the Prisons and Probations Ombudsman has found that Mr Pitt caught the disease in the prison during a apossignicant outbreakapos in February and March . The ombudsman said she was concerned that when Mr Pitt tested positive for Covid-, healthcare staff did not take his clinical observations and he was not monitored to seehe became symptomatic. Mr Pitt was obese, which meant that he was at a higher risk of developing complications, and should have been closely monitored and his observations taken regularly, the report says. Mr Pitt complained about being unwell on March  but was told by a nurse to sit down to improve his breathing. The nurse then said they wouldto check on him later. But the report said Mr Pittaposs condition and risk “should have prompted an urgent clinical response. The nurse did notfor over an hour, by which time Mr Pitt had got into bed because he felt so unwell, and then an ambulance was called”.  At hospital, Mr Pitt’s health deteriorated, and he was admitted to intensive care unit where he was put on a ventilator. He died almost three weeks later. The report said there were also concerns Mr Pitt’s diabetes was not monitored regularly and there were no follow up checks or reviews documented in his clinical record. Mr Pitt had a violent le along with an extensive criminal record, including numerous counts of assault, criminal damage, and drug dealing. The report said he was the sixth prisoner at HMP Humber to die since March , with one more having died since. Of the other deaths, one was drug-related, two were self-inflicted and three were from Covid-. Jailing him in , Mr Justice Openshaw described Mr Pitt’s criminal record as “appalling”, Chronicle Live reported. He added: “In my judgement he presents an obvious and gross continuing danger to the public and that danger it seems to me will continue for the foreseeable future. “The terrible suffering sustained by the victim must in my judgement be reflected by the imposition of a substantial sentence.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsPrisonsCrimeNeighbours from hell\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dominique Nicholson had a three week old newborn, Erin, when she was given the heartbreaking news that her severe headaches - which she claims were dismissed for months whilst pregnant - were down to a grade  atypical meningioma brain tumour. The -year-old from Leicester underwent surgery to have % of the mass removed just weeks after giving birth. She was so frightened that she even wrote goodbye letters to her young daughters, Erin, now two, and Freya, now six. The mum-of-two said she was left feeling numb at discovering the real reason behind her severe headaches, but that maternal instinct to watch her daughters grow up kept her determined to survive.After undergoing craniotomy surgery in July , she is now in recovery and has yearly checks. Dominique, who is sharing her story to raise awareness, said: I had headaches when I was pregnant with my first daughter, Freya. So when I had headaches with Erin, I wasnapost concerned, I assumed it was a mix of the stress of having a young child, working, being pregnant and generally tired. I mentioned my headaches to my midwe around five times, but she agreed there was no cause for concern and I assumed once I had given birth they would ease. However, after Dominique gave birth the headaches continued to get worse.  She said: I was emptying the dishwasher and as I bent down, the pressure behind my eyes was intense and I fell to the floor in agony. My head was throbbing and when my husband, David, now , came home we went to the hospital. Dominique, a licensing conveyancer, was sent for a CT scan but couldnapost process the diagnosis. She said: Erin was just three weeks old and I expected to be told it was severe migraines.When the doctor explained it was a mass on the brain, I was in shock and very scared. My first thought was my girls. I had to see my daughters grow up. It was my maternal inner strength that got me through the surgery - my biggest fear was not waking up.Dominique wrote goodbye letters to her daughters before undergoing craniotomy surgery to remove all but a small percentage of the tumour which was wrapped around a major blood vessel. She said: I spent a lot of time sobbing in hospital. I needed to put things in place, so I wrote letters, arranged godparents and thought about things to help Davidsomething went wrong in surgery. I distracted myself as much as I could, preparing things for Dave in case I wasnapost there. Thankfully the surgery was a success and without complications and Dominique was able to go home soon afterwards. A biopsy revealed it was a grade two atypical meningioma. She added: I was diagnosed, operated on and home within seven days. There was a bit left attached to a blood vessel that was too dangerous to move but as I was breastfeeding Erin doctors knew that my recovery would be quicker at home. I needed to be with my family.  Dominique was left with a cm scar across her forehead and down the right-hand side of her face. She said: The scar was so much bigger than I expected and I tried to hide it from my eldest and bought headscarves. The scar was mentally hard to come to terms with and I can still feel the scars now. I also saw a counsellor as it was a lot to deal with. I spent a long time hiding inside when my face was at its worst, but gradually I made little outings to regain my confidence. I consider myself to be so lucky and I am grateful to be alive. I now have annual scans to checkthe tumour has come back. It is worrying to think it may come back and that does cause me a lot of anxietyI get a headache. The married couple have been together for  years and are looking forward to celebrating their -year wedding anniversary later this year.  Now the family are focused on raising as much awareness - and funding - as possible. She said: The Brain Tumour Charity is incredible and I just want to get as much awareness out as possible. I am running  miles to represent the  types of brain tumours that exist. I am very lucky to have been treated so quickly and I donapost like to think about what could have happenedI didnapost. I want to warn everyone - but especially mums and expectant mums not to put their own health last. You know your own body and what is normal andsomething isnapost right push for answers. My headaches were ongoing, I felt sick and I was forgetting things. If that sounds like you, please go to your doctor.

The terraced home in Christchurch, Dorset was listed on the market on Tuesday March . The large living room takes up over half of the downstairs and its main feature is a detailed ceiling painting that depicts angels flying and sitting on clouds. The depiction is bordered with round gold and blue trim with ious patterns.  A bust of a woman stands tall at the back of the room, while gold trimmed patterned chairs and couches are positioned next to the light blue walls. There is a marble coffee table that sits on an old fashioned royal-looking carpet whilst a large gold rimmed mirror hangs on the back wall. Breaking the Roman theme, there is a flat screen TV hung from the wall and a guitar amplier resting on one of the chairs.  Leaving the lavish room, the rest of the house appears to be far more common. The kitchen is of a good size and has a double glass door that leads to the garden. Two of the three bedrooms are of good size and can comfortably accommodate double beds, while the third room could only fit a single bed.  The only bathroom in the property is situated upstairs and has a large bath and a separate shower. In their listing on Rightmove, Goadsby, who are managing the property wrote: A spacious terraced home situated in a popular area being just yards from Two Riversmeet Leisure Centre with its golf course. Christchurch town centre is also easily accessible.  There is a covered entrance porch which has a storage cupboard, a door leads through to the lounge. The lounge is a good size with a front aspect window. A door leads through to the kitchen breakfast room which has ample space for a dining table whilst also having a good range of wall and floor cupboards with working surfaces over... There are  doubles, both having fitted cupboards and Bedroom  is currently used as an office.  The bathroom benefits from a corner bath with separate shower cubicle, pedestal wash hand basin and low level w.c. One social media user saw the unique living room and decided to share it on Reddit: For just £k you can enjoy the wonders of the Sistine Chapel from the comfort of your own living room. The post has over  likes and has been commented on over a dozen times.Reddit users found the living room amusing.@Grumpyandproud said: I was not prepared for that living room. @Keiepse wrote: aposThe lounge is a good size with a front aspect window.aposAmazing that the agent couldnapost think of anything  for the description. @Leftpillz commented: Itaposs a pretty appropriate design given the cityaposs name, Christchurch. @Nicowltan replied: That living room is insane, but Iaposm a big fan of the dog at the back door.@busyphil added: Wow.

A spokesperson for the venue said this could not come at a worse time, as the business is still recovering from the Covid lockdown.He told Nottinghamshire Live: It is just ridiculous. One of them distracted the member of staff by standing at the bar out of sight of the door. He was ordering another drink while the ladies in the group marched their children out, one under each arm, and bundled them into a couple of cars. Then they waited until the last guy exited and shot off. He went on and said: We started the business in , just before Covid hit, and so obviously it is a dficult time. The price of everything is going up massively. We have got wholesale beer increases of nearly p a pint this year to deal with. We are going to try to soak that all up, and we will try and fight all of that and then people are going to do that. It is not very helpful.  He said that while the incident hit the venue from a business perspective, it is the well-being of members of the staff that he is more concerned about. He added: The member of the staff that was on rang the manager and said he was upset and quite exasperated. He had been intimidated by their passive-aggressive behaviour - and he has blamed himself. It is awful because he was doing really well and was training to be in a managerial position. Now he has lost all of his confidence. It is not that it just hurts my pocket, the real problem is that the staff there are nervous now and do not feel comfortable.  The pub owner said that he has worked in the industry for about a decade - but that he has never witnessed anything like it. He added: The children were running around the restaurant, running up to peopleaposs tables, falling over things. And then they have left bowls of food upturned on the floor - I have never seen anything like it in ten years in the industry. It was just like a pack of bears had been in.Inspector Hayley Crawford, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “We are pursuing lines of enquiry following a report that a group of people had attended The White Horse Inn in Barnby Moor, eaten a meal and left without paying.“Officers are making enquiries after the incident was reported to us at around pm yesterday. “To help us with our investigation we are urging anyone with information to please get in touch with us.” It is believed those involved left the area in a white van and a black car.

It comes just weeks after she failed to mark the birthday of one of her other sons - Prince Andrew when he turned another year older.Today, the Royal Family Twitter page posted a picture of a smiling Edward along with the caption: Wishing The Earl of Wessex a very Happy Birthday!. It was accompanied by a birthday day cake emoji.Unlike his older brother Andrew, Edward along with his we Sophie Wessex are working members of the Royal Family and carry out engagements on behalf of the Queen.Meanwhile, Andrew quit public le in  following his disastrous interview on BBC Newsnight, where he talked about his association with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.And last month, he reached an out of court settlement with his accuser Virginia Giuffre in a civil sex claim filed in the US.When he also turned  last month, there were no posts on social media to mark his birthday.

He explained: “The language used in this [settlement] statement is that Prince Andrew will be helping sex trafficking victims. Is this him positioning himself to try and reinvent himself in the eyes of the public  Speaking to friends of his this week - they say he still feels he has a lot to offer public le again. I still believe that he is the only person on the planet that believes that [apart from] possibly Fergie and possibly the Queen.” But despite this, Russell said it was impossible to see how he could have a public role in the future. He added: “He is only , but it is impossible to see how he could have any future. His daughter Princess Eugenie founded and helped run a charity for victims of trafficking.

The driver had dropped off a customer in Marsden, a village near Huddersfield in Yorkshire, and was heavily relying on his navigation system upon turning around. When he ordered his sat nav to take him back in the direction of the A, the machine directed its driver through darkness and down a steep path across the Saddleworth Moor. The path was narrow and littered with sharp rocks, but the persistent driver carried on until his car, a Mercedes Vito, ground to a halt.He reportedly tried in vain to reverse, but eventually gave up and called friends for a lt home. He made sure he walked to an accessible road, first. Bemused locals surveying the scene the next day presumed the vehicle had been stolen then dumped by joyriders. That was until the embarrassed Uber driver then ed and revealed the truth about what had happened.  Local Craig Hannah said it was “amazing” that the driver managed to get that far along the “rough and very steep” track. “Apparently he had been working in the area late on Saturday night and was trying toto base,” she said. “A passenger did say he could drive down the lane even though there was a sign warning that it was unsuitable for vehicles. “If you were local you would know the road is not passable but this guy was clearly out of town and didn’t know.” Craig had heard the driver had become so stuck that he had not been able to get his door open. The back bumper of the driver’s car had been ripped off, he said, with the only way to retrieve it, likely being dragging it back up the hill. Craig said the driver seemed a “really nice guy” who had been left shell shocked by the experience. A less sympathetic local said: ‘We heard the taxi driver was just blindly following his satnav and got stuck. ‘Some people just don’t learn from the old adage – the computer is not always right.’ The Uber driver is reportedly awaiting repair costs, after the vehicle was rescued by a tow truck on Monday.

Clubbers now have the chance to buy a souvenir section of the sticky rug with prices ranging from £ for an A sized piece to £ for a larger, framed piece.Owner Simon Jackson was inspired after hearing a young clubber celebrating his th birthday tell how his parents met at the club and his grandmother had worked there. Now, having been on sale for just a day, it has sold more than  pieces already and raised £, for the local Street Angels charity, which helps homeless people.  Owner Simon Jackson said: It started as a bit of a joke, I had a conversation with a lad celebrating his th and he said his grandmother used to work there and his mother met his father there. There were three generations of the same family celebrating. The mother said aposI remember the carpet, it is the same one apos and I said it probably is.I told her changing the carpet has been on the list of things to do for a few years but things kept getting in the way. They said aposwe should take a piece of it as itaposs part of their family history and a few other people said theyaposd take a piece. We got to thinking how many people have met here and had first kisses, birthdays whatever here. The joke quickly snowballed and Simon - who worked as a DJ in the early s before buying the club in  - decided to cut some pieces and sell them to punters. He added: We knew Street Angels were struggling for money so we thought weaposd try to get some money for them as they donapost get any funding. Sales went live at .pm on Wednesday and by .pm weaposd sold over  pieces. By pm that night weaposd raised over £, for the charity so hopefully we can get a few thousand for them. If weaposd got a couple of hundred quid weaposd have been happy. Itaposs just blown up, we couldnapost cope with the demand. Weaposve had to dig it out of the skip and clean it up to sell the rest of it. The club has been a staple of nightle in the former mill town since  and generations have walked on its infamous carpet for more than  years. Simon added: Itaposs famous for three things being really old, selling drinks for p and the carpet. It doesnapost even look that bad, itaposs just going thin in places. The club has created a grid-like map for anyone interested in buying a piece of the carpet - so they can identy the specic spot they would like. Simon added: It would be greatpeople could buy the spot of the carpet where they had their first kiss or they first met.

But it seems one man on Reddit didnapost get the memo, as he admitted he only recently found out about the special prize-winning eggs - just hours after polishing off a half white, half milk chocolate Creme Egg.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.The student, who posted his story anonymously, confessed he had no idea that the egg was special until he saw an advert for the promotion just a few hours later when he had already eaten the chocolate treat and thrown the foil wrapper in a public bin.He said: I am an international student studying in the UK, and so I don’t really keep up with the ads here. A few months ago, Cadbury released  prize-winning eggs across the country with the chance of winning a range of cash prizes including £, .Long story short, I was scrolling through Instagram today and saw the prize-winning egg that looked identical to the one I ate a couple of hours ago. It then dawned on me. I potentially ate £,. The manaposs blunder has left him facing utter defeat as he comes to terms with the potential jackpot he missed out on, as he added: I don’t actually know what  to say other than utter defeat. I think I have officially hit the lowest point in the short  years of my le. While finding one of the rare Creme Eggs is a dficult task in itself, the chances of actually bagging £, are very slim - as only six of the  winning eggs are actually worth the top prize. The six eggs were hidden in an Asda, Co-op, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and an independent retailer, while a further three eggs worth £, on sale in a Waitrose, One Stop and a Booker shop.  Four eggs worth £, are being sold across Iceland and Booths stores, and there are  eggs with prizes of £, while the rest are scattered throughout participating retailers and are worth £ each. Commenters on the Reddit post were sympathetic to the manaposs plight, but many of them suggested he may be able to salvage his prizehe kept hold of his wrapper. One person claimed: To claim, you simply call a number that’s printed on the tin foil wrapping of the winning egg. While another added: Thataposs irrelevant. Evenyou ate the egg, the code you need is on the wrapper, you donapost need the egg itself. So you enjoyed the chocolate, get the packaging out of the bin and collect your winnings! Unfortunately for the student, he had been eating his egg while out and about - so threw the foil wrapper into a public bin and was unable to retrieve it. However, terms and conditions for the Cadbury Creme Egg hunt state that a picture of you not eating your winning egg may be required via email to prove that youaposre the rightful owner of the winning egg. Prizes must be claimed by June ,  and you’ll have to call a number that is printed on the tin foil wrapping of your winning egg to register your win. Andyou really canapost resist the urge to scoff your winning egg, Cadbury has teamed up with sustainable fashion brand Rua Carlota to create a line of clothing that makes it impossible to actually eat the chocolate treats.

He loves playing with my three-year-old daughter.German shepherds usually live between nine to  years - but those with pituitary dwarfism have a shorter lespan between three and seven years. She added: Rambo still has a lot of le left - he has so much energy.Raising awareness of her dogaposs condition on social media, Jenner set Rambo up with his very own Facebook page -Rambo, the German Shepherd with Pituitary Dwarfism - where she shares updates about his day-to-day le. When I got Rambo in , my intent was to have him go on trail rides with me, said Jenner. When he was six months old, I had him neutered and tested for pituitary dwarfism. Two weeks later, I got confirmation from my vet that he tested positive. I was given three options - put him to sleep, treat the symptoms, or try hormones replacements, which was still in its trial phase and is expensive and not guaranteed to work. I chose to treat his symptoms, none were showing other than hair loss. I took Rambo back to the vet and they did two or three blood tests - the results came back and said he also has hypothyroidism due to the disorder. Weaposve been treating Rambo for years now - he has had a good bit of hair growing back. The vet and the techs who take care of him are amazing and they just absolutely love him. This is the first case of pituitary dwarfism my vet has ever treated. Do you have a dog story to share  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.

The ­desperate families squeezed in, standing, sitting, lying wherever they can, next to their precariously piled ­belongings, packed into the dank underground space they now call home. There’s an air of restlessness, a palpable sense of tension and anxiety. How could there not be And then, completely unexpectedly, something magical happens. Little Amelia – age unknown, but probably, what, seven or eight  – stands up on a chair. She’s wearing a sparkly jumper with stars on it, from HM a few years ago – my friend’s daughter has the same one and still loves it too. Hands clenched together shyly, unbrushed hair pulled back into a ponytail, Amelia plucks up all her courage, opens her mouth and starts to sing Let It Go, from Frozen. And like a spell cast in the movie her song comes from, the Kyiv shelter falls silent. Everyone turns and gives this small blonde scrap of a girl their mesmerised full attention. No one moves. Babies stop crying. This captive audience cannot take their eyes off her, as they listen to her sweet, steady voice, a chink of shining light in the unimaginable ­darkness of Ukraine.She has given these people the gt of focusing on something other than the living nightmare they’re enduring, albeit briefly, and there isn’t a dry eye in the room. Or from any of the millions around the globe who have since watched the video on social media.Despite probably never having heard Ukrainian before, the song is in the universal language of Disney, kids from any country in the world watching it could name that tune in three. In the caption, the woman who posted it explains that Amelia told her she wanted to be “a singer on a grand stage” – an ambition now fulfilled, just not in a way anyone would want. Their poor parents can, at least, try to fight back, but the children of Ukraine are utterly defenceless in this war. Putin is torturing and traumatising these pure, faultless human beings, turning them into orphans. Murdering  of them.  Amelia and the other kids in that shelter, and similar ones across the country. Danya and Mpak, the boys trapped in Calais, denied entry by our callous government because they don’t have the right paperwork. The -year-old who braved a -mile journey to safety alone. Heroic President Volodymyr Zelensky’ s own children – Aleksandra, , and Kiril, age nine – who have targets on their backs. Polina, the girl with the pink hair, and her brother Semyon, both dead. And the many other nameless young casualties.All entirely blameless, innocent children – just like their entirely blameless, innocent mums and dads – frightened for their lives.  Two weeks ago they were moaning about homework, playing with their friends, not eating their vegetables. Now, suddenly plunged into a reality where growing up without their fathers may well be the best case scenario. The least worst of their horrendous options. When Let It Go lyricist Kristen Anderson-Lopez saw Amelia’s rendition, she tweeted: “Dear Little Girl with the beautul voice, my husband and I wrote this song. The way you sing it is like a magic trick that spreads the light in your heart and heals everyone who hears it.” She finished by urging Amelia to “Keep singing!” If only that choice was hers.

The incredible image was released by Ourspace, part of the Chinese National Space Administration.The beautul panoramic shot shows the recent journey taken by the rover, known as Yutu , on the hidden hemisphere of the lunar surface. The lbs solar-powered rover landed atop of the Changapose  lander in January .Its powerful cameras recently detected a “mystery hut” - which transpired to be a rabbit-shaped rock- so went to investigate.When it looked back its tracks were clearly shown in the dust on the surface. A diary entry by the Yutu  team said: “On the moonlit night, the scientists expressed their desire to explore the cornucopia.  “ This task seems simple, and the image shows that the road is smooth. However, after the terrain products are actually generated, the drivers still scratch their heads. “An insurmountable obstacle area lights up the red light for this road, although the range is not large, but it cuts off the way of direct detection. “However, this is not dficult for the experienced Yutu drivers. “It started smoothly, turned perfectly, stopped in time, and the detection was successful. Soon Yutu completed the set detection task and ed safely. The pilots applauded each other and looked forward to the valuable scientic data brought back by the probe.”The Earth only sees one side of the Moon with all six of Nasa’s manned Apollo missions landing on the near side. The far side, sometimes wrongly called the dark side, remained a mystery until the Chinese rover successfully landed and started investigations. Yutu  and the Changapose  lander have both far exceeded their original letimes of around three months and one year respectively. Sara Russell, at the Natural History Museum in London, previously said: “The exploration of the far side is really in its infancy. “It’s like this whole new world to explore. We really have a lot to find out about the far side of the Moon. “It’s really exciting.”  It comes as it was announced Artemis , the first in NASAaposs new generation of Moon missions, has been delayed until May, possibly June. It was due to lt off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida in April but has been put back until the space agency has more data from a full rehearsal. Artemis  will take an uncrewed mission around the Moon and back before future missions land on the lunar surface.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

GHK broke the deadlock to score the first try of the game  minutes into the game, then missed the conversion.Mid Argyll then put together some great attacking plays and earned a penalty just outside the GHK -metre line.Inside centre Coll MacKay stepped up to score Mid Argyll#s first points of the campaign with a glorious conversion.  –  to GHK.GHK went on to score two more tries and one conversion # before disaster struck for Mid Argyll on the stroke of half time and with the score at  –  to GHK, as Wilson hobbled off with suspected knee ligament damage.With Wilson playing out of position in the front row, Mid Argyll had to reshuffle an already patchwork pack with Aaron McAllister moving from the wing to hooker and usual hooker Robbie Herd moving to prop.The new look front row finished off, Daniel Doherty doing well, as they held their own against an experienced opposition pack.Mid Argyll took time to settle into the new system, though, and GHK ran in two more converted tries.Mid Argyll almost produced the perfect reply when fly-half Logan Allen whipped a quick ball out to Gritten who, without actually catching the ball, flicked it on to Innes Patterson.Patterson beat two players and released Ed King-Venables who was caught by the GHK defence just short of the line.GHK ran the ball back up field but some great defensive play from flanker Gordon McLean, Self and MacArthur stopped them on the halfway line.A scrum to Mid Argyll saw scrum-half Calum Patterson pick the ball from the feet of McLean and, noticing a gap in the defence, broke through.He still had two more players to beat before he ran over the whitewash for Mid Argyll#s first try of the season # undoubtedly try of the match. MacKay converted for another two points and the score was  –  GHK.Having played with no subs, fatigue was starting to set in for the Argyll boys and with GHK using their subs they ran in a few more breakaway tries.Towards the end of the game GHK had one last attempt and broke through the Argyll defence, but from nowhere C Patterson found the determination and energy to chase the attacker down and fling out an arm to ankle tap him five metres short of the line and supporting was Lochlain Ellis to compete for the ball and earn Mid Argyll a deserved penalty.The final whistle sounded shortly after and the game finished  - to GHK.Mid Argyll enjoyed great hospitality from hosts GHK and Innes Patterson was awarded man of the match before the long journey home."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 3","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWhatever the rights and wrongs of Putin#s invasion of Ukraine, which has been shocking to witness from afar, one thing has shone through.The courage of the Ukranian people should serve as inspiration to each of us to stand against tyranny, in all its forms.As ever when the powerful invoke conflict, it#s the not-so-powerful and less wealthy who bear the brunt.

years and - years.The results showed that among the early morning group, very few students got adequate sleep.The larksoutperformed owlsin all school subjects and this effect, which increased as students progressed through the school, was most extreme in maths.This outcome, however, was not evident in those having afternoon schooling, and the situation almost reversed in those receiving evening schooling, where students with later chronotypes performed slightly better in languages than the early chronotypes in the same group.Clearly academic performance is influenced by biological iation in daily rhythms, to an extent that has previously been underestimated.The study authors, while conceding that it is impractical to attempt to fully align school timetables to inidual chronotypes, suggest that it may be possible to, for example, progressively delay school start times during adolescence.* Goldin et al.  https:doi.org . s---."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 28 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 4 2 2 2 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWe stray off the beaten track for this week#s featured image.This photograph arrived in our inbox attached to a press release from VisitScotland about two new marketing campaigns focusing on Argyll and the Isles sustainable staycations.Explore Islay and Jura and Destination Helensburgh are two of  recipients to be supported by the £ million Destination and Sector Marketing Fund, administered by VisitScotland as part of the recovery programme on behalf of the Scottish Government.Travel blogger Kay Gillespie # aka The Chaotic Scot # took the image as a selfie while experiencing some of the activities that make Helensburgh and Lomond a great winter destination.

Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy.

Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"cowal gathering set for 2022 return","story":"Nobody could have predicted at the end of the th Cowal Gathering in August  that it would be another three years before the sights and sounds of one of Scotland#s best family days out again would be experienced again.The event will be held from Thursday August  to Saturday August  and will feature a full programme including the World Highland Dancing Championships, the Cowal Pipe Band Championship and the Cowal International Heavy Athletics Championship.Live music fans will be well catered for as The Gig at the Gathering s to rock the Stadium on Cowal Gathering Friday night, before some of Scotland’s best-known traditional bandson Cowal Gathering Saturday to the Live Music Tent.Cowal Gathering chairperson Ronnie Cairns spoke of his excitement that the -year-old gathering will be live this year.#This is the best possible news and I can#t wait to welcome competitors and spectators from across the world through the gates of Dunoon Stadium this August,# he said.#While Cowal’s Virtual Gathering entertained thousands of gathering fans across the globe in  and , there is nothing that compares to the atmosphere of games day.#We’ve waited for three years to gather together again and this year we’re going to make sure we celebrate in style.#Full details of this year’s programme, competition entry and ticket sales will be available over the coming months.Visit www.cowalgathering or email info@cowalgathering for more information."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclist mark beaumont supports dambusters ride","story":"The - and -mile cycling event is raising money for the RAF Benevolent Fund, the RAF’s leading welfare charity.It consists of two elements: a virtual ride on the weekend of May -, and a physical #heritage ride# taking place in Lincolnshire on Saturday May .The event pays tribute to the Dambusters, members of the RAF’s  Squadron who were assembled to bomb three dams in Germany’s Ruhr Valley on the night of May - .It was a risky raid, dropping the revolutionary bouncing bomb at low level, and the cost was high.

and Hogmanay festivals from  until .The new producers are being asked to deliver the traditional aspects of Edinburgh’s Hogmanay celebrations including a ‘signicant midnight moment’, which could include fireworks, drones, lighting, or another major spectacle to ring in the bells.However, they will not have to provide a street party.The tender specication document states: “Whilst previous events have incorporated live music and a large street party, the contractor is not obliged to repeat this format but must propose alternative entertainment that maintains or increases the media and audience impact.”Over the past two years, the Scottish capital’s traditional Hogmanay street party has been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, but normally draws crowds of tens of thousands of people from across the UK and further afield.Historically, Edinburgh’s Christmas and Hogmanay festivals have taken place in the centre of the city at locations such as Princes Street Gardens and St Andrew Square, but in the new specication producers will also be asked to extend the celebrations to other parts of the city outside of the centre, such as light installations at Granton waterfront and Leith.For years, Edinburgh’s Christmas has taken place over a six-week period from around the third weekend in November to around January  and has featured activities including a market, fairground, family attractions and an ice rink.The council now wants to see Christmas celebrations distributed more widely throughout the city centre to avoid overcrowding, and the introduction of alcohol-free times and or areas.The specications were devised in response to the findings of a major independent survey into the future of Edinburgh’s Winter Festivals conducted last year.Edinburgh City Council leader, Adam McVey, said: “Through our citywide conversation with residents, businesses and stakeholders last year, it was clear that there was overwhelming support for the continuation of Christmas and Hogmanay celebrations in the Capital, but with a revised format.“More than , people and  organisations responded to the survey, with % expressing support for a Christmas celebration and % for Hogmanay.“I’m confident that by acting on residents’ feedback, we can remain the home of Hogmanay and ensure our Christmas events, enjoyed by so many across the City, continue in a way that balances residents’ needs and aspirations for how they should look and feel in future.”The tender responses will be used to draw up a shortlist for further consideration, and the council hopes to have a producing partner in place by the summer.For Hogmanay, the successful contractor will be required to “maintain the city’s Hogmanay Festival status as a world class event that promotes the city internationally”.Deputy council leader, Cammy Day, added: “Our winter festivals are internationally renowned and, from our conversation with the city, we were pleased that the majority wanted the capital to keep its place on the world map for Christmas celebrations and as home of Hogmanay.“As well as contributing to the wellbeing of our residents, our winter festivals deliver real economic impact, benefitting tourism, hospitality and leisure sectors in particular.“With these new contracts, we want to continue to provide inclusive, high-quality, festive celebrations, further enhance the city’s reputation and allow the benefits to be shared across our town centres and communities.” "},{"url":null,"title":"zoe-covid-study-uk-government-pulls-funding","story":"Professor Tim Spector said

All the meanings amount to statements of fact rather than expressions of opinion,” the judge added. vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Packham’s barrister Jonathan Price said the articles, videos and tweets were “littered with express references to lies, deceit and fraud and Mr Packham is presented as being at the very heart of the deception” Following Thursday’s judgment, Mr Packham said he had “no choice” but to bring the claim.He said: “Truth and love, and a love of truth, are things we cherish. They give us the ability to proceed, to become better people.“They give us a chance of making a better world. So we must protect them, sometimes at great personal cost. And that is why I have no choice but pursue this course of litigation.“In this case, the three have proactively sought to damage my reputation.“There is a line in the sand and it’s been crossed and I aim to ensure that they and any others who seek to employ such methods cross back again. And stay there.”Mr Justice Johnson later said the three men “do not shy away” from their allegation that Mr Packham “misused his role as a BBC presenter to defraud the public into making charitable donations on the  pretext that tigers had been mistreated by a circus and rescued by a zoo”.The three men defending the claim had said that readers were told to “make upown mind” over some of the claims, with the articles containing a series of questions that highlighted “suspicions”.However, the judge rejected this argument, finding: “The questions that are raised in the articles are devices that convey, in what is intended to be an engaging and emphatic manner, that the claimant has sought to raise charitable donations by telling lies.”During last month’s hearing, Mr Packham’s barrister Jonathan Price said the articles, videos and tweets were “littered with express references to lies, deceit and fraud and Mr Packham is presented as being at the very heart of the deception”.He said: “They attack Mr Packham’s integrity and honesty, and allege serious criminality.”Mr Price told the court some of the articles accused Mr Packham of having an “obvious nastiness” and playing the “Asperger’s victim card”.He continued: “Were this to be true investigative journalism that gathers information in the public interest… it would not contain the degree of venom, bitterness and malice.”However, Mr Wightman, speaking on behalf of the three defendants, told the court they were “happy to robustly defend the truth of our articles and tweets”.He said the articles were a “long-term journalistic investigation” and he was “standing on a mountain of facts” about the allegations.Commments are closed on this article"},{"url":null,"title":"chelsea-fans-accept-decade-trophy-wilderness-long-club-survives  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

It is just because Mr Abramovich is the owner, sanctions are on him and one of his major assets in the UK is Cha Football Club. Therefore, as a result of everything which is going on, the club have been punished.”Silver continued: “They don’t want a fresh revenue stream coming into the club, I’m assuming, which could potentially be syphoned off where.“They want to really give Cha a very tight ship to run. I think the sanctions go to May , which would encompass any potential Champions League final, so we have cut our cloth accordingly.“If we lost three players – like Cesar Azpilicueta, Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen – on free transfers because we couldn’t offer new contracts because of what is going on in Ukraine, well, quite frankly, what is going on in Ukraine is on a dferent level.“It is churlish to kind of even compare the two, so we have got to deal with it and see what happens.“These sanctions aren’t permanent, they are very much for the now. In the last  days since Abramovich said he wants to sell, and I am sure before he publicly announced it, things were being touted.“There could soon be buyers on board and we could be very close to having something to take over the club.“We will be able to continue to the end of the season and see what that brings. What the bigger impact will be on the club, I just don’t think anybody knows.”Thanks for your fantastic support today! 👏 pic ptcMsgvKQ— Cha FCMarch , The CST has called for a swt resolution – and one which has fans at the core.“We have not got huge, unrealistic demands , they just continue from what happened under Mr Abramovich moving forward,” Silver said.“What the Cha Supporters Trust want is to make sure there is a football club moving forward, in whatever guise that may be.”Silver added: “Under Mr Abramovich, for  years, we have lived the dream.

People across the generations put their best foot forward at the city’s Titanic Quarter dressed in neon and glitter to raise money for le-changing dementia support and research.Mervyn Currie, an engineer in the food industry from Glarryford, who lost his mum to dementia cut the ribbon to start the walk.He volunteered to be a steward at the event after witnessing the effects of dementia first hand when he cared for his beloved mum Hannah Currie throughout her journey with the condition.Taking part in Friday’s event was emotional for Mervyn and his mum was never far from his thoughts.“It did bring it all back as you are surrounded by people who have all gone through the same thing but there was a great sense of comradeship too.“Despite all the trials that a single carer experiences, I count that particular role in my le as being the most rewarding of all. It was a privilege and honor and to have God’s blessing and strength.”Hannah’s husband Robert passed away in  and she enjoyed  years of good health, but after a while Mervyn began to notice that she was getting confused from time to time. She was taken to hospital following a fall, where she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.Hannah had always said she wanted to be cared for at home and Meryn was determined to honour her wishes. He juggled caring for her with his full-time job, assisted by a home help and a carers who visited daily.“People would say to me you’re doing a great thing looking after your mother, but to me it was duty that I was happy to do. But I did wish I had another sibling to share it with. I did have an older brother, Robert Samuel Strahan Currie, but he died infancy.“At the start caring for my mother was very, very hard. But I had to come to terms with the fact she had a disease of the mind.It’s like a net curtain comes down and you see you loved one but you can’t really talk to them.”Hannah sadly passed away in , aged .“When she died it was still very dficult,” said Mervyn. I thought because she had Alzheimer’s that I wouldn’t miss her so much, but the loss was still very big as we had drawn so close.“If someone said to me ‘you can have her back but she’ll still have Alzheimer’s’ I’d still want her back.”Those taking part in Friday’s event completed a .km route though Belfast, stepping out to stop dementia in its tracks after a devastating period for those living with the disease. People with dementia have been worst hit during Covid  and Alzheimer’s Society’s services, including the Dementia Connect support line, have been used more than six million times since the start of the pandemic. Two years on, Alzheimer’s Society continues to be flooded with calls from people seeking vital support for their loved ones.Bernadine McCrory, Alzheimer’s Society Country Director for Northern Ireland, said: “Every pound raised through Glow will help Alzheimer’s Society provide vital information and support, improve care, fund research and create lasting change for people affected by the condition.”To find out more about Alzheimer’s Society’s fundraising events, go to www.alzheimers.org.uk "},{"url":null,"title":"eco friendly alternatives seven everyday household items you can easily replace","story":"Smiles better: durable and reusable bamboo toothbrushesGetty Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSmiles better: durable and reusable bamboo toothbrushesClaire McNeillyTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailFrom plastic free toothbrushes to reusable makeup remover pads, there’s an easier way to make eco-friendly choices in your home.And now that the focus is on going green and becoming a more conscious shopper, many local consumers are trying to decide what to swap, change and consider when it comes to being more eco-friendly.Making the sht to a more sustainable household isn’t as much of a daunting task as it seems, according to UK-based online retailer OnBuy which has provided the Belfastwith some examples of simple and effective everyday swaps for your home. rolls of Plastic free Eco Three ply toilet roll: £.

They received the full award. So, from April  to the end of October, there will be a feasibility study into cricket clubs tackling climate action, a training course for cricket club ground staff on best practice and a Youth Climate Leaders Programme to show how they can make a dference.“Sport may not be the most important reason to tackle climate change but it does provide us with a glimpse of how things are changing worldwide,” says McCartney, who comes from a rural area. “Here in the North West we have witnessed the impact of flooding first-hand in recent years and the number of cricket grounds and matches affected. “Our new project will look to support clubs becoming more energy efficient, reduce costs and train our ground staff in new technologies such as hybrid pitches. “The Youth Climate Leaders Programme will help our Junior Warriors players make small dferences and positive changes andwe can reduce our carbon footprint as a sport then it’s a step in the right direction.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up A consultant is being employed to do the feasibility study which will mostly involve grounds keeping.

Ultimately, though, I think one of the simplest changes we can all make is to buy less and reuse more.“Before shopping in the sales, let’s ask ourselves whether we really need it.

Create a ‘reuse bin’You may already have separate bins for rubbish and recycling, but Moate stresses that lots of our recycling can be reused before we get rid of it. “Why not start a reuse bin ” she suggests. “This can be a place to put clean recycled materials that can be used again for things like arts and crafts.”. Become a water collectorMoate points out that in some parts of the world, fresh water is considered a luxury and a precious resource. “To help us conserve water, encourage kids to collect rainwater in old containers and use it to water the garden or house plants.”. Go on a rubbish rambleGrab a pair of gloves and a bucket, and go on a rubbish ramble, suggests Moate. “When litter ends up in our natural ecosystems it can be harmful to wildle and can take hundreds of years to break down,” she says. “We can do our bit by helping clean up our local environment when we’re out and about.”. Open your own bee caféBees will travel up to two miles in search of flowers loaded with nectar and pollen for food, explains Moate.“Over the years, we’ve destroyed a lot of our native wildflower habitats and this makes searching for food pretty exhausting for our pollinator buddies,” she says. “We can help them out by planting a bee café to help them refuel. A bee cafe is a one-pot stop for our pollinator friends no matter where you live.”Wildflowers bees enjoy include cornflowers, viper’s bugloss, poppies and dandelion, and Moate adds: “I really love bees, so planting wildflowers not only encouraged pollinators but also made my garden more exciting.”. Craft your own recycled paperYou’ll need: old paper, a bowl, water, tea towel and a rolling pin.How to do it: Get some recycled paper and tear it into tiny pieces, and then mix the pieces of paper with some water in a bowl, and squish it all together until it’s really mushy. Squeeze the mushy mixture into balls of pulp, and place each pulp ball on a flat surface and put a tea towel over the top, before using a rolling pin to flatten it and squeeze out the excess water. Leave the pulp to dry and you’ve made your own paper!. Construct a compost bin“Composting at home is great because it reduces the amount of food waste we send to landfills, which create huge amounts of greenhouse gas,” says Moate. “You don’t need to have a garden to start composting either, you can make a mini-compost bin in something as small as a plastic bottle.”You’ll need: an old plastic bottle, scissors, a pin, tray, brown green waste, a spray water bottle and kitchen towel.How to do it: Wash an old plastic bottle and peel off any labels, then ask a grown-up to help you cut the top off the bottle and use a pin to poke some holes in the bottom for drainage. Place the bottle on a plastic tray and add a layer of brown waste – like shredded paper, torn-up egg cartons and crunchy old leaves. Spray the brown layer with water till it’s damp, but not too soggy, and then add a layer of green waste – like vegetables, food scraps and grass cuttings. Place the tray and composter somewhere warm like a sunny windowsill, and give it a stir every day and add a little more water to help micro-organisms break the contents down into compost.Lay a sheet of kitchen towel over the top to keep it damp, and continue to add layers of brown and green waste, but remember it will take time for everything to decompose. When the layers have transformed into compost, you can add it to the soil around plants to give them a healthy snack packed with nutrients.Stuff: Eco-Stories of Everyday Stuff by Maddie Moate, Puffin, £..

In the second half of the century, the amount of change that occurs will depend strongly on how successful we are in reducing greenhouse gas emissions globally.Annual temperatures in Northern Ireland are projected to rise by approximately .°C by the s from a - baseline average. Risks associated with rising temperatures, such as more extreme heatwave events causing impacts on people’s health, are likely to become more prevalent as a result of these projections, with their magnitude depending on the degree of change that is experienced.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up At the time of writing, Northern Ireland remains without a climate bill, although the expectation is that this will soon be resolved. The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , led by Environment Minister Edwin Poots, and Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey have bills that have reached the consideration stage in the Assembly.Whichever bill emerges, it is clear that signicant change to our socio-economic model needs to occur to reach any of the proposed targets. In , Northern Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions were estimated to be . million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Northern Ireland accounted for % of UK greenhouse gas emissions in , compared to approximately % of the UK population. Agriculture , transportand residential buildingswere the largest sectors in terms of emissions. Mindful of the need to address this and maintain a viable economy, Daera has produced a draft green growth strategy which is about creating more green jobs and protecting or re-purposing existing jobs where possible.An important part of the draft green growth strategy is the new energy strategy from the Department for the Economy. It notes an ambition to deliver energy savings of % from buildings and industry by  and meet at least % of electricity consumption from a erse mix of renewable sources by .While the legislation may be edging forward and strategies are emerging, the current Northern Ireland report within the latest UK Climate Change Risk Assessment makes for sobering reading. The Government is required by the Climate Change Act  to conduct such an assessment every five years to inform the UK National Adaptation Plans for England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. The assessment covers  specic risks and opportunities in detail across themes such as infrastructure, health, the natural environment, international dimensions and business and industry.Taking the business and industry theme, issues such as increased flooding of business sites, increased levels of coastal flooding, access to finance, worker productivity and disruption to supply chains could all be at risk from climate change.For example, the annual bill for damage for non-residential properties in Northern Ireland is expected to increase by % by  due to flooding events. The expected annual damages for UK business properties from coastal flooding is expected to increase by % by .The Climate Change Risk Assessment also suggests that there is a risk that access to finance, investment, insurance, and capital for businesses are negatively impacted by climate change through decline in availability and affordability of insurance, a reduction in the value of assets and investment and increased credit risks and cost of capital.Across Northern Ireland, this is currently a medium risk, but it has the potential to rise to high magnitude in future.With these potential risks fast approaching, finding a path to net-zero is crucial. The net-zero carbon roadmap produced for Belfast is enlightening in this regard. Currently, % of Belfast’s emissions come from the domestic housing sector, with transport responsible for % of emissions, public and commercial buildings for % and industry %.Belfast’s roadmap includes an assessment of the potential contribution of approximately  energy-saving or low-carbon measures.I don’t think anyone knows where the money is coming from to pay for these initiatives, but it may be the case that a slowness to act has brought us to the point where we can’t quibble on the cost.Andrew Webb is chief economist at Grant ThorntonMost ReadNI motorists will cross the border ‘in their thousands# for fuel after Republic’s tax cutThe John Hewitt: ‘End of an era’ for well-loved Belfast pub as it gets a new operatorSchools# Cup hockey final: Amy Hunter goal gives Methody the win over Royal School Armagh as heroics #up there# with cricket world recordIntegrated Education Bill passes despite unionist oppositionCost of living crisis: Northern Ireland fuel and heating oil prices soar – weekly increases revealedTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayMethody win Schools# Cup beatingRoyal School Armagh in tense final PlayTwo Ukrainian men defuse bomb with bare hands and a bottle of waterLatest EnvironmentPedal power: Cycling Culcavy mum doing school run on two wheels after ditching carEnvironment In Focus: North West cricketers take on ‘responsibility’ of climate action as sport most vulnerable to changeAsk the expert: What Stormont can do to battle climate change issuesGreen is the new black: the rise of eco funeralsEdwin Poots backs GAA Green Club programmeLatestMarkets slip back as commodity prices reboundCambridge professor left “in limbo” waiting for word on refugee nephew’s visaFirst same-sex couple marry in Chile under new lawStonehaven rail crash: Older trains will be examined for safety – GilruthSteve Rowe: The MS boss departing after almost  years at the retail giant,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAuditor Kieran Donnelly, Credit: .Garrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe NI Audit Office has described the Department for the Economy’s failure to learn from the Renewable Heating Incentivescheme as “completely unacceptable” after highlighting a number of irregularities in its expenditure.Mr Kieran Donnelly, Comptroller and Auditor General , has issued reports on the results of his audits of the - annual report and accounts of the Department for the Economyand Invest NI .The reports summarise his assessment of both sets of accounts, which largely relate to grant support schemes launched in response to the Covid- pandemic.In -, DfE’s net expenditure totalled £. billion, a substantial increase from £. billion in -.INI’s net expenditure also increased by £. million to a total of £ million. This was largely due to the implementation of a number of emergency grant schemes, designed to provide support to businesses and iniduals subject to closure or restrictions.Mr Donnelly’s reports highlight four Covid schemes, totalling £ million, which, although recorded in Invest NI’s accounts, were actually controlled and administered by DfE. These include the Small Business Grant Scheme and the Tourism and Retail Sectors Grant.INI was instructed by the department to include the expenditure within its accounts as it had the correct legal powers to make the payments, whereas the department did not.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Mr Donnelly concluded that INI had no role in the schemes’ design or delivery and that the schemes were actually administered by the department, meaning that the expenditure should have been recorded in the DfE’s accounts.It also means that the expenditure was incurred by DfE without the appropriate legal authority. As a result, he has qualied both sets of accounts on the basis that this expenditure was “irregular”.He also concluded that INI’s financial statements did not provide a true and fair view of the substance of the transactions and he has provided an adverse opinion on Invest NI’s accounts on that basis.Both the department and INI were provided with an opportunity to adjust their accounts to resolve the issues identied by the audit. They both declined to do so as they do not agree with the independent opinion of the CAG.This disagreement has, in part, contributed to the lateness of certication and publication of the annual report and accounts of both organisations.Mr Donnelly commented: “My report acknowledges the speed with which these support schemes were designed and delivered.“It is important to stress, though, that the issues I have identied do not merely pertain to technical matters, but to fundamental principles and standards of accounting with which all public bodies should comply.”The report also sets out the CAG’s qualication relating to Covid- business support schemes administered by Invest NI totalling £. million in -.Based on how these schemes were designed, INI relied on self-declarations by applicants as evidence that certain eligibility criteria had been met, with no corroborating evidence. As a result there was “insufficient audit evidence” to confirm that expenditure was regular.These schemes were launched at pace in response to the continued impact of the pandemic on Northern Ireland’s economy.Approval for their implementation was granted by Ministerial Direction, since the Department’s Accounting Officer was unable to provide evidence that these schemes would provide value for money or that there would not be an unacceptably high risk of error or loss of funds.In addition, Mr Donnelly’s report on INI notes “irregular income and expenditure” relating to a £. million loan made in previous years to Glenmore Generation Limited – an anaerobic digestion facility.The Department of Financeconsidered this loan to be irregular, because certain conditions of its approval had not been complied with and further approval had not been sought.Irregularities were also highlighted in relation to a £.m payment to Tourism Ireland Limited, where again DoF approval was not obtained.Commenting on these qualications to the accounts, Mr Donnelly said: “It is completely unacceptable that a Department fails to comply with the requirements of primary legislation it is relying on to make payments.“This is a basic requirement, and it is extremely disappointing to see that the Department has failed to learn lessons from its past failure on obtaining approvals required for the Renewable Heating Incentive scheme.”INI published its - Annual Report  Accounts on Wednesday. They say the accounts have been qualied by the NI Audit Office in two areas – expenditure relating to NI Executive Covid emergency response schemes and expenditure relating to a loan provided for the Glenmore Anaerobic Digestion Facility.Responding to the qualications Mel Chittock, Interim CEO, Invest NI said: “We acknowledge the decision of the Comptroller and Auditor General to qualy our accounts.“The global pandemic was an unprecedented situation which required implementation and operation of emergency schemes outside of normal process.“I am confident that all the necessary steps were taken to provide the best solutions to get much needed emergency funding to businesses. We complied fully with the instructions given to us and NIAO found no irregularities.”Addressing the qualication relating to a loan provided for the Glenmore Anaerobic Digestion Facility in more detail, she said under the Sustainable Utilisation of Poultry LitterScheme INI provided funding towards the build and operation of two anaerobic digestion plants.“The aim was to help resolve a signicant local environmental issue and to help Northern Ireland comply with EU nitrates targets, as well as provide economic benefits by supporting growth in the agri-food sector,” Ms Chittock said.“It was always understood that the development of anaerobic digestion plants using innovative technologies was high risk. This risk was balanced against the environmental and economic benefits to the NI economy.“The Glenmore facility encountered technical and operational dficulties and in  the owner operator decided to refinance the business. As a result, Invest NI, and the main funder, will not receive aon the initial investment made.“However, the plant remains operational, is contributing to the objectives of the SUPL Scheme, and producing green energy for two NI manufacturing businesses.”A review highlighted that there could have been improvements in Invest NI internal processes and that it could have taken more steps to better mitigate and manage the loan investment in this project.However, the Department of Finance concluded that some of the conditions it put in place around the loan were not met, and now views the loan as an irregular spend.INI insists that it has tightened its processes and procedures and formed a new Invest NI Governance Council focussed on implementing best practice and improvements right across the organisation.A DfE spokesperson said as the Covid crisis gripped the country, the department and its arm’sbodies responded immediately, with  schemes delivered at a cost of £m. which helped tens of thousands of local businesses.It is therefore disappointing, and not for the first time, that the Department is forced to clary its position following an NIAO report,” he added.“The Department’s accounts were presented to the NIAO in May , as agreed. A delay arose because of the NIAO’s interpretation of an accounting issue it had not raised the previous year when the same schemes were delivered.Despite obtaining extensive and robust legal advice supporting its approach, the Department was unable to persuade the NIAO of its position a position that was universally accepted and supported across Government.The Department’s Accounting Officer shared his legal opinion and wider supporting documentation with the NIAO in an attempt to agree a consensus. Unfortunately, a resolution to what was, and remains, a subjective issue in accounting terms, prevented the accounts from being laid on time as anticipated.”Most ReadNI motorists will cross the border ‘in their thousands# for fuel after Republic’s tax cutThe John Hewitt: ‘End of an era’ for well-loved Belfast pub as it gets a new operatorSchools# Cup hockey final: Amy Hunter goal gives Methody the win over Royal School Armagh as heroics #up there# with cricket world recordIntegrated Education Bill passes despite unionist oppositionCost of living crisis: Northern Ireland fuel and heating oil prices soar – weekly increases revealedTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayMethody win Schools# Cup beatingRoyal School Armagh in tense final PlayVideo: Brawl breaks out in Belfast city centre during paradeLatest Northern IrelandGrowing pressure on DUP to renominate a first minister to release budget fundsMore than , pledges of rooms for Ukrainian refugees in IrelandMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageStadia funding scheme is ‘crucial for boosting women in football’Liam Neeson: Passing of Integrated Education Bill is great encouragement for NI’s futureLatestSteve Rowe: The MS boss departing after almost  years at the retail giantCha fans would accept decade in ‘trophy wilderness’ as long as club survivesChris Packham says ‘line in the sand’ was crossed with defamatory articlesHow can Ukrainians apply for a visa to come to the UK Royal Cornwall Hospital suspends visits to tackle rising Covid cases,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have taken strides and worked with the clubs and got everyone to a point where for the first time in the  season, we will have professionalismGerard Lawlor, NIFLFootballing officials pointed to signicant strides made in recent years, with large crowds attending matches and more opportunities for coverage on TV.Steven Mills, the chief operating officer at NIFL, said it was important that more women were in leadership roles in the organisation.“We are getting better at giving them a voice and supporting them. There’s certainly more work to be done,” he said.Mr Lawlor said a key milestone will be reached next year when, for the first time, female footballers in Northern Ireland will be afforded professional status.“So currently women are not able to earn a living from football in this country,” he said.“We have taken strides and worked with the clubs and got everyone to a point where for the first time in the  season, we will have professionalism.”He said five of the main Northern Ireland clubs have a ladies’ section, while others are affiliated to a ladies’ team.At the same committee later on Thursday morning, the Irish Football Associationsaid the ladies’ game is the fastest growing part of the sport.More than , people are expected to gather in Windsor Park next month when the Northern Ireland team plays England in April as part of the World Cup qualying campaign.“I think there’s a cultural element toowe changed from  supporters to , or more. Clearly, the mindset has changed. Women are a part of football more than they have ever been before. And everybody recognises that,” IFA chief executive Patrick Nelson said.IFA president Conrad Kirkwood said female referees are now operating at a high level within football in Northern Ireland.It is no longer a “novel” sight, he said, and women referees are judged on their performance, not on their gender.Angela Platt, who was appointed the director of women’s football in the IFA last year, said she believed that funding was secure for some of the key programmes encouraging participation in sport among young women.“It’s my job to ensure that the continued investment in those programmes continues beyond its current le cycle,” she told the committee.Most ReadNI motorists will cross the border ‘in their thousands# for fuel after Republic’s tax cutThe John Hewitt: ‘End of an era’ for well-loved Belfast pub as it gets a new operatorSchools# Cup hockey final: Amy Hunter goal gives Methody the win over Royal School Armagh as heroics #up there# with cricket world recordIntegrated Education Bill passes despite unionist oppositionCost of living crisis: Northern Ireland fuel and heating oil prices soar – weekly increases revealedTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayMethody win Schools# Cup beatingRoyal School Armagh in tense final PlayVideo: Brawl breaks out in Belfast city centre during paradeLatest Northern IrelandGrowing pressure on DUP to renominate a first minister to release budget fundsMore than , pledges of rooms for Ukrainian refugees in IrelandMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageLiam Neeson: Passing of Integrated Education Bill is great encouragement for NI’s futureCommunities minister Deirdre Hargey accused of ‘failing football’ over stadia funding schemeLatestStonehaven rail crash: Older trains will be examined for safety – GilruthSteve Rowe: The MS boss departing after almost  years at the retail giantCha fans would accept decade in ‘trophy wilderness’ as long as club survivesChris Packham says ‘line in the sand’ was crossed with defamatory articlesHow can Ukrainians apply for a visa to come to the UK ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The festival was last held in .Cllr Hanna said that while it was disappointing that this yearrsquos event would not be going ahead, a number of suggestions for an alternative festival had been made. He asked that that all Mournes area councillors are consulted before anything is agreed for this summer in Newcastle.ldquoThere is a substantial amount of money available and Mournes councillors should have a massive say in what happens in Newcastle this year, he added, with his suggestion backed by Cllr Leeanne McEvoy.Cllr Owen proposed that a firm commitment should be made to include the Festival of Flight in the councilrsquos events calendar for next year.She said she had been contacted by a number of business owners and aviation enthusiasts who were concerned that this yearrsquos festival had been cancelled and hoped that it will proceed next summer.Council deputy chief executive Dorinnia Carville said it would be would be premature to determine the events programme for   ahead of finding out how much it would cost.The council official said the organisation had to go through the rates process each year and look at budgets thereafter.Several weeks ago, it was confirmed that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight would not go ahead due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the coronavirus pandemic.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and was also grounded in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Down on the Farm book shows importance of museum collections detailing rich history  ","story":"lsquoI SAW the man jump out of the group and grasp the handles of the plough.

While museums are about objects, those objects have no signicance without people.People make things for particular purposes they use them, they value them, they discard them, they contemplate them. Museums try to understand objects in order to reach the peoplebehind them, understand their lives and so add meaning to our own.Local museums are concerned with all aspects of their communities. Their collections represent the inheritance, the culture, and the trust of their communities.Down County Museum has the largest collection of objects relating to farming in Ulster outside the national museums.Through the generosity of iniduals and families it has acquired not only the complete equipment of two of the last horse-powered farms in the county but a fine example of an early Ferguson tractor, with an invention which not only revolutionised agriculture but brought recognition to its County Down inventor throughout the world.A host of other items represent the history of a basic industry and developing way of le in County Down, from a wooden plough from Mourne to a donkey-powered milk churn from Ballyroney to the first reaper and binder in the area, to hay sweeps, rakes and potato diggers, scythes, rope twisters, turnip cutters, barn fans, churns, butter pats, sheep shears, horse harness, slipes, carts, Young Farmersrsquo Club trophies and records, and valuable medals given for agricultural improvements on the iable soils of County Down.We should not forget that we build on what has gone before and that is as true of our most important industry as of any other.One object which is almost entirely forgotten was the block-wheeled car, with solid wooden wheels, which was the ubiquitous load carrier before the introduction of the large-wheeled lsquoScotch cartrsquo in the s.The agricultural census of  recorded  of these lsquocarsrsquo in the  townlands of the south Ards alone.

","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest secured their spot in the semi-final stages of the Harry Clarke Cup after they dramatically defeated a favoured Ardglass side on Saturday.Despite trailing by two goals with less than five minutes left on the clock, Forest managed to force extra-time, and then penalties, following a bizarre conclusion to the  minutes that ended with a red card and a fairytale finish.Sean Dornan was the hero between the sticks in the shootout after saving two separate Ardglass efforts while converting his chance from the spot for good measure.To add further to the drama, Dornan was initially outfield for Forest before swapping positions with lsquokeeper Brian McVeigh a minute before the final whistle of extra-time sounded.It was a sunny yet bitterly cold Ardglass venue but that didnrsquot deter things from immediately heating up on the pitch as both teams sought to gain the upper hand early.However, it was the home side who would take the lead within the opening ten minutes when striker Michael Magee struck the ball into the net from close range.This lead would be short-lived as the visitors penned Ardglass back into their own half and soon Castlewellan were rewarded for their relentless attacking.A quickly played pass across the box was met by Forest forward Shane Mooney, who made no mistake with his right footed finish beyond the outstretched arms of Ardglass custodian Mark Armstrong.Chances followed for the visitors, including a Sean Dornan effort that cracked the outside of the post from range and an opportunity for striker Scott Kinley, which quickly diminished after he took too much time on the ball.However, Ardglass refused to be bullied for a prolonged period of time from a side a ision below in the Newcastle League and often launched some dangerous looking counterattacks.One such breakaway ended with Shane Teggart earning his Ardglass side a corner which led to a goalmouth scramble before the ball was headed off the line and away from danger.Ardglass began to find their feet and found more success up front thanks to the probing runs of marksman Magee, who was giving the Castlewellan defence plenty to think about.The Ardglass number nine was unfortunate to see his free-kick effort saved at the second time of asking, but he did give his side the chance to go in front when his nty footwork inside the Forest box resulted in a mistimed tackle and a penalty awarded.Stephen Deegan stepped up a coolly dispatched the spot kick, sending Castlewellan custodian Brian McVeigh the opposite direction in the process.Castlewellan continued to battle with Donagh Steele in the middle of the park having a particularly notable performance as he chased down every loose ball available.Despite their good work, Forest may count themselves fortunate not to go into the break further behind as the usually clinical Magee fluffed his lines from ten yards, missing a golden opportunity for Ardglass.The drama of the first half carried onto the second and in a matter of minutes the referee was forced to make another potentially game changing decision.Once again, the hosts released Magee into the danger area although this time he had Castlewellan captain Aidan Dornan hot on his heels.The move ended with Magee on the ground with his hands in the air appealing for a penalty, however, this time appeals were swtly waved off.The contest quickly turned into a feisty affair as Ardglass looked to overrun their counterparts by sending bodies forward in waves of attacks.Jordan Finnegan saw his snapshot smartly saved by Forest lsquokeeper McVeigh before strike partner Magee saw another one of his efforts tipped wide by the impressive Castlewellan number one.Midway through the half Castlewellan were afforded a seldom opportunity, but Sean Dornan opted to pass when he maybe should have tried his luck at goal instead.Soon after, a punt upfield from the Ardglass defence evaded the heads of the opposition, including lsquokeeper McVeigh, and almost resulted in a rather comedic goal.However, the Castlewellan defence recovered just in the nick of time to avoid any red faces.With  minutes left of the , Ardglass would finally add to their tally after a sumptuous dead ball delivery from Neil Teggart lofted onto the head of team-mate Malachy Crangle, who directed his effort into the net.Castlewellan knew the clock was against them but firmly pushed for a way back into the tie. Rossa McCartan was introduced to the fray off the bench in what proved to be a decisive move from Castlewellan head coach Conall Burns.With a minute of regulation time to go, McCartan danced his way down the line and into the Ardglass box where he was adjudged to be brought down unfairly.Forest striker Mooney converted the penalty to notch his second goal of the match but there was little belief from the surrounding spectators that there would be enough time for another opportunity.In what was seemingly one last throw of the dice, Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick inside their own half and players gathered at the edge of the opposing -yard line waiting for the delivery.However, before the free-kick could be taken, some roughhousing from both sides would end with Ardglass substitute Aidan Watson being shown the red card after he seemingly lost his discipline and kicked out at the opposition.A bizarre series would follow, as the initial free-kick was then brought forward to the -yard line where Watson committed his foul, and from here Castlewellan would take full advantage.Sean Dornan struck his lowly driven effort beneath the jumping Ardglass wall, and goalkeeper Mark Armstrong could only momentarily ert the ball away from goal before the onrushing Callum McCabe would tap-in to draw the sides level.With that, the final whistle of regulation time was blown and extra-time was set to commence.To both sidersquos credit, the intensity of the match remained but neither manufactured any real clear cut chances.Ardglass striker Magee picked up a yellow card but the most notable move of extra-time came from the Castlewellan management, whoopted to swap midfielder Sean Dornan for goalkeeper McVeigh a minute before the penalty shootout.This would prove decisive as Dornan broke Ardglass hearts and saved two penalties, giving his Castlewellan side a memorable victory and place in the last four of the Harry Clarke Cup.Following the dramatic encounter, Dornan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe were low on numbers coming down here and we probably werenrsquot as strong as we could be, he said.ldquoBut the credit has to go to the boys, we worked hard and it worked out for us.ldquoWe went - down but we battled hard, got a penalty and a fluky goal.He added: ldquoThe Harry Clarke Cup is blown wide open, Ardglass was probably the favourites and we knocked them out so itrsquos anyones now.Ardglass: M Armstrong, C Kearney, M Crangle, N Teggart, C OrsquoShea, M Rooney , S Deegan, SP Halpin, M Magee, J Finnegan, S Teggart.Subs: S Dorrian, A Watson, J Deegans, A OrsquoShea.Yellow card: M MageeRed card: A WatsonCastlewellan: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, A Dornan , D Gilmore, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, S Kinley, J Murnin.Subs: C McVeigh, R McCartan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  March 11%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash Work has begun on the first phase of a major agricultural marketing centre for the Downpatrick area.Diggers moved in this week to begin excavating a ten-acre site for a co-operative project which is being seen as essential to the future of the local farming community.A pound, livestock mart will form the first stage of an ambitious scheme by the Downpatrick Co-Operative Marketing Centre, a limited company which has been set up by more than  local farmers.A covered sale yard and ancillary buildings on the Bonecastle Road site are expected to be finished in time for trading to begin by late July.

With that acceptance not forthcoming, the money is no longer guaranteed and a fresh bid for funding will have to be made.ARDGLASS ndash A Government minister has been challenged to sanction the ldquospending of buttons to end more than  years of misery for the residents of an Ardglass housing estate.Ardglass SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said yesterday he has written to Stormont Minster Jeremy Hanley demanding immediate action to solve the problems associated with Mill River adjacent to the villagersquos Seaview housing estate.ldquoI have submitted a full dossier on the history of long delay in resolving this problem, explained Mr Curran.ldquoSince  I have been asking for the culverting of this river.

The gates will be replaced with a perforated double metal gate.Planners say the removal of the ldquobulky rear extension to the existing listed building can only be seen as a betterment to its integrity and intrinsic character ldquo.In addition, they say the demolition proposal does not ldquooffend the essential character of the building with its setting retained and its features of special interest remaining intact and unimpaired.Planners have also stipulated that any proposed demolition work proposed within one metre of the Newcastle Centre shall be carried out by hand and that no power tools must be used to ensure no damage to the existing building.The proposed new leisure complex will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.Itrsquos also understood that the eagerly-awaited new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which enjoys protected status, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Late last year, it was revealed that an economist and team of expert consultants would be appointed to design the new leisure facility, with Newry, Mourne and Down Council adding an additional pound, to its capital programme to help deliver the new complex.The planned investment at the current Newcastle Centre housed in the Annesley Buildings is also a key plank of the local authorityrsquos capital investment programme.Mournes councillor, Laura Devlin, said it was well known that Newcastle ldquoneeds and deserves a fit-for-purpose leisure centre.She said while the local authority has faced many hurdles over recent years in delivering a new leisure complex, all Mournes councillors understand there are no longer any available sites within the town which are of a suitable size to build what is needed.But Cllr Devlin said this could not be used as an excuse, highlighting the need to deliver for the people of town and visitors.ldquoThe council is proceeding with plans for a replacement centre on the current Newcastle Centre site, she continued. ldquoFrom the outset of this process I have said that this must include a pool and that remains my position.ldquoI appreciate there are swimming pools within the district butwe are serious about tourism we need to look at a rainy day offering in Newcastle and I believe that a pool would tick that box, as well as providing a superb facility for our local community.Cllr Devlin said she looks forward to forward to seeing the outline business case and the eagerly-awaited project progressing at long last.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely fashion.Two sites were previously identied for the new centre, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.

The extension of the scheme sends a strong message of the important contribution of the small business sector.Last month, Newry, Mourne and Down Council imposed a .% rates rise to finance its poundm budget, with the hike the second lowest increase of any of the provincersquos  local authorities.Rates are made up of two parts mdash the regional rate and the district rate.The regional rate is set by Stormont and, along with the block grant from the Treasury, pays for the likes of schools, health and roads. The district rate is set by local councils and pays for services that the council is responsible for, such as refuse collection, leisure provision and street cleaning.While councils have the power to set dferent rates increases for households and businesses, this year they have chosen to instead set one percentage increase for both.Domestic and non-domestic rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation of homes and businesses by the combined district and regional rate.Domestic and non-domestic rates are set in terms of the number of pence in each pound of the value of your home business. For instance, in the Newry, Mourne and Down council area, the domestic rate for the   financial year is . pence, while the non-domestic rate will be . pence.Key factors that councils have to take into account when setting their district rate, including cost of living, inflation, the councilrsquos own financial reserves and other income, and the wider economic outlook.Last year, several councils chose to freeze their rates due to the impact of the pandemic, dipping into their reserves to absorb the loss of income. Others chose to raise their rates slightly, however this has meant playing a degree of catch-up this year, when all councils have opted to hike their rates.As a result of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos rates increase, local communities are set to share a poundm funding boost in the new financial year.The organisation said it recognises that communities have been hit hard over the past number of years, outlining plans for poundm of financial assistance grants for community and voluntary organisations.In addition, the local authority will also manage the establishment of the Peace Plus Partnership as well as the submission and delivery of the Peace Plus Local Authority Action Plan worth around poundm.The action plan will provide priority projects on a cross-community basis, resulting in shared and inclusive local services, facilities and spaces and make a ldquosignicant and lasting contribution to peace and reconciliation for the whole community.In addition, pound.m will be invested on a new fleet of over  modern and more efficient vehicles across a range of services including refuse collection, district cleansing and parks and grounds maintenance with the new vehicles expected to arrive before the end of this year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Sense have been at  the core of Páuric’s  development and they have done a lot for us  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman braved the winds and rain last month to walk  miles in aid of the disability charity, Sense.Janine Laverty was inspired to take on Sensersquos Run For challenge to give back to the charity which supports her disabled son.So far Janine has raised an amazing total of over pound, through her challenge, but she is aiming to raise pound, in total.Participants challenged themselves to run or walk a distance of their choosing over the month of February.Janine finished her -mile target on February , completing her challenge with a seaside walk.She undertook the walk to support the charity which has meant so much to her family since her youngest son Paacuteuric, , was born premature and has cerebral palsy, developmental delay and dficulties with his vision.Family and friends have rallied around Janine , joining her on walks and generously donating to Sense.Sense services in Northern Ireland have supported Paacuteuric since he was an infant, providing key interventions such as play therapy, music therapy and guide dog days which boosted his development.Janine also credits Sense with providing some of her most precious family memories support from the charity allowed her to take both her sons swimming at the same time, and the family have attended fun-filled Sense days out to places including Ark Open Farm, Armagh Planetarium and Jungle Northern Ireland.Janine explained: ldquoSense Northern Ireland have been at the core of Paacuteuricrsquos development and they have done an awful lot for us.

Eva felt that No One Is Alone from Into the Woods embodied an important message to all who may be struggling at this time.Eva and her family had to keep the news of her win to themselves until the final wastelevised last weekend.ldquoThe hardest thing to do was have to sit on this for over a week, she said. ldquoIt was a total dream to be on a stage like this, and the realisation that this was actually happening was a dream come true. It was so positively, emotionally overwhelming.Eva, who performs with St Patrickrsquos Choral Society in Downpatrick, had the greatest respect for the talents of her fellow competitors.She joined St Patrickrsquos two years ago to study for A Levels in Music, Drama and English and has always been vocal in her appreciation of how the school has supported her.ldquoThroughout my entire time in school I have always felt supported, and each day has opened new opportunities.Eva paid tribute to her accompanist, Darren Day, who ldquomade the process so much easier and his ability to make her feel at ease.She was also very grateful to the BBC for the opportunity to work with a live string quartet, performed so beautully by the Aria Quartet, as the sound that was created really brought to le her final song.Eva also paid tribute to her singing tutors, Courtney Burns and Adam Darcy, and her teacher, Mrs Celeste McEvoy, who entered her submission to the BBC and was with her at every stage of the competition.Evarsquos singing ability has been nurtured from a tender age. As a very young member of the choir at Holy Family Church in Teconnaught, she listened to family members singing in the choir and was encouraged and supported by singer and guitarist Laura Larkin.As a nine year-old, Eva was in the St Patrickrsquos Choral Societyrsquos production of The Sound of Music in which her brother Ciaran sang The Lonely Goatherd. Her love for musical theatre was born and she later took on ious lead roles.She has a dream of continuing on with musical theatre work after studying it at university and has her eyes set on top roles.ldquoMy favourite roles would be Angelica in Hamilton, Vivian in Legally Blonde and Mrs Lovett in Sweeney Todd, she said. ldquoThese roles were all strong, independent women.Eva has struck up a great working partnership with fellow St Patrickrsquos students Lucien Coole and Edward Gilmore in their busking three-piece, The Thing Is.They have recently been employed at the Downpatrick Artisan Market, and on St Patrickrsquos Day will be providing entertainment in Downpatrick.Eva will also be entertaining the audience at the St Patrickrsquos Centre tonight during Gerry Kellyrsquos interview with Patrick Kielty. She will be singing No One Is Alone. Gerry, Patrick and Eva are all alumni of St Patrickrsquos High School.The BBC School Soloist of the Year  final is available to watch on the BBC iPlayer..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Stunning floats set to bring splash of colour to parade  ","story":"NEXT weekrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick will feature a number of stunning floats based around Irish mythology.Downpatrick Town Committee and Down Community Arts have been busy working on five superbly crafted floats which are set to make a major impact next Thursday and turn heads as the festival parade makes its way through the town.With funding provided by Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, hours of painstaking work will be revealed next week.Philip Campbell, from Down Community Arts and a member of Downpatrick Town Committee, is pleased with the spectacular new floats and hopes that the collaboration which made them possible, will continue for the next few years to create even more stunning pieces of work.Children from a number of Downpatrick primary schools are also involved in the project and itrsquos expected that around  of them dressed in costume will accompany the five floats.This week, the children have been taking part in workshops to help complete the floats and prepare for Thursdayrsquos parade.ldquoA lot of work has gone into preparing for the festival parade and we are delighted with all the support that we have received, said Philip.ldquoThe financial support from the local council and the Arts Council has been major benefit and we have been able to source all the materials that we need locally which has helped support local businesses.Philip said it has been good to involve local primary school children in the project and has thanked them and their teachers for taking part.Work has been continuing to build the floats in the Down Arts Centre with one of the stunning new creations being made in Lurgan, but will be transported to Downpatrick for the big day.ldquoWe have been working on the project since January  with the help of local artist Kieron Back and Rab Galbraith and John Wilson from the Town Committee have played key roles in getting us to where we are today, Philip continued.ldquoThe theme of the floats is Irish mythology and they include the Brown Bull of Ulster, Legananny Dolmen and Manannaacuten mac Lir.

Politically the situation is much more complicated in the eastern part of Ukraine. People in the eastern part of the country are very Russian. But % of the people in the Ukraine donrsquot care about politics and just what a happy, peaceful le.Mr Johnston described the now impractical steps his relatives which have to taken in order to get a visa.ldquoThey would normally have to travel  hours on an overnight train from Mariupol to Kyiv to get a visa granted for travel. In the current situation that is just not possible, he said.ldquoThe only way for people to get out is through the only UK embassy open in Lviv and how are people are meant top get there when they canrsquot leave their own towns without the risk of being bombed Mr Johnston added that he and his we and their children, Liza and Jamie, were frustrated that their family members could be just one plane flight away from safetythey could get the necessary visa, orthat could be waived in the urgent circumstances.He said: ldquoWe are worried aboutthe possibility of Alexander being coned to fight and we are getting reports that landmines have been set around the city.ldquoWhile we are all worried, Iryna has been remarkable throughout all of this and has been really strong but we feel that there is very little we can do.Mr Johnston said that they were in despair of the UKrsquos stance in welcoming Ukrainian refugees but still making them apply for visas.ldquoThe south of Ireland opened up to refugees visa-free which is great but that means we still couldnrsquot bring them to our home as they would be in UK territory.He and his family visited Mariupol for six weeks last summer as it has already proved dficult for his mother-in-law to get a visa to travel to them.ldquoMariupol is such a beautul city.

Teaching, and hence learning, relies on communication, the essential verbal and non-verbal communication between child and teacher cannot take place behind a mask. All those non-verbal cues which teachers use to gauge understanding are being lost.A child’s capacity to express feelings and emotions is being affected by being masked. Some children cannot make eye contact and can’t sleep, clear signs of psychological distress and of course, impacting on their capacity to learn. Referrals to schools’ counselling services have rocketed.How can it be healthy for a child to wear a mask six or seven hours per day How can we justy a measure which has no benefit to children and accept the damage to their education, mental health and social development It is long past the time to end this abuse of our children.Hugh McCarthy, , Newtownabbey——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe TV naturalist is suing three men for libel at the High Court over nine online articles claiming he defrauded people into donating to the charity to rescue the tigers while knowing they were well looked after.The strongly denied allegations, repeated in several tweets and videos, relate to Mr Packham’s involvement with the Wildheart Trust charity, which runs a wildle sanctuary on the Isle of Wight.One of the articles on the website Country Squire Magazine said Mr Packham and his partner had “clearly not been truthful with the British public”, adding: “Money has been raised on the back of their truth-bending and they now need to come clean and tell the truth.”The weblog’s editor Dominic Wightman, writer Nigel Bean and a third defendant, Paul Read, are defending the libel claim.In written arguments, Mr Wightman and Mr Bean previously said: “The statements complained of are serious and would convey a defamatory tendency were they not factual and b***** well true.”At a hearing last month, Mr Justice Johnson was asked to decide how an ordinary reader would understand some of the  articles, videos and tweets in the claim.In a judgment on Thursday, the judge ruled the allegations are defamatory and “amount to statements of fact rather than expressions of opinion”.Mr Justice Johnson said that he “broadly” agreed with Mr Packham’s lawyers over the meaning of each publication.He continued: “The essential meaning of many of them is a iation on the theme that the claimant dishonestly raised funds from the public by stating that tigers had been rescued from a circus where they had been mistreated, whereas in fact, as the claimant knew, the tigers had been well-treated and had been donated by the circus.”.remove“Each of those meanings is defamatory of the claimant at common law. All the meanings amount to statements of fact rather than expressions of opinion,” the judge added. vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Packham’s barrister Jonathan Price said the articles, videos and tweets were “littered with express references to lies, deceit and fraud and Mr Packham is presented as being at the very heart of the deception” Following Thursday’s judgment, Mr Packham said he had “no choice” but to bring the claim.He said: “Truth and love, and a love of truth, are things we cherish. They give us the ability to proceed, to become better people.“They give us a chance of making a better world. So we must protect them, sometimes at great personal cost. And that is why I have no choice but pursue this course of litigation.“In this case, the three have proactively sought to damage my reputation.“There is a line in the sand and it’s been crossed and I aim to ensure that they and any others who seek to employ such methods cross back again. And stay there.”Mr Justice Johnson later said the three men “do not shy away” from their allegation that Mr Packham “misused his role as a BBC presenter to defraud the public into making charitable donations on the  pretext that tigers had been mistreated by a circus and rescued by a zoo”.The three men defending the claim had said that readers were told to “make upown mind” over some of the claims, with the articles containing a series of questions that highlighted “suspicions”.However, the judge rejected this argument, finding: “The questions that are raised in the articles are devices that convey, in what is intended to be an engaging and emphatic manner, that the claimant has sought to raise charitable donations by telling lies.”During last month’s hearing, Mr Packham’s barrister Jonathan Price said the articles, videos and tweets were “littered with express references to lies, deceit and fraud and Mr Packham is presented as being at the very heart of the deception”.He said: “They attack Mr Packham’s integrity and honesty, and allege serious criminality.”Mr Price told the court some of the articles accused Mr Packham of having an “obvious nastiness” and playing the “Asperger’s victim card”.He continued: “Were this to be true investigative journalism that gathers information in the public interest… it would not contain the degree of venom, bitterness and malice.”However, Mr Wightman, speaking on behalf of the three defendants, told the court they were “happy to robustly defend the truth of our articles and tweets”.He said the articles were a “long-term journalistic investigation” and he was “standing on a mountain of facts” about the allegations..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Chris Packham says  uline in the sand u was crossed with defamatory articles article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Russian-Israeli billionaire bought the Blues in  and under his stewardship Cha have gone on to enjoy a period of unprecedented success.However, with all of Abramovich’s UK assets being frozen, the proposed sale of the club is now on hold, although the Government could still facilitate a deal.Cha are not permitted to sell any new tickets to supporters or away fans, but all those sold before March  will be honoured, while the club are also subject to a transfer ban and cannot negotiate new contracts with current players.While the Blues may now be facing a very uncertain future, CST board member Dan Silver believes it is something everyone must quickly come to terms with and look to eventually work through.“Sanctions were always going to be on the cards, ever since warstarted, there has been a lot of clamour in parliament and so on for the oligarchs to be sanctioned, so it is not a surprise,” Silver told the PA news agency.“I think the Government probably carried out due diligence to ensure that there won’t be any kind of potential blowback from all the oligarchs who are being sanctioned because they have got deep pockets and good lawyers, so that was kind of expected.The CST implores the Government to conduct a swt process to minimise the uncertainty over Chas future, for supporters and for supporters to be given a golden share as part of a sale of the club.— Cha Supporters’ Trust⭐️⭐️March , “It is not a Government attack on Cha Football Club, far from it. It is just because Mr Abramovich is the owner, sanctions are on him and one of his major assets in the UK is Cha Football Club. Therefore, as a result of everything which is going on, the club have been punished.”.removeSilver continued: “They don’t want a fresh revenue stream coming into the club, I’m assuming, which could potentially be syphoned off where.“They want to really give Cha a very tight ship to run. I think the sanctions go to May , which would encompass any potential Champions League final, so we have cut our cloth accordingly.“If we lost three players – like Cesar Azpilicueta, Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen – on free transfers because we couldn’t offer new contracts because of what is going on in Ukraine, well, quite frankly, what is going on in Ukraine is on a dferent level.“It is churlish to kind of even compare the two, so we have got to deal with it and see what happens.“These sanctions aren’t permanent, they are very much for the now. In the last  days since Abramovich said he wants to sell, and I am sure before he publicly announced it, things were being touted.“There could soon be buyers on board and we could be very close to having something to take over the club.“We will be able to continue to the end of the season and see what that brings. What the bigger impact will be on the club, I just don’t think anybody knows.”Thanks for your fantastic support today! 👏 pic ptcMsgvKQ— Cha FCMarch , The CST has called for a swt resolution – and one which has fans at the core.“We have not got huge, unrealistic demands , they just continue from what happened under Mr Abramovich moving forward,” Silver said.“What the Cha Supporters Trust want is to make sure there is a football club moving forward, in whatever guise that may be.”Silver added: “Under Mr Abramovich, for  years, we have lived the dream. We have won everything we can – it’s just been an incredible ride. vw,vw,px, px\"“But trophies don’t define my support for Cha, because I’ve been going for  years and had  years of famine.“I don’t imagine theydefine most fans’ support.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMr McKeague, from Dunfermline, Fe, was  when he disappeared in the early hours of September   after a night out in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.He was last seen on CCTV at .am that day, entering a service area behind a Greggs store.Police believe the serviceman, who was stationed at RAF Honington, climbed into a bin which was then tipped into a waste lorry. vw,vw,px, px\"RAF serviceman Corrie McKeague walking along Brentgovel Street in Bury St Edmunds at around .am on September   Bin lorry driver Martyn Thompson told an inquest in Ipswich that he arrived at the service area, which was the first stop on his round, at .am.He said: “I reversed up to do Greggs’ bin and, as I put the handbrake on the vehicle, I looked out of the driver’s window, that’s when I saw another inidual.”He said the man was wearing light-coloured trousers and a pink shirt, leaning against a wall and “looking at a mobile phone, as the screen was illuminated”.“I thought, ‘He’s a smartly-dressed chap, he’s been on a night out’,” Mr Thompson said.He said he got out of the lorry to empty the Greggs bin and then did not see the man again.Mr Thompson said he did not speak to the man.Asked by Peter Taheri, counsel to the inquest,he checked inside the bin before emptying it, Mr Thompson said: “I did check the bin because me and a colleague of mine, we always had this thing with that particular job.“It was over-serviced: Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.“It always had very little in it, two plastic bags.“I would say, ‘What an expletive waste of time’.”He continued: “I checked it. I lted the lid, I can recall what was in there.”Mr Thompson said he looked “far enough to see three clear plastic bags”..removeAskedthere was anyone inside the bin, he replied: “No, there wasn’t.”Mr Taheri askedMr Thompson gave the bin a “good enough kick to rouse anyone inside”, and Mr Thompson replied: “Absolutely, yes.”Askedhe would be surprised to hear that there was “more than kg”in the bin, Mr Thompson replied: “Yes.” vw,vw,px, px\"Police search a landfill site in Milton, Cambridgeshire, for missing RAF gunner Corrie McKeague Mr Taheri asked Mr Thompsonhe stood by his description that there was not much in the bin, to which he replied: “I do.”Lawyer Matthew Holdcroft, for Suffolk Police, told Mr Thompson: “The part of your account we reject is that you looked inside the bin.”Mr Holdcroft said that the time taken for the bin lorry to enter and leave the service area was  seconds.Mr Thompson disagreed with Mr Holdcroft’s suggestion that he “simply didn’t have the time to look in the bin”.Mr Holdcroft suggested to Mr Thompson: “You didn’t take any care whatsoever.”The bin lorry driver replied: “No, I did.”After he finished giving his evidence, Mr Thompson addressed members of Mr McKeague’s family who attended the hearing, including his father Martin McKeague, mother Nicola Urquhart, brothers Darroch and Makeyan, and his girlfriend April Oliver, who discovered she was pregnant with Mr McKeague’s baby daughter after he vanished.Mr Thompson said: “I can’t begin to imagine what you as a family have been going through.“I know in my head your boy wasn’t in that bin that morning, and I take that to the grave.”The inquest earlier heard from Alex Knowles, the bass guitarist in a band that played at a nearby pub and finished at am, who described seeing a man asleep in a shop doorway.Mr McKeague was seen on CCTV, asleep, by the Hughes store for some two hours before he walked to the service area behind Greggs.Mr Knowles said he nudged Mr McKeague with a crutch he was using, to try to wake him, and said in his witness statement that Mr McKeague “lted an arm to wave him away”.He said Mr McKeague appeared to have food containers around him.The inquest continues..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Bin lorry driver saw  usmartly-dressed u man in pink shirt, McKeague inquest told article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityFrom ice cream cone creations to vegan and gluten-free chocolate, I wanted to see which Aldi products are genuinely worth buying and whether the more luxurious, grand designs were good value.I must place a disclaimer here, I am a big fan of simple eggs made with tasty, good quality chocolate.For me, it isnt about novelty designs, chocolate shards spiking out and the price tags to match.So when I took a look at Aldis Easter selection, I decided my mission was to find an egg that looks great but tastes even better.One product that really intrigued me was Dairyfines chocolate ice cream egg- a blonde chocolate and wafer cone topped with a milk chocolate scoop, finished with mini eggs and biscuit crumb, as well as a popping candy cone base.Resembling the popular Cornetto ice cream, I was genuinely amazed by the attention to detail when I reached the end of the cone and discovered chocolate-covered popping candy and milk chocolate.It was a real treat to eat and I think Id have been bouncing off the walls in joy I received this as a kid.The one thing that really struck me about Aldis Easter egg offering was the effective use of recyclable materials, leaving you guilt-free when it comes to packaging. Not even the ice cream egg was covered in excess single-use plastic.The cone tasted almost like Caramac -thats a sweet up your street, this is the egg for you. The dferent combinations of chocolate and salty biscuit crumbs sprinkled on top left my sweet tooth feeling more than satisfied.  With the chocolate ice cream egg, you really have a bit of everything and I think its a worthwhile purchase.Salted caramel Easter eggsThere is one major theme in Aldis Easter egg and chocolate collection for : salted caramel. Some of Aldis salted caramel options, pictured. I recruited a salted caramel expert, otherwise known as my boyfriend, to help review the full salted caramel selection. .removeI thought salted caramel was something that didnt really y in quality - yet some of these eggs really stood out as the best. In my humble opinion, one of the best chocolate eggs from Aldi is the Moser Roth salted caramel egg  with hidden truffles, part of the Free From range.Despite not containing milk, egg, wheat and gluten, it gives out little bursts of salted caramel flavours with every bite and it wasnt overly rich. It would have been easy to eat the whole egg in one sitting, not to mention the tempting truffles hiding inside the box. For serious salted caramel fans, the ChocoChanger salted caramel eggis the choice to go for.From the moment you open the box, a strong aroma of caramel jumps out while the chocolate pops with creamy, salty sweetness.One of the more surprising salted caramel items was the rich, vegan, dark Belgian chocolate office bunnies- you couldnt have too many but one every so often would really hit the spot.Moser Roths luxury egg box from Aldi. If salted caramel is your idea of heaven, Id definitely recommend heading to Aldi for a browse. One of the most delicious chocolate treats from Aldi was the indulgent assortment of hand decorated chocolate eggs  with dferent types of fillings.From dark chocolate orange and speculoos to pistachio and macadamia, these chocolates are definitely ones youll struggle not to eat in one go. The flavours really worked well together - an ideal choice for people who love dferent types of chocolate and something visually appealing. One tasted like sticky toffee pudding while the raspberry chocolate had such delicate berry hints - absolutely perfect.Hazelnut filled eggs and hazelnut chocolate rabbits from Aldi. Now Im not the biggest hazelnut fan but Aldi has played an absolute blinder with this flavour in .Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny  leaves you with no words, just \"Mmmm\". Adorned with a cute green bow and bunny charm, the bunny looked great and tasted even better than you could expect.The smooth chocolate melts in your mouth while the hazelnut really hits the spot. If you love Ferrero Rocher, you need to try Aldis mouthwatering crispy hazelnut luxury filled eggs .A mix between Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, these chocolate eggs have a biscuity yet smooth texture with a gorgeous nutty aftertaste. Meanwhile, the Moser Roth Belgian milk and dark chocolate almond eggwas something unique, featuring salted almond butter.The combination of sweet yet salty almond butter with two types of chocolate was well balanced - though it did have a strong aftertaste, meaning its not one for those who can take or leave almond.There was just one Easter egg which left me wanting a little bit more than I got: the Dairyfine Chunky Egg Fruit and Nut .This chocolate egg is described as a thick Belgian milk chocolate egg packed with fruit and nut pieces - a combination Ive been known to enjoy.The chocolate didnt taste as special while the nuts were rather small and didnt have the crunch I yearned for. Saying that, it might be down to personal choice and you could completely disagree.The verdict: Which Aldi chocolate Easter eggs are worth buying From the selection I tried, there are three clear winners: Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny, Moser Roths Free From salted caramel egg with hidden truffles and the Dairyfine chocolate ice cream egg.You can browse the full Easter egg collection from Aldi via the website hereThe Aldi website has even more eggs on offer - featuring cookies and cream, Eton mess and chocolate orange flavours"},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/national/uk-today/19977191.aldi-lidl-middle-aisles-thursday/res","title":"aldi lidl middle aisles thursday","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

The findings by the National Institute of Economic and Social Researchpredict that all regions in the UK will see extreme poverty rise by more than % in the coming year. According to the BBC, poverty levels in Northern Ireland are estimated to rise by a staggering % in the year ahead, bringing ‘the total number of destitute households to about ,.’ OFTEC, the trade association for the liquid fuel industry, is offering households advice on how to keep homes warm and costs low: Only heat the rooms you are using. Turn down inidual radiators in rooms you are not using to save money. If you have thermostatic radiator valves these can be lowered to number one for low background heating. Also, in the rooms you use regularly, ensure radiators are not blocked with furniture as this reduces their effectiveness. The temperature in hallways and bedrooms should be cooler, ideally between  –  degC for persons in good health. Turn the thermostat down by one degree. You can reduce your heating bill by up to % by lowering your room temperature by just one degree.  Identy the benefits available to you: The Government has introduced financial help including the Winter Fuel Payment. Those eligible could receive between pound and pound to help with heating bills. The deadline to make a claim for winter  to  is  March . Search NI Direct for further information. Energy Efficiency Upgrade: Check with your local councilyou qualy for the Affordable Warmth Scheme that aims to assist those in fuel poverty with boiler replacements upgrades and insulation measures. In addition, you can review the many grants that are available for energy upgrades as part of the NI Sustainable Energy Programme – this info can be found on the Utility Regulator’ website. Any energy efficiency improvement will reduce heat loss and save you money. Speak with your energy provider. Always speak with your distributor and agree a payment plan for your energy needs. We would always recommend you use a Member of the NI Oil Federation as their members have signed up to the Consumer Council’s Customer Charter which gives consumers a vehicle for redress should an issue arise. OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings said: “Living in a cold home can be both physically and mentally harmful. No one should have to decide between eating or staying warm, but that is the reality that many are now having to choose between. “We would urge the Government to consider that these are choices currently being faced, as the Decarbonising Heat Consultation approaches.  will be a decisive year that will outline how people will heat their homes going forward in efforts to reach net zero targets by . “Both the Republic of Ireland and England have actioned plans for decarbonising this sector already. Northern Ireland has the benefit of being in a position that allows us to review and reflect on these approaches. “In ROI, the Government are offering a grant of up to  per cent of a deep retrofit, however the average cost is €,, which leaves a large bill for the homeowner to finance, and we don’t see how the savings offered will cover the remaining payments. Similarly, England has offered a pound grant towards an air-source heat pump, however the total bill is expected to be between pound, and pound,. “At a time when households are feeling the pressures of rising costs, it would be unrealistic for the Northern Ireland Government to expect a similar approach to incentivise households to decarbonise. “Heat pumps and retrofitting will be the right choice for many living in a thermally efficient or recently built house, but for those facing financial dficulties and living in an older, colder home, there must be options considered that won’t leave them behind on the road to net zero. “Heating oil is currently used in over , homes in Northern Ireland. A recent analysis by the AECOM engineering company showed that biofuels in home heating could achieve similar emission reductions to retrofitting, but at a much lower cost. The current biofuel being touted as the replacement for kerosene is Hydrotreated Vegetable Oilthat offers an immediate c.% reduction in carbon emissions. “Our message to local Government would be to examine every option available, and to keep low carbon options and no regret pathways on the new Assemblys agenda when considering the heating consultation later this year. A one size fits all approach must be avoided.” For more information, visit https:www.oftec.org   addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eeaadcbbf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_acfaee   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
