Could be you? Data shows that raffle draw prizes are the big ones that people are most likely to not to claim - and can be worth up to £1mA spokesman said: \u0027With such frequent raffle prizes available to be won, we would expect the proportion of unclaimed prizes to reflect this.\u0027Winners have a number of reasons for not coming forward including being on holiday or forgetting to check their ticket.\u0027Some people are habitual checkers and prefer to check their tickets once a fortnight or once a month, and some are occasional players so might not play regular numbers and not be as much in a pattern to check.\u0027 Rules state winners have 180 days to collect a prize – or it is siphoned into its National Lottery Good Causes fund.Camelot has a section on its website breaking down what prizes are outstanding on which games so players can check tickets.It told This is Money that it doesn\u0027t break down the amount that went unclaimed last year per game, so it is not clear how much is unclaimed on scratchcards, for example.          Scratchcards: Many people win small prizes - and may forget about claimingThe figures are for the 201718 financial year, ending 31 March 2018. The firm says it publicises all prizes of £50,000 and above saying it releases to local media the area where an unclaimed ticket has been bought approximately two weeks after the draw to raise awareness and also publishes this on its website.It adds that it undertakes activity in those areas tailored to the prize and location.It says: \u0027Examples of previous activity include working with football clubs such as PA announcements at half time, advertorials in match day programmes, working with relevant local third parties\u0027 social media channels, information targeted at commuters at relevant transport hubs as well as more traditional PR activity designed to drive media coverage.\u0027We also undertake radio interviews to drive awareness. We\u0027re delighted to say we have had lots of examples of winners who have seen media coverage or heard a radio interview and come forward as a result.\u0027So what about if you find a ticket after that 180 day period? Would you have any chance of claiming your prize?Under the rules for playing National Lottery games agreed with regulator, the Gambling Commission, players have 180 days to claim their prize.If players contact it - either by calling the National Lottery Line or by emailing - before the end of the 180-day claim period to notify that they intend to claim their prize, they must make their claim in person within seven days of the end of the 180-day claim period.A spokesman added: \u0027We also offer a service for anyone who believes they have a genuine claim but is no longer in possession of their ticket because it has been lost, destroyed or stolen.\u0027In these circumstances, players must contact us in writing within 30 days of the draw in question to make a claim.\u0027Based on the information provided by the claimant, we, may at our discretion, investigate and consider the validity of the claim.\u0027If we are satisfied that the claim is valid, we may, at our further discretion, pay the prize after the end of the 180-day claim period for that draw.\u0027Some examples of huge prizes that went unclaimed include a £65million EuroMillions jackpot in 2012, with the ticket bought in the Stevenage and Hitchin region of Hertfordshire.In 2007, a ticket bought in Devon for the Euromillions won £6.9million but that went unclaimed – as did a £9.4million Lotto jackpot from a ticket purchased in Doncaster in 2005.And in 2006, the Lotto jackpot was won by two tickets, splitting 3.3million between them. One ticket was bought in Glasgow and the other in Warwickshire – and neither stepped forward to claim the prize.Unclaimed prizes end up going to a good causes fund. To date, £38billion has headed to 535,000 projects across Britain, a small portion of which has been from unclaimed wins. The decision on how and where funding is invested is made by 12 specialist organisations. These are chosen by Parliament for their knowledge and expertise to help ensure the money goes where it is needed.In the year ending 31 March 2018, 40 per cent of funds went to health, education, environmental and charitable causes, while 20 per cent went to sports, arts and heritage. £185 M\u0026S vouchers to switch and stayNo fees to use abroad"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/13/15/4E316FC400000578-5950805-The_65_year_old_is_looking_a_bit_glum_as_he_enters_the_black_car-a-36_1531493460349.jpg","title":"Tired looking casually dressed Tony Blair 65 seen getting chauffeur driven car","story":"    Tony Blair has been spotted getting into a car in Mayfair, London.

He succeeded just in time: the manager of the land where the elephants were roaming phoned to say that he wouldn’t keep them for another day.‘If they don’t leave tomorrow, we’ll have to shoot them,’ he said. The next day, he called again. ‘We had some trouble with the matriarch,’ he said without preamble. ‘I shot her. She’s a bloody nightmare and would have broken out of your reserve and flattened someone. I took out the baby, too.’I was beside myself with anger and despair.Even I knew that a herd’s matriarch is their teacher, referee, keeper of memories, travel guide and bush stateswoman rolled into one.‘This is bad, Frankie, really bad,’ Lawrence said to me. ‘How the hell did he think this poor herd would cope after losing their leader? He probably shot the matriarch right in front of them.’I began to worry even more about what we were taking on.The herd had already been in a bad way, and now they’d be even more traumatised — but without a leader to calm them. In the middle of that night, in torrential rain, the seven other elephants arrived in three huge articulated trucks. Two breeding adult females, two teenagers, and three little ones under the age of ten.          The manager of the land where the elephants were roaming phoned to say he had killed the matriarch just days before the adoption          They led the elephants into a temporary enclosure, protected by a new electrified fence - but they weren\u0027t there for longMy heart froze at their terrified trumpeting and screeching as we struggled to get them into a temporary enclosure, protected by a new electrified fence.They weren’t there for long.By the next day, they’d worked out that pushing a nine-metre tree onto the electric fence would cause the wires to short. And off they went, heading northwards in the direction of their previous home. Hundreds of villages dot the hills and valleys around our game reserve in Zululand, so we knew there was every chance they’d be killed.You’d think it would be easy to find a herd of elephants, but it isn’t. For ten days, they managed to evade trackers on foot, in 4x4s and helicopters. And when we did at last get them back, we were warned by the authorities that they’d be shot if they escaped again.By then, it was clear that a new matriarch — whom we called Nana — had taken over, but the elephants were still deeply distressed. Drawing on his instincts, Lawrence did what he could to reassure them. Night after night, he stayed as close to the flimsy wires as he dared, singing to them, talking to them and telling them stories until he was hoarse.He was utterly determined to breach their terror of man.One hot afternoon, he came home and said: ‘You won’t believe what happened. Nana put her trunk through the fence and touched my hand.’ My eyes widened in shock. Nana could easily have slung her trunk around his body and yanked him through the wires.‘Please get out of this alive,’ I begged.          For ten days, they managed to evade trackers on foot, in 4x4s and helicopters. And when we did get them back, we were warned by the authorities that they’d be shot if they escaped againThe next day, Lawrence released the herd into the game reserve. I was terrified he would be trampled to death, but day after day he tracked them and crept as close as he dared. His efforts didn’t go unnoticed by Nana, who started trying to protect him from the rest of the herd.Eventually, they developed a secret way of meeting.Lawrence would park his battered Land Rover half a kilometre away from the elephants and wait until Nana caught his scent in the air.Then she’d quietly separate from the others and amble towards him through the scrub, her trunk held high to show her delight.She would then swoop it all over him, with delicate touches with the tip, as he told her about his life — and Nana would respond with throaty rumbles.So how did it all start? Even now, I often gaze out into the bush, reflecting on how a chance meeting completely changed my life.Back then, I’d been a 33-year-old who worked for a chamber of commerce.In London for a trade show, I was standing in the taxi queue outside the Cumberland Hotel, running out of time to get to an appointment. The hotel porter asked if I’d be happy to share a cab with another guest, but I shook my head. I wasn’t in the mood for a chat with a tourist who’d dressed in white summer trousers and a blue plastic windcheater on a freezing winter’s day.My rudeness didn’t go unpunished, because half an hour later I still hadn’t managed to find a cab. Going back into the hotel to warm up, I bumped into the tourist.          Françoise met her husband Lawrence while in London for a trade show. The oddly dressed man, I discovered, was South African and in London on businessMortified, I offered to show him how to get to where he wanted on the Tube. The oddly dressed man, I discovered, was South African and in London on business. Somehow I ended up inviting him to join me at a jazz club that evening.And that was that, until one day the man announced that he was coming to visit me. As I was later to find out, flying more than 6,000 miles for a date was typical behaviour of Lawrence: he was bold, impulsive and never let anything stop him. A few months later, I boarded a flight to South Africa and, a year after our first meeting, I gave up my job and my flat and moved there for good.Needless to say, my friends thought I was out of my mind, but I knew I just had to be with this wonderful, funny, crazy man. It was that simple. His enthusiasm for life was infectious, convincing me we could do absolutely anything at all if we wanted it enough.Share this articleAnd let’s face it, our decision to give up a comfortable city life in Durban to buy 3,700 acres in KwaZulu-Natal was pretty mad. Lawrence’s plan was to convince tribal elders to add on their own surrounding lands, to turn the reserve into a massive conservation area. And that’s exactly what came to pass.Protecting the animals cost a fortune, of course, but we built an upmarket ‘eco-tourism’ lodge, with seven chalets, and were soon welcoming paying guests from around the world.We called the reserve Thula Thula — ‘thula’ is Zulu for ‘quiet’ — because it suggested peace and tranquillity. Not that it was ever totally quiet: at night, we’d sit on our veranda, listening to the soft grunts, squeals, whistles and chirrups of countless animals, birds and insects.          A few months later, I boarded a flight to South Africa and, a year after our first meeting, I gave up my job and my flat and moved there for goodA year after the elephants arrived, we tried to rescue a fourth female. We’d been alerted to her plight by Dr Marion Garaï, a researcher who has studied elephants for more than 30 years.This particular one was aged 12. She’d been part of a group of seven orphans, but her owner had got fed up with them and dumped them on various reserves. To Marion’s horror, she discovered that the young elephant had been alone for a whole year — which is comparable to abandoning a 12-year-old human child.What happened next was shameful: before we could do anything, her owner had auctioned her to the highest bidder, an American hunter.‘Apparently the hunter’s in a wheelchair, so I suppose a frightened young elephant without a herd to protect her is the only way he’s going to get his trophy,’ said Marion bitterly.We were devastated.Here was a young elephant who’d lost her family, not once but twice, who’d been shifted from one reserve to another and condemned to a solitary miserable life — and now her beautiful face was going to end up above some American’s fireplace.Only a miracle, we felt, could save her. And, amazingly, in March 2000, it came through.Her American owner’s application for a new hunting permit was denied. We never found out why, and we didn’t care.          By 2012, 13 years after the arrival of the elephants, the herd had swelled from seven to 21But our problems weren’t over.The regional authorities had heard that our little elephant was ‘trouble’ and refused to grant us the necessary permit for her removal.At this point, Marion — who’d never met the animal — risked her professional credibility to swear the troubled little elephant would be fine.But would she? What if our own herd rejected her?Lawrence was certain they had too much compassion for that. ‘They’ve been through what she’s been through,’ he said. ‘They know the horror of having their families shot in front of them.’Finally, the permit was approved, and the little one arrived at Thula Thula. We put her straight into an enclosure and Lawrence set up camp outside it.She hated his presence, charging him every time he approached the wires. Animosity and fear turned her eyes black with rage.We christened her ET — short for enfant terrible.‘She’s had so much trauma packed into that little life of hers,’ said Lawrence. ‘We’re not going to give up on her now.’ET’s rage was terrifying enough, but then it turned into the deepest despair. The unfamiliar territory, scary new smells and terrifying humans were too much.She stopped eating, no longer bothered to charge Lawrence, and just walked around and around in listless circles. ET had given up. What could we do? You can’t hug an angry elephant. Lawrence would have camped beside her for months if he’d thought that would help, but ET looked as if she’d lost the will to live.‘We’ve got to get Nana here,’ he said. ‘If she doesn’t get company soon, she’s going to die of heartbreak.’Using food and sweet talk, he lured the herd from miles away to ET’s enclosure.What happened next was extraordinary.The minute Nana and another older female, Frankie, set eyes on the frightened elephant child, they lumbered up to the fence and started talking to her, floating their trunks between the wires to touch her.          On March 1, she was alone at Thula Thula as Lawrence was away on business. The next day she got a phone call telling her he had died of a heart attack ET stared at them, transfixed. They were the first elephants she’d seen in a year. Tentatively, she raised her trunk to theirs. Quiet rumbles rolled between them. Even our macho rangers were wiping their eyes.Then the rest of the herd came closer to say ‘hello’.‘I think they’re reassuring her,’ murmured one of the Zulu rangers. ‘They’re probably telling her their story — that they, too, lost their families and know what it’s like to be frightened and alone. They’re saying: “You’re going to be fine. We’ll walk with you.” ’ I choked back tears, hoping with all my heart that he was right.It was time to open the gate between the enclosure and the reserve, to let ET join the herd.At first, she kept walking past the open gate, unsure of what to do. Nana and Frankie milled about, trying to show her where to go. But still ET hadn’t twigged she was free to leave.Eventually, when the herd began to lumber off, she let out a strangled cry.‘Oh my God! The poor thing has no voice,’ said LawrenceWe later learned that after ET had lost her companions in her previous home, she’d shrieked herself hoarse and permanently damaged her vocal cords. To this day, she can only squeeze out strangled honking noises.Just as we were about to give up and close the gate again, ET paused in front of it, her eyes on the disappearing elephants, and walked straight through.The herd accepted her with tenderness and compassion, ensuring that for her first few months of freedom, she was never left alone.By 2012, 13 years after the arrival of the elephants, the herd had swelled from seven to 21. On March 1, I was alone at Thula Thula. Lawrence was away on business, though calling me frequently because he was worried about a storm heading our way.When the phone rang at 7am the following morning, I assumed it would be him. Instead, it was a voice telling me that my indestructible husband had died of a heart attack during the night.I didn’t believe it. I sank onto our bed, numb with shock. How could I survive without him?We loved each other we’d been partners in everything. We’d learned on the hop, tackling each challenge that came our way with courage, craziness and plenty of laughter. And now, from one day to the next, he was just gone. It was unthinkable. I stumbled through that day and the next in a daze.          Very early the following morning, a ranger called to say that the herd were heading towards the lodge. I was flabbergasted. The last sighting of them had been during the worst of the storm alerts, when they’d been a good 12 hours’ walk from usThen, very early the following morning, a ranger called to say that the herd were heading towards the lodge.I was flabbergasted. The last sighting of them had been during the worst of the storm alerts, when they’d been a good 12 hours’ walk from us.Soon, the herd was right at the back gate. Even the bulls were there — unusual, because bachelor elephants tend to stay away from the others, or at least out of sight.Other aspects of the elephants’ behaviour were out of character, too. They hardly ever visited the lodge, unless they had a new baby to introduce to us, and then they’d stand peacefully grazing, gently nudging the new arrival forward to meet Lawrence.This time, however, all 21 of them were jostling about at the gate, clearly agitated. Restless, they walked in a jumble to the front of the lodge, stayed there for a few minutes, then paced round to the back again.On their faces — even those of the babies — I could see the telltale streaks of anxiety.An elephant’s temporal gland, which sits between its eyes and ears, secretes liquid when the animal is stressed, which can create the mistaken impression that it’s crying.So they weren’t crying — I knew that — but the moist dark lines running down their massive cheeks showed that something had deeply affected them.After about 40 minutes, they lined up at the fence that separates our home from the bush.Suddenly, solemn rumbles rolled through the air, the same low-frequency language they’d always used with Lawrence.Nana, alone, stopped pacing and stood still. It was almost as if she were waiting for Lawrence to appear, yet aware that he wasn’t there.          Other aspects of the elephants’ behaviour were out of character, too. All 21 of them were jostling about at the gate, clearly agitated. Restless, they walked in a jumble to the front of the lodge, stayed there for a few minutes, then paced round to the back againWe hadn’t seen the herd in months. Why had they come — and why were they so anxious?Science has no answers, but to me their visit made perfect sense. When my husband’s heart stopped, something stirred in theirs, and they crossed miles and miles of wilderness to mourn with us, to pay their respects, just as they do when one of their own has died.On the first anniversary of Lawrence’s death, I organised a simple memorial service and then headed reluctantly for Durban for a week crammed with appointments.At the end of my first day back in the city, I opened a text from one of our rangers.‘They’re at the main house!’ it said. Who? What did he mean? Had I missed a meeting? I clicked open the photos he’d attached.And there was the entire elephant herd, surrounding my house at Thula Thula.Their backs glistened like ebony in the fading light. I was stunned.To the exact day, it was a year since they’d turned up just after Lawrence’s death. And every one of us who works at Thula Thula knew why they’d come.Elephants mourn their dead for a long time. Years after one of our old bulls died, the herd would keep returning to the spot where his bones lay and linger for hours, dark streaks lining their cheeks, as they gently touched his remains.And now these beautiful, sensitive creatures were doing exactly what we’d done two days earlier: they were marking Lawrence’s death in their own way.  Science has no answers, but to me their visit made perfect sense. When my husband’s heart stopped, something stirred in theirs, and they crossed miles and miles of wilderness to mourn with us, to pay their respects, just as they do when one of their own has diedHis ashes had long since been absorbed by the earth, leaving them with nothing physical to touch and revere. So, instead, they’d returned to where Lawrence had lived.Never in a million years did I think I’d have another chance at love.But a few years after Lawrence’s death, I met a gentle, silver-haired man called Clément who completely understood what Thula Thula meant to me.One weekend, we both joined a couple of people who were going for a game-drive in our Land Cruiser. Suddenly, we saw the elephants coming towards us along a dirt track.My heart thudded as they ambled towards us.Frankie and Nana were in the lead, the other mums behind them with their little ones holding onto their tails, and trailing further back were the bulls.To my astonishment, the oldest bull, Gobisa, walked straight up to Clément and stopped in front of him.We held our breath as the elephant’s huge body blocked out the sky. Leaning his massive forehead against the Land Cruiser’s canopy, he started gently prodding Clément’s side with his tusks. Next, he fluttered his trunk tenderly over his chest, before going on to explore his cheeks, nose and hair.As we started up the engine and prepared to leave, Gobisa finally stepped back. But he continued to study my new man, returning to touch him one last time before sauntering off.My Zulu rangers had no difficulty in interpreting the elephant’s behaviour.As the herd’s oldest bull, Gobisa had simply been checking out my new mate, making sure he was a worthy successor to their beloved Lawrence.Adapted by Corinna Honan from An Elephant In My Kitchen by Françoise Malby-Anthony \u0026amp Katja Willemsen, published by Sidgwick \u0026amp Jackson on July 26 at £16.99. © 2018 Françoise Malby-Anthony \u0026amp Katja Willemsen.

Her husband Tony is seen proudly wearing his thoughWhile being seen in the official uniform sends a strong message, the fleece also serves a very practical purpose in the aptly named resort town, where temperatures in the summer can dip into the 40s at daybreak and then rocket into the 80s by noon.That\u0027s why fleeces, along with nylon windbreakers and vests, polos and hats are all up for the taking when guests check in to the conference.Day one kicks off in the afternoon, but the following four all begin at daybreak, with guests grabbing breakfast and  heading off to the first session of the day as the bank of press photographers who are kept penned up on the perimeter of the venue snap away for the few minutes they have to capture the billionaires.And it\u0027s not too hard to recognize the heavy hitters, who are usually dressed in red, white or blue fleece.The only change made to the outerwear at each conference is the year embroidered on the chest of each jacket and vest, next to the town’s initials, SV.The colors and style remain the same.           Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch is a fan of the vest, though his son Lachlan has not been seen rugging up in the official merchandise           Belinda Johnson, COO of AirBnB, chose a red parka for the 2018 conference  Horizon Media founder Bill Koenigsberg, Mexican beverage tycoon Jose Antonio Fernandez and Michael Dell, founder of Dell Technologies, all chose a blue fleece vest, teamed with a pale blue shirtAlmost every guest dons their vest, often with straight leg jeans, Nikes and designer sunglasses of the ‘O’ or ‘P’ variety - Oakley, Pearsol or Oliver Peoples.There are of course exceptions, with some preferring Patagonia or their own golf fleeces or pullovers or hoodies.Him too?

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, vice president Dan Rose and COO Sheryl Sandberg all shunned the unofficial uniform           Prominent banker Dan Lufkin is another fleece vest devotee. He, like many others, chooses to pair his with a pale blue shirtChildren get a green lanyard and staff one in red at the event, where guests are encouraged to bring their families for the five-day conference.Diane Von Furstenberg loves to layer, but generally opts for more luxurious fabrics by wearing leather coats and cashmere scarfs as she braves the Idaho chill.Jerry Hall, who arrived this ear on the arm of her husband Rupert Murdoch, and has served as a muse for the the biggest names in fashion (Halston and von Furstenbrg), art (Andy Warhol and Ed Ruscha) and rock (Bryan Ferry and Mick Jagger), did not wear anything resembling a vest or a parka, let alone in fleece.The same goes for the designer Tamara Mellon, whose aesthetic is more suede and silk than sheep and synthetic.And then there is Stacey Bendet.The Alice and Olivia CEO and creative director stole the show yet again this year, managing to stand out from the crowd with her stunning selection of sartorial choices over the course of the five-day event.  Alice and Olivia CEO Stacey Bendet is not one for conformity. Instead, she turned heads with bright dresses and oversized accessories She averaged two looks a day in a variety of colors, prints materials and lengths, changing up everything but her perfectly coiffed-hair and heavily-lined eyes as she headed out on campus, joining her billionaire father-in-law Michel Eisner and husband Eric at the event.The photographs of the alabaster beauty with raven-black hair that were taken over the course of the week bring to mind a certain Disney princess who also found herself in the middle of the woods trudging after a group of middle-aged leisure-wear enthusiasts each morning.In both instances it was the fair-skinned heroine that stole the show, while the little men around her inconspicuously built up their wealth.Because who would ever imagine that seven dwarves were mining a multi-billion dollar diamond mine in those over-sized shirt dresses, or that the biggest deals in American business were being negotiated by a few dudes in fleece.

Trump breaks protocol during Royal visit...Share this article\u0027The standards would be the same. That therefore removes the need for inspection at the border. But in terms of market access the United Kingdom would have a great deal of freedom.\u0027Dr Fox said that unlike fellow Brexiteers Boris Johnson and David Davis, he had not considered resigning over the compromise plan hammered out by senior ministers and he urged the EU to take up the proposed offer in the interests of all their people.He said: \u0027We are making a realistic and positive offer to the European Union. I hope we will get their support because what we need to have is a people\u0027s Brexit, not a bureaucrat\u0027s Brexit.\u0027\u0027We now need to think about the well-being of people across Europe, about their prosperity, their jobs, their security, and not about the abstractions of the bureaucrats of Brussels.  Following Theresa May\u0027s meeting with President Donald Trump  at Chequers (pictured), Dr Fox said \u0027very positive\u0027 discussions had been taking place with US officials on a future deal\u0027I think most people in Britain will think this is that this is a fair, pragmatic and reasonable approach.\u0027However, the former permanent secretary at the Department for International Trade, Sir Martin Donnelly, warned the UK would have to give more ground if it wanted a deal with Brussels.He told the BBC: \u0027If we want to have a lot of scope to do trade deals around the world it is going to be very difficult to have a close relationship with the European Union. That\u0027s the key trade-off that we have got to deal with. \u0027It is going to come down, I think, to how far the UK is prepared to follow the same rules and take on the same obligations as others in the European Union to retain access to that market. \u0027If we don\u0027t want to do that, clearly we have got more scope to do trade deals internationally.\u0027The problem is of course that most of our trade in goods, and especially in services, is with the European Union and the problem for business is that, if we start putting up barriers on that trade with Europe, then the effect on investment – and we are already seeing this – and therefore British jobs becomes very serious.\u0027If we want to have a lot of access to Europe, it is more difficult to do trade deals around the world. You can\u0027t really have it both ways.\u0027I think the UK is going to have to be prepared to move quite a lot further if it really wants to maintain that access which is so important for business in goods and also in services.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/12/18/4E282ADA00000578-0-image-m-20_1531415999384.jpg","title":"Presidents former adviser Steve Bannon reveals advice ignored Brexit deal","story":"Share this articleTom Newton Dunn (@tnewtondunn) on TwitterI told May how to do Brexit but she wrecked it ¿ the US trade deal is off, says Donald TrumpRevealed: The \u0027brutal\u0027 advice Donald Trump gave to Theresa May on Brexit talks with Brussels"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/14/12/4E3B05E500000578-5953553-image-m-48_1531568714845.jpg","title":"Its greatest honour Sir David Attenborough launches namesake ship","story":"    Sir David Attenborough (centre) has launched his namesake ship - which the public originally voted to be called Boaty McBoatface  The English broadcaster and naturalist said it was \u0027the greatest possible honour\u0027 to see the hull with his name on it   RRS Sir David Attenborough, a 129-metre-long, 10,000-tonne vessel, made its debut today at River Mersey in Liverpool This was rejected after Ministers intervened to insist on a more appropriate name. Sir Attenborough said at the event: \u0027Our future and everybody\u0027s future will be affected by what people on this ship will be discovering for years to come.  \u0027To see this magnificent hull with my name on it is the greatest possible honour.\u0027  Sky weather presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar is reduced to tears...Aldi is forced to urgently recall a popular children\u0027s toy...Share this articleMembers of the public were invited to view the vessel\u0027s launch, with the hull then being taken to Cammell Laird\u0027s wet basin where shipbuilders will work on finishing the ship.It is expected to be completed next year and will be used by the British Antarctic Survey for polar research.     However the polar ship could have been bestowed a rather different title as Boaty McBoastface came out top in an internet poll staged by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)           The ship has been named after Sir Attenborough because of his work presenting wildlife documentariesAsked how he felt when he saw the ship enter the water, Sir Attenborough said: \u0027It was an extraordinarily emotional moment.

Scratchcards: Many people win small prizes - and may forget about claimingThe figures are for the 201718 financial year, ending 31 March 2018. The firm says it publicises all prizes of £50,000 and above saying it releases to local media the area where an unclaimed ticket has been bought approximately two weeks after the draw to raise awareness and also publishes this on its website.It adds that it undertakes activity in those areas tailored to the prize and location.It says: \u0027Examples of previous activity include working with football clubs such as PA announcements at half time, advertorials in match day programmes, working with relevant local third parties\u0027 social media channels, information targeted at commuters at relevant transport hubs as well as more traditional PR activity designed to drive media coverage.\u0027We also undertake radio interviews to drive awareness. We\u0027re delighted to say we have had lots of examples of winners who have seen media coverage or heard a radio interview and come forward as a result.\u0027So what about if you find a ticket after that 180 day period? Would you have any chance of claiming your prize?Under the rules for playing National Lottery games agreed with regulator, the Gambling Commission, players have 180 days to claim their prize.If players contact it - either by calling the National Lottery Line or by emailing - before the end of the 180-day claim period to notify that they intend to claim their prize, they must make their claim in person within seven days of the end of the 180-day claim period.A spokesman added: \u0027We also offer a service for anyone who believes they have a genuine claim but is no longer in possession of their ticket because it has been lost, destroyed or stolen.\u0027In these circumstances, players must contact us in writing within 30 days of the draw in question to make a claim.\u0027Based on the information provided by the claimant, we, may at our discretion, investigate and consider the validity of the claim.\u0027If we are satisfied that the claim is valid, we may, at our further discretion, pay the prize after the end of the 180-day claim period for that draw.\u0027Some examples of huge prizes that went unclaimed include a £65million EuroMillions jackpot in 2012, with the ticket bought in the Stevenage and Hitchin region of Hertfordshire.In 2007, a ticket bought in Devon for the Euromillions won £6.9million but that went unclaimed – as did a £9.4million Lotto jackpot from a ticket purchased in Doncaster in 2005.And in 2006, the Lotto jackpot was won by two tickets, splitting 3.3million between them. One ticket was bought in Glasgow and the other in Warwickshire – and neither stepped forward to claim the prize.Unclaimed prizes end up going to a good causes fund. To date, £38billion has headed to 535,000 projects across Britain, a small portion of which has been from unclaimed wins. The decision on how and where funding is invested is made by 12 specialist organisations. These are chosen by Parliament for their knowledge and expertise to help ensure the money goes where it is needed.In the year ending 31 March 2018, 40 per cent of funds went to health, education, environmental and charitable causes, while 20 per cent went to sports, arts and heritage. £185 M\u0026S vouchers to switch and stayNo fees to use abroad"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/13/15/04F7B848000007D0-0-image-a-2_1531492630720.jpg","title":"Philip Hammond DEFENDS Brexit plan City London criticism","story":"    Philip Hammond (file) today defended Britain\u0027s proposed Brexit deal after the City of London warned it would trash the booming banking industry          The City of London Corporation has insisted Brexit cannot mean looser ties to Europe\u0027s financial centres without costing jobs and investment (file image of the City\u0027s Square Mile) Mr Hammond told the Financial Times: \u0027We set out a realistic framework that provides sufficient stability and certainty for the market to operate.\u0027This is less than mutual recognition, but it is more than the EU\u0027s equivalence regime.

He succeeded just in time: the manager of the land where the elephants were roaming phoned to say that he wouldn’t keep them for another day.‘If they don’t leave tomorrow, we’ll have to shoot them,’ he said. The next day, he called again. ‘We had some trouble with the matriarch,’ he said without preamble. ‘I shot her. She’s a bloody nightmare and would have broken out of your reserve and flattened someone. I took out the baby, too.’I was beside myself with anger and despair.Even I knew that a herd’s matriarch is their teacher, referee, keeper of memories, travel guide and bush stateswoman rolled into one.‘This is bad, Frankie, really bad,’ Lawrence said to me. ‘How the hell did he think this poor herd would cope after losing their leader? He probably shot the matriarch right in front of them.’I began to worry even more about what we were taking on.The herd had already been in a bad way, and now they’d be even more traumatised — but without a leader to calm them. In the middle of that night, in torrential rain, the seven other elephants arrived in three huge articulated trucks. Two breeding adult females, two teenagers, and three little ones under the age of ten.          The manager of the land where the elephants were roaming phoned to say he had killed the matriarch just days before the adoption          They led the elephants into a temporary enclosure, protected by a new electrified fence - but they weren\u0027t there for longMy heart froze at their terrified trumpeting and screeching as we struggled to get them into a temporary enclosure, protected by a new electrified fence.They weren’t there for long.By the next day, they’d worked out that pushing a nine-metre tree onto the electric fence would cause the wires to short. And off they went, heading northwards in the direction of their previous home. Hundreds of villages dot the hills and valleys around our game reserve in Zululand, so we knew there was every chance they’d be killed.You’d think it would be easy to find a herd of elephants, but it isn’t. For ten days, they managed to evade trackers on foot, in 4x4s and helicopters. And when we did at last get them back, we were warned by the authorities that they’d be shot if they escaped again.By then, it was clear that a new matriarch — whom we called Nana — had taken over, but the elephants were still deeply distressed. Drawing on his instincts, Lawrence did what he could to reassure them. Night after night, he stayed as close to the flimsy wires as he dared, singing to them, talking to them and telling them stories until he was hoarse.He was utterly determined to breach their terror of man.One hot afternoon, he came home and said: ‘You won’t believe what happened. Nana put her trunk through the fence and touched my hand.’ My eyes widened in shock. Nana could easily have slung her trunk around his body and yanked him through the wires.‘Please get out of this alive,’ I begged.          For ten days, they managed to evade trackers on foot, in 4x4s and helicopters. And when we did get them back, we were warned by the authorities that they’d be shot if they escaped againThe next day, Lawrence released the herd into the game reserve. I was terrified he would be trampled to death, but day after day he tracked them and crept as close as he dared. His efforts didn’t go unnoticed by Nana, who started trying to protect him from the rest of the herd.Eventually, they developed a secret way of meeting.Lawrence would park his battered Land Rover half a kilometre away from the elephants and wait until Nana caught his scent in the air.Then she’d quietly separate from the others and amble towards him through the scrub, her trunk held high to show her delight.She would then swoop it all over him, with delicate touches with the tip, as he told her about his life — and Nana would respond with throaty rumbles.So how did it all start? Even now, I often gaze out into the bush, reflecting on how a chance meeting completely changed my life.Back then, I’d been a 33-year-old who worked for a chamber of commerce.In London for a trade show, I was standing in the taxi queue outside the Cumberland Hotel, running out of time to get to an appointment. The hotel porter asked if I’d be happy to share a cab with another guest, but I shook my head. I wasn’t in the mood for a chat with a tourist who’d dressed in white summer trousers and a blue plastic windcheater on a freezing winter’s day.My rudeness didn’t go unpunished, because half an hour later I still hadn’t managed to find a cab. Going back into the hotel to warm up, I bumped into the tourist.          Françoise met her husband Lawrence while in London for a trade show. The oddly dressed man, I discovered, was South African and in London on businessMortified, I offered to show him how to get to where he wanted on the Tube. The oddly dressed man, I discovered, was South African and in London on business. Somehow I ended up inviting him to join me at a jazz club that evening.And that was that, until one day the man announced that he was coming to visit me. As I was later to find out, flying more than 6,000 miles for a date was typical behaviour of Lawrence: he was bold, impulsive and never let anything stop him. A few months later, I boarded a flight to South Africa and, a year after our first meeting, I gave up my job and my flat and moved there for good.Needless to say, my friends thought I was out of my mind, but I knew I just had to be with this wonderful, funny, crazy man. It was that simple. His enthusiasm for life was infectious, convincing me we could do absolutely anything at all if we wanted it enough.Share this articleAnd let’s face it, our decision to give up a comfortable city life in Durban to buy 3,700 acres in KwaZulu-Natal was pretty mad. Lawrence’s plan was to convince tribal elders to add on their own surrounding lands, to turn the reserve into a massive conservation area. And that’s exactly what came to pass.Protecting the animals cost a fortune, of course, but we built an upmarket ‘eco-tourism’ lodge, with seven chalets, and were soon welcoming paying guests from around the world.We called the reserve Thula Thula — ‘thula’ is Zulu for ‘quiet’ — because it suggested peace and tranquillity. Not that it was ever totally quiet: at night, we’d sit on our veranda, listening to the soft grunts, squeals, whistles and chirrups of countless animals, birds and insects.          A few months later, I boarded a flight to South Africa and, a year after our first meeting, I gave up my job and my flat and moved there for goodA year after the elephants arrived, we tried to rescue a fourth female. We’d been alerted to her plight by Dr Marion Garaï, a researcher who has studied elephants for more than 30 years.This particular one was aged 12. She’d been part of a group of seven orphans, but her owner had got fed up with them and dumped them on various reserves. To Marion’s horror, she discovered that the young elephant had been alone for a whole year — which is comparable to abandoning a 12-year-old human child.What happened next was shameful: before we could do anything, her owner had auctioned her to the highest bidder, an American hunter.‘Apparently the hunter’s in a wheelchair, so I suppose a frightened young elephant without a herd to protect her is the only way he’s going to get his trophy,’ said Marion bitterly.We were devastated.Here was a young elephant who’d lost her family, not once but twice, who’d been shifted from one reserve to another and condemned to a solitary miserable life — and now her beautiful face was going to end up above some American’s fireplace.Only a miracle, we felt, could save her. And, amazingly, in March 2000, it came through.Her American owner’s application for a new hunting permit was denied. We never found out why, and we didn’t care.          By 2012, 13 years after the arrival of the elephants, the herd had swelled from seven to 21But our problems weren’t over.The regional authorities had heard that our little elephant was ‘trouble’ and refused to grant us the necessary permit for her removal.At this point, Marion — who’d never met the animal — risked her professional credibility to swear the troubled little elephant would be fine.But would she? What if our own herd rejected her?Lawrence was certain they had too much compassion for that. ‘They’ve been through what she’s been through,’ he said. ‘They know the horror of having their families shot in front of them.’Finally, the permit was approved, and the little one arrived at Thula Thula. We put her straight into an enclosure and Lawrence set up camp outside it.She hated his presence, charging him every time he approached the wires. Animosity and fear turned her eyes black with rage.We christened her ET — short for enfant terrible.‘She’s had so much trauma packed into that little life of hers,’ said Lawrence. ‘We’re not going to give up on her now.’ET’s rage was terrifying enough, but then it turned into the deepest despair. The unfamiliar territory, scary new smells and terrifying humans were too much.She stopped eating, no longer bothered to charge Lawrence, and just walked around and around in listless circles. ET had given up. What could we do? You can’t hug an angry elephant. Lawrence would have camped beside her for months if he’d thought that would help, but ET looked as if she’d lost the will to live.‘We’ve got to get Nana here,’ he said. ‘If she doesn’t get company soon, she’s going to die of heartbreak.’Using food and sweet talk, he lured the herd from miles away to ET’s enclosure.What happened next was extraordinary.The minute Nana and another older female, Frankie, set eyes on the frightened elephant child, they lumbered up to the fence and started talking to her, floating their trunks between the wires to touch her.          On March 1, she was alone at Thula Thula as Lawrence was away on business. The next day she got a phone call telling her he had died of a heart attack ET stared at them, transfixed. They were the first elephants she’d seen in a year. Tentatively, she raised her trunk to theirs. Quiet rumbles rolled between them. Even our macho rangers were wiping their eyes.Then the rest of the herd came closer to say ‘hello’.‘I think they’re reassuring her,’ murmured one of the Zulu rangers. ‘They’re probably telling her their story — that they, too, lost their families and know what it’s like to be frightened and alone. They’re saying: “You’re going to be fine. We’ll walk with you.” ’ I choked back tears, hoping with all my heart that he was right.It was time to open the gate between the enclosure and the reserve, to let ET join the herd.At first, she kept walking past the open gate, unsure of what to do. Nana and Frankie milled about, trying to show her where to go. But still ET hadn’t twigged she was free to leave.Eventually, when the herd began to lumber off, she let out a strangled cry.‘Oh my God! The poor thing has no voice,’ said LawrenceWe later learned that after ET had lost her companions in her previous home, she’d shrieked herself hoarse and permanently damaged her vocal cords. To this day, she can only squeeze out strangled honking noises.Just as we were about to give up and close the gate again, ET paused in front of it, her eyes on the disappearing elephants, and walked straight through.The herd accepted her with tenderness and compassion, ensuring that for her first few months of freedom, she was never left alone.By 2012, 13 years after the arrival of the elephants, the herd had swelled from seven to 21. On March 1, I was alone at Thula Thula. Lawrence was away on business, though calling me frequently because he was worried about a storm heading our way.When the phone rang at 7am the following morning, I assumed it would be him. Instead, it was a voice telling me that my indestructible husband had died of a heart attack during the night.I didn’t believe it. I sank onto our bed, numb with shock. How could I survive without him?We loved each other we’d been partners in everything. We’d learned on the hop, tackling each challenge that came our way with courage, craziness and plenty of laughter. And now, from one day to the next, he was just gone. It was unthinkable. I stumbled through that day and the next in a daze.          Very early the following morning, a ranger called to say that the herd were heading towards the lodge. I was flabbergasted. The last sighting of them had been during the worst of the storm alerts, when they’d been a good 12 hours’ walk from usThen, very early the following morning, a ranger called to say that the herd were heading towards the lodge.I was flabbergasted. The last sighting of them had been during the worst of the storm alerts, when they’d been a good 12 hours’ walk from us.Soon, the herd was right at the back gate. Even the bulls were there — unusual, because bachelor elephants tend to stay away from the others, or at least out of sight.Other aspects of the elephants’ behaviour were out of character, too. They hardly ever visited the lodge, unless they had a new baby to introduce to us, and then they’d stand peacefully grazing, gently nudging the new arrival forward to meet Lawrence.This time, however, all 21 of them were jostling about at the gate, clearly agitated. Restless, they walked in a jumble to the front of the lodge, stayed there for a few minutes, then paced round to the back again.On their faces — even those of the babies — I could see the telltale streaks of anxiety.An elephant’s temporal gland, which sits between its eyes and ears, secretes liquid when the animal is stressed, which can create the mistaken impression that it’s crying.So they weren’t crying — I knew that — but the moist dark lines running down their massive cheeks showed that something had deeply affected them.After about 40 minutes, they lined up at the fence that separates our home from the bush.Suddenly, solemn rumbles rolled through the air, the same low-frequency language they’d always used with Lawrence.Nana, alone, stopped pacing and stood still. It was almost as if she were waiting for Lawrence to appear, yet aware that he wasn’t there.          Other aspects of the elephants’ behaviour were out of character, too. All 21 of them were jostling about at the gate, clearly agitated. Restless, they walked in a jumble to the front of the lodge, stayed there for a few minutes, then paced round to the back againWe hadn’t seen the herd in months. Why had they come — and why were they so anxious?Science has no answers, but to me their visit made perfect sense. When my husband’s heart stopped, something stirred in theirs, and they crossed miles and miles of wilderness to mourn with us, to pay their respects, just as they do when one of their own has died.On the first anniversary of Lawrence’s death, I organised a simple memorial service and then headed reluctantly for Durban for a week crammed with appointments.At the end of my first day back in the city, I opened a text from one of our rangers.‘They’re at the main house!’ it said. Who? What did he mean? Had I missed a meeting? I clicked open the photos he’d attached.And there was the entire elephant herd, surrounding my house at Thula Thula.Their backs glistened like ebony in the fading light. I was stunned.To the exact day, it was a year since they’d turned up just after Lawrence’s death. And every one of us who works at Thula Thula knew why they’d come.Elephants mourn their dead for a long time. Years after one of our old bulls died, the herd would keep returning to the spot where his bones lay and linger for hours, dark streaks lining their cheeks, as they gently touched his remains.And now these beautiful, sensitive creatures were doing exactly what we’d done two days earlier: they were marking Lawrence’s death in their own way.  Science has no answers, but to me their visit made perfect sense. When my husband’s heart stopped, something stirred in theirs, and they crossed miles and miles of wilderness to mourn with us, to pay their respects, just as they do when one of their own has diedHis ashes had long since been absorbed by the earth, leaving them with nothing physical to touch and revere. So, instead, they’d returned to where Lawrence had lived.Never in a million years did I think I’d have another chance at love.But a few years after Lawrence’s death, I met a gentle, silver-haired man called Clément who completely understood what Thula Thula meant to me.One weekend, we both joined a couple of people who were going for a game-drive in our Land Cruiser. Suddenly, we saw the elephants coming towards us along a dirt track.My heart thudded as they ambled towards us.Frankie and Nana were in the lead, the other mums behind them with their little ones holding onto their tails, and trailing further back were the bulls.To my astonishment, the oldest bull, Gobisa, walked straight up to Clément and stopped in front of him.We held our breath as the elephant’s huge body blocked out the sky. Leaning his massive forehead against the Land Cruiser’s canopy, he started gently prodding Clément’s side with his tusks. Next, he fluttered his trunk tenderly over his chest, before going on to explore his cheeks, nose and hair.As we started up the engine and prepared to leave, Gobisa finally stepped back. But he continued to study my new man, returning to touch him one last time before sauntering off.My Zulu rangers had no difficulty in interpreting the elephant’s behaviour.As the herd’s oldest bull, Gobisa had simply been checking out my new mate, making sure he was a worthy successor to their beloved Lawrence.Adapted by Corinna Honan from An Elephant In My Kitchen by Françoise Malby-Anthony \u0026amp Katja Willemsen, published by Sidgwick \u0026amp Jackson on July 26 at £16.99. © 2018 Françoise Malby-Anthony \u0026amp Katja Willemsen.

He, like many others, chooses to pair his with a pale blue shirtChildren get a green lanyard and staff one in red at the event, where guests are encouraged to bring their families for the five-day conference.Diane Von Furstenberg loves to layer, but generally opts for more luxurious fabrics by wearing leather coats and cashmere scarfs as she braves the Idaho chill.Jerry Hall, who arrived this ear on the arm of her husband Rupert Murdoch, and has served as a muse for the the biggest names in fashion (Halston and von Furstenbrg), art (Andy Warhol and Ed Ruscha) and rock (Bryan Ferry and Mick Jagger), did not wear anything resembling a vest or a parka, let alone in fleece.The same goes for the designer Tamara Mellon, whose aesthetic is more suede and silk than sheep and synthetic.And then there is Stacey Bendet.The Alice and Olivia CEO and creative director stole the show yet again this year, managing to stand out from the crowd with her stunning selection of sartorial choices over the course of the five-day event.  Alice and Olivia CEO Stacey Bendet is not one for conformity. Instead, she turned heads with bright dresses and oversized accessories She averaged two looks a day in a variety of colors, prints materials and lengths, changing up everything but her perfectly coiffed-hair and heavily-lined eyes as she headed out on campus, joining her billionaire father-in-law Michel Eisner and husband Eric at the event.The photographs of the alabaster beauty with raven-black hair that were taken over the course of the week bring to mind a certain Disney princess who also found herself in the middle of the woods trudging after a group of middle-aged leisure-wear enthusiasts each morning.In both instances it was the fair-skinned heroine that stole the show, while the little men around her inconspicuously built up their wealth.Because who would ever imagine that seven dwarves were mining a multi-billion dollar diamond mine in those over-sized shirt dresses, or that the biggest deals in American business were being negotiated by a few dudes in fleece.          The fashionista stood out among a sea of executives in fleece vests and pale blue shirts"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/14/08/4E3A1C9E00000578-0-image-m-7_1531553180444.jpg","title":"Sky weather girl Nazaneen Ghaffar trolled online","story":"    Nazaneen was reduced to tears after she received the online abuse but was flooded with support from fans and her co-presenters at the networkSharing the tweet from the troll, who goes by the name ultimategrumpy, Nazaneen wrote: \u0027Why is MY weight any of YOUR concern?\u0027Think before you speak.\u0027You don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on in my private life.

I\u0027m surprised myself really.\u0027I\u0027ve never seen a ship of that size get down a slipway and there was something very noble about it and very emotional. Irresistible.\u0027And, to think that it\u0027s going to go to the other end of the globe and do such valuable work and carry so many people from this country who will be working to find out all they can about the working of our planet is a marvellous thought.\u0027I am more honoured than I can say that that wonderful hull has got my name on it.\u0027The civilian ship, constructed by Cammell Laird, is the biggest to be built in the UK for the last 30 years.It has also been part of the government\u0027s largest investment in polar science since the Eighties.The £200million UK investment aims to discover new insights into climate change, pollution, and many other environmental concerns.           Sir Attenborough said at the event: \u0027Our future and everybody\u0027s future will be affected by what people on this ship will be discovering for years to come.\u0027 (Pictured: The broadcaster pressing the button to launch the ship)          He added: \u0027To see this magnificent hull with my name on it is the greatest possible honour.\u0027Sir Attenborough said: \u0027The perils facing this planet are far, far greater than they have ever been in its entire history, or at least since the end of the dinosaurs, certainly for the last few million years.\u0027There\u0027s nothing to compare with the perils we are facing, not only in the scale but in the speed at which they are happening and of course we now know that we are responsible for a lot of these changes that are taking place.\u0027You have to know what they are before you know how you can fix them so this ship is going to be key to the future salvage of our plant or at least its preservation.\u0027  RRS Sir David Attenborough will be used by the British Antarctic Survey for polar research once it is completed - hopefully by next year          The civilian ship, constructed by Cammell Laird, is the biggest to be built in the UK for the last 30 yearsThe research hull became known in 2016 after the name RRS Boaty McBoatface topped the poll staged by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).At the time, science minister Jo Johnson said the public call for suggestions had \u0027captured the imaginations\u0027.  However, Boaty lives on, in the form of a miniature, unmanned, yellow submarine on board the boat, which will be operated by the British Antartic Survey (BAS). The ship has been named after Sir Attenborough  because of his work presenting wildlife documentaries on the BBC including The Blue Planet, Planet Earth and Frozen Planet, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said.Sir Attenborough and Professor Dame Jane Francis, director of BAS, pressed the button to launch the vessel into the water in front of more than 2,000 shipyard workers, scientists, engineers and special guests, including Minister for Energy and Clean Growth Claire Perry MP.In a speech ahead of the launch, Ms Perry said: \u0027This ship will help us with the tools we need to understand what the world will look like if we let climate change run away and what we need to do to stop it.\u0027The ship was blessed by Bishop of Birkenhead Keith Sinclair before its launch and a field gun was fired by soldiers from the Royal Artillery 103 Regiment as it entered the Mersey. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45dfee06d1c402492e620669d9da3682e213c7da/99_251_3396_2037/master/3396.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b20ab4022bf41e488deb344f85f9922c","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"President Trump’s visit to the UK, World Cup heartbreak and the Thai boys rescued from a cave – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7683155f371f30315f10ec7a1ccf2479ef84604f/68_218_1579_948/master/1579.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc=\u0026amp;s=aa93edf8268daf7596bca827a4868a5a","title":"great summer ominous sun climate change","story":"1955, 1976 and 2018 – the weeks of sun that were once an innocent pleasure, I now see in the context of climate changeThe sun shone and shone over County Cork last week, just as it did over most of Britain. When we came last year, to the same place in the same week, the steep banks of the lanes grew thick with wild roses, fuchsia and foxgloves now the vegetation looked limper and dustier, the roses drier, the foxgloves solitary and stooped. But a poorer foreground view had its compensation in the background, where the lack of drizzle, cloud and mist revealed a rolling landscape of hills and woods that was unexpectedly Tuscan in its clarity. By four in the afternoon, the airless main streets of the small towns felt like ovens.On the coast east of Skibbereen we found a delightful cove, of the sort that in my experience rarely exists outside children’s fiction: perfect in its firm sand, its protective reefs of smooth black rock, and its warren of caves that ran back into the cliffs, invaded every day by the tide, and entirely free of plastic flotsam. The sea was calm and clear, and changed its shade of blue according to the depth and composition of the seabed. Moreover, it wasn’t chill. In 60-odd years swimming off the British coastline, I’ve rarely known water as welcoming or as hard to leave: even after 40 minutes, it seemed a shame to get out.Newspaper reports said the prolonged heatwave had raised sea temperatures in other places to over 20C, which sounded impossibly warm, almost like a heated swimming pool. In that temperature, there would surely be no dallying in the shallows, no theatrical shivering when the water reached crotch level, no complaining that the cold was unbearable, no need to stand there uncertainly while your companion, already swimming briskly, urged you to “get in and get it over with”. Instead immersion would be a swift, Mediterranean experience – a run or brisk walk into the sea and then a splash as you struck out for the ing platform.Temperatures in the Firth of Forth never made getting into the water so easy. To be consistently tempting, the estuary needed exceptional conditions – and the summer of 1955 provided them. The sun shone for weeks, and day after day my friends and I made the 10-minute walk to the beach – not a Blue Flag candidate, if Blue Flags had existed then, because a pipe ran right down the middle of it that carried sewage to the sea from the army barracks to the rear.Looking back, it seems odd that people made no fuss about this, or about another more torrential outlet not far upstream, where the sewage turned the sea pink with its infusions of potassium permanganate. But it was a beach, all the same, with a sandbank that appeared at low tide and a hut at the far end that opened on especially busy days to sell crisps and lemonade and by the second week, I had taught myself to swim.All kinds of things happened in 1955: Anthony Eden won the general election Princess Margaret announced that she didn’t intend to marry RAF Group Captain Peter\u0026nbspTownsend Ruth Ellis became the last woman to be hanged in the UK. I remember none of them. For me, it was the year I was turned brown by the sun.A family snapshot, one of our first in colour, shows me in swimming trunks, staring across a shiny flat sea towards a visiting American battleship, the USS Wisconsin, which lay anchored in the firth. My back is unselfconsciously brown – there had been no lying on towels and striving for this effect – which tells a story of capering about on the beach with no recourse to the plastic macs and sweaters that in most years the visitor to the Scottish seaside was wise to bring. (As the actor and comedian Stanley Baxter remembers, returned Glaswegian holidaymakers when questioned about the weather might reply stoically, “Well, it never kept us in.”)The strong sunlight gave everything a memorable clarity, just as it did in Ireland last week, so that certain scenes of no particular emotional importance remain fixed, when in other years they would have faded: the sight of a spoil tip near an old mine or ironworks – abandoned even in 1955 – that revealed an interior of bright red cinders where a jagged crack had split its grassy surface. It makes no sense to remember it, and yet there it is through the window of the Glasgow bus, under a bright blue sky.Unclothed adults at the seaside were then hardly visible, other than in newspaper pictures of crowded beaches at sophisticated resorts such as Ayr or Blackpool. When my grandfathers came to the beach, they retained their flat caps and waistcoats. My mother never owned a swimsuit. My father had trunks – as a boy he’d liked to swim – but I only once saw him wear them. None of this was very exceptional. I can’t think of any adult in our street who went to the beach and did much more than roll up a trouser leg.Nobody could have complained, as the aesthete James Lees-Milne did in his diary in July 1976: “Heatwave continuing. Whole country parched, and trees dying. Found E naked but for a pair of long blue shorts, with white skin, smarmed hair (for he had just had a bath), flabby muscles, pendulous breasts, looking like Picasso aged 90. How can aesthetic persons bear to be seen in this condition at 74 even by their intimates?”The great summers of my lifetime have been 1955, 1976 and now this one. With each, a little more innocence has been shed as well as clothes. Prolonged sunshine now seems ominous – a portent as well as a pleasure. Ireland, for instance, has a rural economy that largely depends on grass, and in a drought grass fails to thrive. That has huge consequences for every cattle farmer, but posterity may see it as no more than a little local difficulty, one of the negligible effects of a global temperature change that melts glaciers and ice caps. Carpe diem, then, in a cove near Skibbereen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e3f602dffee4cec2fc33f8c49842bbe0787f81b/0_167_5023_3014/master/5023.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14077ef3cab8d87897978aac090e6788","title":"pedallers pilgrimage britains best cycling routes","story":"Wild Cycling author Chris Sidwells shares nine of his favourite rides – from the rugged west Highlands of Scotland to the green and pleasant loops of the home counties  These rides are my choices based on a wide variety of cycling experiences. Don’t consider the routes prescriptive – they are merely an introduction to the possibilities for cycling in different parts of the UK. Use them as a basis for your own exploration of nine parts of the country, each offering a unique day’s cycling.Full English: the Chiltern Hills, BuckinghamshireDistance: 37 milesDifficulty: 610Start and finish: Princes RisboroughNearest station: Princes Risborough“England’s green and pleasant land” perfectly describes the Chilterns. Broad-leaf woods overhang deep seductive lanes that wriggle around and over these chalky hills. Red kites rule the sky, and cricket is played on village greens. The Chilterns are commuter country now, but still charming, and still very English.Head for Chinnor on the north-west edge of the hills, then ride towards them to pick up a cycle-way going south-west to Watlingon, where you leave the trail. Climb Watlington Hill, then go through Christmas Common and Turville Heath take a pitstop at the Barn cafe at Turville Heath Farm, which is excellent. Continue to Marlow, then head north-west along the B482, leaving at Stokenchurch, and go north through the lanes to Princes Risborough.The most unexpected: Dengie Peninsula, EssexDistance: 24 milesDifficulty: 410 (810 if it’s windy)Start and finish: Burnham-on-CrouchNearest station: Burnham-on-CrouchSqueezed between two rivers, just 24 crow-flying miles from the centre of London, there’s a time capsule called the Dengie Peninsula. For a basic loop, follow the B1021 north towards Bradwell, go left after Tillingham through Maylandsea and Latchington, then follow the B1010 back to Burnham-on-Crouch. You ride through rosy brick and painted clapboard villages, past a patchwork quilt of fields. There are little loops you could add, such as visiting Dengie Marshes where you might glimpse a rare hen harrier. It’s so quiet, so peaceful, it’s like riding through the 1950s. Distance: 45 milesDifficulty: 810Start and Finish: BodminNearest station: Bodmin Parkway A ride of stunning sea views with a taste of wild moorland. Follow the Camel Trail from Bodmin to Wadebridge, leaving at the old bridge for Port Isaac, a beautiful Cornish fishing village and location for TV’s Doc Martin.  Continue north on the clifftop road, then join the B-road to Delabole, where you turn left and descend to Trebarwith Strand and its gorgeous beach. Continue north through Tintagel, for an unmissable mid-ride snack at Pengenna Pasties. Then it’s on to Boscastle, where you head inland through Camelford to St Tudy. Go left just outside St Tudy, to experience Bodmin Moor and its villages, before picking up the Camel Trail back to Bodmin. Best urban ride: the Taff Trail, CardiffDistance: 32 milesDifficulty: 510Start and finish: Cardiff BayNearest station: Cardiff Central “We’ve had it done up,” the Welsh comedian Rhod Gilbert says when describing Cardiff. And it has been done up, especially the waterfront of Cardiff Bay, where this ride starts. It’s a glorious place to pootle around on a bike. There are plenty of cafes to choose from – but save them for later, when you get back.  The Taff Trail mixes cycle-ways with quiet roads and is well signposted. This ride is 32 miles there and back to Pontypridd, but you can go on to Abercynon in the Rhondda or even do the whole 55-mile-long Taff Trail and reach the Brecon Beacons. The cycle-way sections are ideal for family rides.Best rite of passage ride: the Strines, SheffieldDistance: 22 milesDifficulty: 810Start and finish: LangsettNearest station: Penistone The Strines is 11 miles of unclassified road on the eastern edge of the Peak District, running from Langsett on the A616 to Moscar Fields on the A57. It’s brutal the road plunges into and out of three steep-sided valleys, with plenty of undulations and exposed moorland in between. Head south from Langsett, keeping right at all junctions, to the A57. Turn around and ride back. The Strines both ways is a local rite of passage, and the hills form part of many local training rides. There are six big climbs if you go both ways, ranging between a third and a half a mile long. Oh, and there’s the Bank View cafe in Langsett. It’s very special. Best cafe ride: Selby, West YorkshireDistance: 24 milesDifficulty: 510Start and finish: SelbyNearest station: Selby A pleasant ride through quiet lanes with a cafe stop about halfway. Start at Selby Abbey (fact: the Rt Rev Dr John Thompson is actually known as the Biking Bishop of Selby), find the B1223 and go north then west to Sherburn in Elmet. Elmet was an ancient British kingdom covering much of what is now West Yorkshire. From Sherburn go south to Hillam then Birkin for the cafe, the Birkin Fisheries Tea Room, which stands in its own grounds – there’s a lake, the food is delicious and the service always smiling. Once re-fuelled, head east to West Haddlesey, then north to Gateforth and on, north-east, to Selby.  Distance: 35 milesDifficulty: 910Start and finish: UlphaNearest station: Broughton in Furness Two of the steepest road climbs in the UK – plus others, long and short – give this ride a total altitude gain of 1,800 metres. The first seven and a half miles from Ulpha to Cockley Beck has only one climb, then you are at the foot of Wrynose heading east with the pass before you. Engage your lowest gear and haul yourself over – there’s no way of finessing it.  Descend to Little Langdale, climb over to Great Langdale. Go right in Elterwater, right at the next junction for Wrynose, then clamber over Hardknott Pass. Continue to Eskdale Green and turn left for the long slog over Birker Fell and back to Ulpha. This ride hurts – but the satisfaction of doing it lasts a lot longer than the pain it causes.The quietest: the Cheviot Hills, NorthumberlandDistance: 47 milesDifficulty: 710Start and finish: RothburyNearest station: Alnmouth (for a regular service) Rothbury is a country town like country towns used to be – gentle and homely, where people enquire about a person’s health and actually want to know the answer. The ride is out and back, mostly uphill out and downhill coming back, tracing the River Coquet almost to its source.  Follow the B6341 west from Rothbury. Take the first right after Hepple then keep left all the way to the end of the road, where if you stop for a moment you will probably hear no other evidence of human life but the sound of your own breath. Refuelling at the Barrowburn Tea Room near the turnaround point is highly recommended.The wildest: Ardgour and Moidart, west HighlandsDistance: 81 milesDifficulty: 810Start and finish: Fort WilliamNearest station: Fort William I saved the best till last. Any ride with a ferry crossing starts ticking wild boxes for me, but this gets a lot wilder. It’s mostly on main roads, but they will be the quietest main roads you’ll ever ride. The busiest, the A82, is first, going south-west from Fort William to the Corran Ferry Terminal. Marvel at the mountains as you cross Loch Linnhe. Then it’s on the A861 west through glens, alongside salty sea lochs, over the tip toes of mountains, around the Sound of Arisaig, where the Isles of Rum, Eigg and Muck are grey-green jewels in a sea setting. Finally you’ll head back to Fort William, and in fine weather the whole of Ben Nevis can be seen. Ready to hit the road? Why not make it count?

Algeria has experienced the hottest temperature ever reliably registered in Africa. Britain, meanwhile, has experienced its third longest heatwave, melting the roof of a science building in Glasgow and exposing ancient hill forts in Wales. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said the rising temperatures were at odds with a global cyclical climate phenomena known as La Niña, which is usually associated with cooling.“The first six months of the year have made it the hottest La Niña year to date on record,” said Clare Nullis of the WMO.Taiwan is the most recent place to report a new high with a temperature of 40.3C in Tianxiang on Monday. This followed a flurry of other anomalies.Last week, a weather station at Ouargla in Algeria’s Sahara Desert, reported a maximum temperature of 51.3C on 5 July, the highest temperature reliably recorded in Africa. Even when the sun goes down, night is not providing the cooling relief it once did in many parts of the world. At Quriyat, on the coast of Oman, overnight temperatures remained above 42.6C, which is believed to be the highest “low” temperature ever recorded in the world. Downtown Los Angeles also saw a new monthly July minimum overnight record of 26.1C on 7 July.Globally, the warmest year on record was in 2016, boosted by the natural climate cycle El Niño. Last year, temperatures hit the highest level without that amplifying phenomenon. This year, at the other cooling end of the cycle, is continuing the overall upward trend.Swathes of the northern hemisphere have seen unusually persistent warmth due to strong, persistent high pressure systems that have created a “heat dome” over much of Eurasia.“What’s unusual is the hemispheric scale of the heatwave,” said Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. “It’s not just the magnitude in any one location but that high temperatures are being seen over such a large area.”Northern Russia’s exceptionally sunny weather – seen on TV by billions thanks to the World Cup – has caused wildfires that affected 80,000 hectares of forest near the Krasnoyarsk region, which reported daily anomalies of 7C above average. The Western Siberian Hydromet Center has issued storm warnings after temperatures of more than 30C for five days. Climate watchers fear this will accelerate the melting of permafrost, releasing methane – a far more potent greenhouse gas than CO2.In California, daytime records were also set last week at Chino (48.9C), Burbank airport (45.6C) and Van Nuys airport (47.2C). In Canada, at least 54 deaths have been attributed to the prolonged heatwave and high humidity in Quebec. Montreal saw a new record high temperature of 36.6C on 2 July.In Europe, the WMO has warned of droughts, wildfires and harvest losses after the second hottest June on record. Over the past two weeks, records have been set in Tbilisi (40.5C), Shannon (32C), and Belfast (29.5C) Britain has cooled slightly in the past two days, after 17 days of temperatures over 28C. This was the third longest heatwave on record, following the record 19-day run in 2013 and the famous summer of 1976, when there were two prolonged spells of 18 days and 15 days. Dean Hall of the UK’s Met Office said Britain’s temperatures were forecast to rise again over the coming week.The concern is that weather fronts – hot and cold – are being blocked more frequently due to climate change. This causes droughts and storms to linger, amplifying the damage they cause. This was a factor in the recent devastating floods in Japan, where at least 150 people died after rainfall up to four times the normal level.Paolo Ruti of the WMO said it was difficult to ascribe any one weather event to climate change, but that recent high temperatures, intense rains and slow-moving fronts were in line with forecasts of how rising emissions will affect the climate.“Recent analysis suggests that anthropogenic forcing might indeed affect the characteristics of summer blocking events in the Euro-Asia sector, in particular leading to longer blocking episodes,” he said. Extreme weather events have buffeted much of the world over the past 12months, from the “Day Zero” drought in Cape Town to the abnormally powerful hurricanes Harvey and Irma that buffeted the east coast of the US and Caribbean.  Underscoring the link, a new report from scientists at the World Weather Attribution group indicates that manmade climate change and its effect on rainfall made the recent Cape Town drought three times more likely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02ef60ea78ca8670c844bbada818cbd1d4a8e406/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75263c16896902a462d3e771081f0aff","title":"hiking african american racism nature","story":"Three African American hikers describe fears and stereotypes they have faced – and why they love hitting the trailsA few years ago, a white friend suggested we go on a hike. All the fears I had about being in nature hit me in the face. It’s a very real fear for black people, especially those from urban communities, that bad things happen to black people in the woods, like lynching. It’s something that you see again and again when you look at the history of the civil rights movement and slavery: black people going into the woods and not coming back.My friend had grown up hiking. I talked to her about my fears and she respected my apprehension. I said to myself: “You’ve got to do this now or it will never happen.”I grew up in kind of a rough neighborhood on the south side of Chicago, so my mother kept us in a lot. Our house was across the street from a public park but it was rife with gang violence so we never went there.I always knew about hiking and camping from commercials and magazines. But the people doing it didn’t look like me. They were white, athletic and attractive. I’d never, ever seen anybody of color doing it, let alone a black male I associated the outdoors with whiteness. Nobody around me even thought about it. My mother grew up in the backwoods down south, but she never encouraged us to have a connection with nature.My friend and I headed to Starved Rock state park, two hours south of Chicago. We had to drive through this very wooded area and I remember thinking: “I hope nothing happens. I hope I don’t have to get out of the car.” When we started the hike, I had to let go of a lot of what I was feeling. An hour into it, we stopped to take in this view and I was amazed by everything I was experiencing. I loved not hearing the commotion of the city. No cars, no yelling, no arguments on the corner. Just the water, the birds and the wind. It was like a reset button. I remember thinking, “Why haven’t I been doing this all along? Everybody should be doing this. There’s nobody that shouldn’t be hiking!” It was overwhelming to realize that something I’ve always believed isn’t for me actually is. I had spent so much time being nervous about it when it was what I needed.I now go seven to eight times a month. Five days a week I work in sales, spending my time in ginormous condo buildings and busy infrastructure. As soon as I hop in the car to get out of town, the weight of the week lifts. I take my six-year-old daughter so that she knows earlier than I did that this is something beneficial. I let her lead the way on our path and allow her to make decisions for what she’s doing in nature. My mom’s proud of me but I’m still working on getting her out for a hike.Follow Aaron at @MidwestColorCampI grew up in a small town in North Carolina where most of the white people were farm owners and the black people were hired hands. My family farmed and as a child, I spent a lot of time topping tobacco and picking cucumbers, peppers and squash. We’d go out fishing and hang out on the rivers as a family but we were never encouraged to go far from the house. The feeling was that if you went out into the woods by yourself – and you’re black – if no one’s around, you might not end up coming back.The world has changed but that thought pattern is still there. Today, I’m the first African American chapter chair for the Sierra Club in the state of Virginia. It started because a friend took me to a local meeting and I walked in and there were all these old white people. I said, “OK, there has to be some other representation here.” Some people might have walked away but I think my background makes me a little different. Thirty-nine years ago I became a software developer when there were no black people, let alone women, in that industry, so I’ve always had to go a step above. Back then, all the guys smoked in the office and I didn’t, so I went home and practiced how to do it without coughing.But even now in my position as chair, I will still only go on hikes when I’m with a group of people I know. I live within walking distance of a nature trail and I would never go there by myself. It’s not the younger generation but the older generation that you see that look at you like you have no business there. Like you don’t belong. It’s like: “Get out. Get away.” Even though it’s public land, some people are like, “I’m white and therefore I have more rights and I’m better than you.” And some black people still think, “I’m black and if I’m out there, I’m supposed to be cleaning up or waiting on you.” Sometimes when I introduce myself to groups across the state, I have to take a deep breath because I’ll think: “Are these people going to respect me?”What I love about hiking and the outdoors is breathing that clean air and seeing the greenery around me and not hearing cars. Fresh air really energizes me. Part of that is probably because I was born and raised in the country. I don’t even want to think about my three-year-old great-grandson growing up in a world where he doesn’t know what a real river or real group of trees look like. I hate to think of him never ever seeing a live rabbit or squirrel or deer. I spend a lot of time talking to people about the future and keeping the planet livable.Within the Sierra Club, everyone is seriously nice, but understanding things from a different perspective is missing sometimes. I mean, why would a guy living in a $500,000 house know what it feels like to live in a place that you rent for $500 a month and the environmental issues that go with that? That people are just dumping trash in your neighborhood? A lot of older white people don’t know how to communicate with a black person of the street and the same the other way around. The older generation needs to be more embracing and think about how other people feel.My first trip to a national park was life-changing. It was four years ago and I went with some friends to Yosemite. I was getting over a breakup at the time. While there, I met Shelton Johnson, a black park ranger and writer. We got into a discussion about how there aren’t a lot of African American families visiting national parks. It made me sad because as a kid I would have loved to have seen Yosemite. That first trip, I pushed myself and my friends to do a strenuous hike I wasn’t expecting us to complete it but we did and when we got to the top, standing above a waterfall, just looking out on the valley, it made the whole breakup seem so small in comparison to everything that’s out there to explore.After Trump became president, I became a little nervous about traveling in the US. Racism became more overt. Just after the inauguration I went with a couple of friends to western Arizona. On the way, we passed lots of gun stores, some with Confederate flags, and I felt very uncomfortable. When we got there I mostly felt OK because I was with friends who blended in, but there was this one old man who stared at me from the other side of the street. He was eating an ice cream and wearing a Make America Great Again hat. I felt challenged and stared back until he looked away.My boyfriend and I have been together for two and a half years. This January, to celebrate our anniversary, we went on our first official road trip as a couple. He’s white and I’m black, and when we’re hiking in the LA area, I don’t even think about that. But this trip we were heading to Death Valley national park, in a relatively conservative area.On the trails we received nothing but stares. People just wouldn’t stop. They weren’t mean or evil but at some point I said to my boyfriend: “I don’t want to hold your hand any more.” I felt bad because he was being affectionate and wanted to hug and kiss my cheek but I was like: “No, not here.” I didn’t want to make anyone else uncomfortable, even though I was.I feel like it’s important for black girls to hike. When I was young I would have loved to have had someone encouraging me to get outside. To not be afraid. I’ve decided to apply for a master’s degree in parks and recreation management, and a friend and I set up a hiking group for women of color in LA called Black Girls Trekkin’. I want to be a model to other young girls.If you have an outdoors experience you’d like to share with the , please write to us at publiclands@the"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1002c9e6ec574ef5315c9086b0dd30752a3e429f/0_44_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acb1dfbd2d9c2014d6caf77193f7981e","title":"summer 1993 review moving childhood loss","story":"The debut feature from Spanish writer-director Carla Simón is a finely crafted portrait of personal upheavalA deeply personal child’s-eye view of loss, Summer 1993 is an utterly beguiling debut feature from Spanish writer-director Carla Simón. And the fact that this collection of delicately observed fragments from a summer of upheaval is based on her own life gives an added potency to this finely crafted film.Following the death of her mother from Aids, six-year-old Frida (Laia Artigas) is an orphan. Shell-shocked and unresponsive, she loiters on the edge of the adult world as her extended family pack up the contents of her home in Barcelona. Simón’s use of locked shots here is eloquent – evocative of snapshots in a family album, it also means that the adults and their voices are frequently out of the frame, adding to the sense of Frida’s isolation.Frida’s new home will be with her mother’s brother Esteve (David Verdaguer) and his wife Marga (Bruna Cusí) in rural Catalonia. For a city kid, the joyful mess of country life takes some getting used to, as does the fact that she now has a younger sister, Anna (Paula Robles). Almost as soon as she starts to come out of her shell, Frida begins to build walls: “I have a lot of dolls because everyone loves me,” she says, reassuring herself as much as anyone else. “And you mustn’t touch them,” she adds to Anna.Rather than a linear story, Simón structures the film as a collection of memories. Small incidents – the way the benevolent smiles of the local mothers disappear when Frida cuts her knee (she is being tested for HIV) ham-fisted sympathy from strangers – are magnified through Frida’s eyes. Simón’s work with all the actors is meticulous, but the children in particular are directed with an exemplary lightness of touch. Artigas’s unaffected naturalism reminded me a little of Ana Torrent in Víctor Erice’s Spirit of the Beehive. One scene in particular stands out: it’s a moment of giddy silliness, a pillow fight. Frida is giggling helplessly. And then suddenly, she’s not. Huge, wrenching sobs convulse her. It’s such a sad, wise insight into the way children process grief, the way happiness and mourning can coexist. It destroyed me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/199e8bdba8cf5c72f7e7f76e7adebc537a61b9b7/112_0_4557_2735/master/4557.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33326888cb23771afaa2c19851627954","title":"maurizio sarri jorginho chelsea manager antonio conte sacked","story":"Chelsea have confirmed the appointment of Maurizio Sarri as their new head coach with the Napoli midfielder Jorginho joining his former manager at Stamford Bridge after sealing his move.The midfielder has been unveiled by Chelsea after they agreed a fee of €57m (£50.4m). Jorginho has signed a five-year deal at the club, with Sarri agreeing a three-year contract to replace Antonio Conte.“I look forward to starting work and meeting the players on Monday ahead of travelling to Australia, where I will be able to get to know the squad and begin our match action,” Sarri told the club’s official website. “I hope we can provide some entertaining football for our fans, and that we will be competing for trophies at the end of the season, which is what this club deserves.”Jorginho has said he is “absolutely ecstatic” to have joined Chelsea. “It is not easy to become part of such a big team so I am very, very happy,” he said. “I am excited to play in such an intense league, for a team that gives everything to play and win.”The 26-year-old, born in Brazil and capped by Italy, arrived in London on Friday evening to complete his transfer. Manchester City had appeared favourites to sign the central midfielder, but Chelsea agreed a deal with Napoli for both player and manager.“We are delighted to welcome Maurizio and are looking forward to him bringing his football philosophy to Chelsea,” the club director Marina Granovskaia said.“Maurizio’s Napoli side played some of the most exciting football in Europe, impressing with their attacking approach and dynamism, and his coaching methods significantly improved the players at his disposal.“We are delighted Jorginho has chosen to join Chelsea. He was one of the most coveted midfielders in Europe and will become an important member of the squad.”Sarri replaced Conte, who left his job on Thursday. Chelsea confirmed Conte’s departure on Friday with a 52-word statement.Negotiations to release Sarri from his Napoli deal took some weeks to conclude. He was replaced there by Carlo Ancelotti in late May but was not released from his contract, forcing Chelsea to pay a fee to secure him.

France have powered their way to the World Cup final, where they will start as favourites against Croatia in Moscow, and it is to their credit that it will be a fifth major final in 20 years. Yet the journey to the point where a nation can dream was ignited by the nightmare of the last of them.The countdown to Croatia has been illuminated by French confessions and they have zeroed in on the final of Euro 2016. It was meant to be France’s tournament and not only because they were the host and after they beat Germany in the semi-final they thought the job was done. Portugal would be a pushover in the final. As everybody knows, it did not turn out that way. Portugal won 1-0.Olivier Giroud talked of how Didier Deschamps’ team had been “a bit euphoric” after the Germany game while Samuel Umtiti also indicated where it went wrong. “We know what we didn’t do well at the Euros and what we shouldn’t do again,” he said. “The coach has talked to us and warned us not to be overconfident.”It was left to Paul Pogba to spell it out. “At the Euros we thought we\u0026nbsphad already won it before the final,” the midfielder said. “When we beat Germany, we thought it was\u0026nbspthe final. We thought we’d won the final before playing it, which was\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspmistake.”By any reckoning the admissions have been remarkable and they have shone a light on the psyche of Deschamps’ players. On one level the sky-high self-assurance might not be all bad, showing – as it did – the complete absence of doubt. These are high-level performers, who have a clear sense of their worth.A related question concerned the timing of the comments. Would the players have been so open before, say, their first game at this World Cup, in which they scraped past Australia? They have felt empowered by the fact they have reached another final and they can now say why it will be different this time. Perversely it shows them in a more focused light.“It’s true that after the Germany semi-final we were too happy,” Matuidi said. “We still think about it and we have to use this experience for Sunday. We will prepare differently. It was a good lesson.”The transition from the low of Portugal to the high they now feel has been pronounced and, for much of the time, fraught. Deschamps has been stalked by criticism of his team’s playing style – where was the identity? - while he oversaw bold calls in qualification and when he named his 23-man squad for Russia.Out went 14 of his players from the Euros and in came a crop of youngsters, many of whom were untested. Deschamps was not influenced by previous loyalties or by where some of his players were playing – witness the exclusion of Manchester United’s Anthony Martial and Arsenal’s Alexandre Lacazette. It was Deschamps striking out on his own, selecting a group that would, primarily, work for him and each other.Before the finals France were not among the favourites and, after three uninspiring group games, in which Deschamps described his team’s efforts as “laborious”, the knives were out. Had they lost to Argentina in the last 16, a section of the French media would have called for Deschamps to go.Argentina was where it all changed. Deschamps had arrived at a system for the second group tie against Peru, when France won 1-0, in which Pogba was asked to curb his natural flamboyance alongside N’Golo Kanté in central midfield, Matuidi worked off the left and Antoine Griezmann and Giroud did likewise in central attacking areas. The free role was granted to the 19-year-old prodigy, Kylian Mbappé, on the right.Deschamps stuck with it against Argentina and, with Mbappé running riot on the counterattack, France won 4-3. They have not looked back, with Deschamps’ tactics looking similarly balanced against Uruguay in the quarter-final and Belgium in the semi-final.Belgium did not like it, with the goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois of Chelsea, accusing Deschamps of “anti-football”. The style is certainly reactive and, in the Belgium game, it led to Griezmann and Giroud dropping deep to harass the deep-lying midfielders, Axel Witsel and Mousa Dembélé. Yet the fact is that France have been in control of each of their knockout ties.“Does Courtois think that he plays Barcelona football at Chelsea?” Griezmann chided. “I don’t care how – I just want a second star to be on our shirt.” Umtiti added: “We don’t have anything to answer. What’s important for us is to be qualified and now to win the final. When you win, you don’t talk about second or third.”Mbappé has thrilled at his breakout tournament, particularly against Argentina and Belgium, and the praise has been fulsome. Pogba described him as “one of the most talented players France has ever had”. But the reason for the team’s progress has been the miserly defensive unit – and that extends to Pogba and Kanté in front of the back four and Matuidi in his narrow role on the left. France have never lost a game in which Pogba and Kanté have started.Hugo Lloris has been arguably the goalkeeper of the tournament, making decisive early saves in most of the matches, yet the linchpin has been the centre-half, Raphaël Varane. At the 2014 World Cup – the first competition of Deschamps’ time in charge – it was Varane who was beaten too easily by Mats Hummels for Germany’s winning goal in the quarter-final. That sort of weakness now seems unthinkable in the Real Madrid player.“Varane is a boss,” Pogba said. “He couldn’t have done it in 2014 but now he can. He is only 25 but it feels as though he has been playing at the top level for 20 years.”Deschamps was once derided for being a water carrier – a reference to his sideways playing style – but now he stands to walk on it. The captain of the France team that won the 1998 World Cup, he hopes to become only the third man to win it as a manager, too, following Brazil’s Mario Zagallo and West Germany’s Franz Beckenbauer.Deschamps can be a little snarky, as a Russian journalist found out before the semi-final against Belgium. A theme of the tournament has been the desire of seemingly every local to elicit compliments. What do you think of Russia? What do you think of city X or city Y? In this case Deschamps was asked what he thought of Stanislav Cherchesov’s Russia team. The timing was horrible.“What?” Deschamps replied, brimming with indignation. “Have you just asked me about the Russian national team? Why? I think we should move on.”But Deschamps’ man-management of his squad has been superb and the message from the players is that he has relaxed a little since the Argentina game. “He’s changed after that,” Griezmann said. “The pressure went a bit lower.” The explosiveness of Mbappé and the platform that Deschamps has created for him also gives the manager a degree of insulation against those who would attack him for his pragmatism.“Deschamps has something special – something very few people have,” Pogba said. “He was a great player, a World Cup winner, a captain and he knows how to talk to players, including those who are a bit more timid. We are more mature than we were two years ago and our relationship with Deschamps is changing. He talks to us differently now. He knows what he can tell us and he knows we will understand.”Matuidi mentioned his surprise at how quickly the young players have settled – not only Mbappé but the 22-year-old full-backs, Benjamin Pavard and Lucas Hernández – and Deschamps has to take a portion of the credit for that. The blend of youthful abandon and greater know-how from the senior players has driven France. “Seventy per cent of the job is mental strength,” Giroud said. “Talent alone is not sufficient.”If Euro 2016 has cast its shadows, then the talk has also taken in more positive omens. In 1998 France beat Croatia in the semi-final while they could enjoy the emergence of a jet-heeled forward called Thierry Henry and the selfless work of a non-scoring striker in Stéphane Guivarc’h. For them, read Mbappé and Giroud. Remember how Laurent Blanc would kiss the pate of Fabien Barthez before matches? Now Griezmann touches the moustache of the substitute, Adil Rami.France are fixed on emulating the achievement of that great team and, in the process, chasing away their more recent demons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afd7486c5a6e9188a4b7aaae7472d73ddd2f7bcb/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0c743c20aa27a2ae573ec03f64a6403","title":"england team understood power enjoyment","story":"Though they ultimately ran out of legs and ideas, Gareth Southgate’s side reminded us of the importance of having funIt was the morning of the semi-final. He was walking down the street shouting “Come on England!” to no one in particular. Sitting on a nearby bench I raised my hand in solidarity. He saw me, turned round and yelled: “It’s coming home!” I hollered the words back at him and we both laughed. At last I had exchanged the greeting of the summer, one both nonsensical and chock full of meaning, with a complete stranger.It has been a tumultuous couple of weeks back home. There has been lots ‘going on’ besides the football, which may have heightened the hysteria. But from the point Harry Kane turned home the winner against Tunisia England succumbed to football fever at a level not seen since 1996. The flags came out in earnest, not just from a sense of duty. People chucked sickies and themselves off double-decker buses. Watching the games at outdoor screenings became de rigueur and having a half-dozen pints emptied on your head a rite of passage. The shirts sold out, the memes went wild and Harry Maguire’s forehead became the most unlikely fetish since Prince Harry’s ginger beard.At the heart of it all were those three words. But there was some ambiguity as to what exactly was coming home. Yes, there was the World Cup itself. There was a little bit in all of us that thought it might happen – probably not but might. The phrase was an expression of confidence hedged with irony, an expression recognisably English. It meant other things too, though. It expressed an enthusiasm for the football team, a sign of solidarity. These were players with whom we could identify. It was also a nod to times past and a collective happy memory. It evoked summers gone by or maybe just summer itself. Finally, when stripped out of context, “It’s coming home” was straightforwardly silly. It was just fun to say, like “garlic bread?” once was, or “Proper Bo!”A sense of fun was an integral part of Gareth Southgate’s plan for his England team. It was necessary because this was a team who had got to the point where pulling on the three lions had seemed equivalent to donning a shirt made of lead. To throw off the psychodrama of the past decade the team had to remember what had brought themselves to this point in the first place: their love of the game. It was a good way to start again. Back home we recognised a team enjoying themselves. We also saw that, as a result, they were more committed to each other. We saw it on the pitch but also at the dart board or on social media on the back of a unicorn. They seemed to be having a laugh.This fun had a serious point. It was intended as a building block in a platform for winning football matches. Perhaps half of England’s six matches in Russia saw it bear real fruit. The confidence that came from a team relaxed and united helped us not only to edge past Tunisia but steady ourselves late on against Colombia and quite simply cruise past a Sweden team that had been making things difficult for opponents for years. In the end, against Croatia, enthusiasm and commitment showed their limitations. The team ran out of legs and ideas. They were outfought and out-thought (also outplayed a little) by opponents with greater experience. If England want to improve on this memorable run, they will have to offer more.As professionals, footballers will ultimately judge themselves by the medals on their mantelpiece (or inside their air-conditioned trophy rooms). It is arguable, however, that the enjoyment English people got from this World Cup was not in any way invalidated by the fact that we did not win it.Football is a game. That is not to denigrate but celebrate it. A lot of claims were made during the tournament about England’s success, about what it meant or what it might achieve. Most seem a bit of a stretch. One might hope that effective set pieces could bring together the competing sides in a culture war or reunite young with old, but in reality those tensions in our country will have to be resolved by other means. Football cannot bring world peace or resolution to the Brexit negotiations however many inspirational, but yet humble, quotations from the England manager are pinned on the wall.What a game can certainly do, though, is remind us how great it is to have fun. Life is short and much of it is hard. These recent years have been unrelentingly unpleasant. Occasions when you get lost in the moment, when you enjoy only what is around you, are perhaps rarer than they should be. Sport can provide such moments, either through playing or watching. In this World Cup we watched an England team who understood the power of enjoyment and used it to help them achieve an end. For those of us at home and in the stands, we were reminded enjoyment can also be an end in itself.So did football ever reach its final destination? The trophy did not that much is for sure. But for a while, something was definitely coming home. We all felt it and we all enjoyed it. We should remember the power of that simple pleasure in future. And also take more care of our bus stops."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/010297dbd0226a3b8cb8834d3f7f38d1ef1a24fd/0_0_15000_9000/master/15000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8fed506bee1ce89536c0db0261dba46","title":"france croatia four areas where world cup final won lost","story":"Kylian Mbappé and Mario Mandzukic offer very inidual forward threats but the clash of two midfields boasting energy in abundance could be mesmerisingGiven how Croatia struggled to deal with the pace of Raheem Sterling in the first half against England, their biggest problem against France is likely to be handling Kylian Mbappé, who is not merely quicker than Sterling but physically more powerful and far, far more effective in front of goal.The second half of the semi-final offers some encouragement, given how much more compact Croatia became once they stopped chasing an instant equaliser. But France are very unlikely to become as ragged as England did, and they certainly will not keep surrendering possession with a string of aimless long balls.Mbappé at least plays on the right, which means his speed will not be directed at Dejan Lovren and Domagoj Vida. Ivan Strinic is far less cumbersome than either central defender, but it is not clear how fit he is having been forced off against England – and to go off in that game, given how fatigued Croatia were, you had to be properly injured or completely exhausted by the end Zlatko Dalic was in effect operating a triage station from his technical area.The concern for Croatia, though, must be that there have been repeated occasions over the past year or so when Strinic has been isolated, given little defensive support from his left-winger Ivan Perisic. Whatever happens, Croatia cannot allow Mbappé to get a run at Strinic with space behind him.Sometimes asymmetric teams balance out. In France’s semi-final against Belgium, say, the tendency for Mbappé to play much higher on the right than Blaise Matuidi does on the left of France’s 4-2-3-1 meshed with the Belgian structure, in which Jan Vertonghen sat deep at left-back, denying Mbappé space to run into, while Nacer Chadli, a midfielder playing at full-back, pushed high on the Belgian right. That is not the case in the final.It is not just that Strinic could be exposed by Perisic, it’s that the France right-back Benjamin Pavard – who got forward to make it 2-2 against Argentina – can be exposed by Mbappé (albeit in a system that is far more cautious than Croatia’s).The contrast in styles is less marked for Croatia but just as Matuidi offers balance for Mbappé by tucking in on the French left, so Ante Rebic’s defensive work gives Perisic licence. The wide man is averaging 3.8 fouls per game, more than anybody else at the World Cup, an indication of the enthusiasm with which he presses.Croatia prospered in the second half against England by getting their full-backs forward to support the attack. With Perisic and Rebic forcing Kieran Trippier and Ashley Young back, England struggled for width high up the pitch, which placed an intolerable workload on the three-man midfield – in retrospect, it probably would have made sense for Southgate to have shifted Sterling wide in a 5-4-1 and to have tried to staunch the flow down the flanks.It was, ultimately, Sime Vrsaljko’s cross that brought Perisic’s equaliser. Although Chadli, in the first half at least, found a surprising amount of space getting forward from right-back for Belgium, it seems unlikely Matuidi will be so stretched again, unless Croatia really dominate in central midfield.Paul Pogba has had an excellent tournament. He has not been flashy, he has not been sidetracked into needless tricks – he has not even played with the obvious sense of chafing at restraints he did at the Euros two years ago.This has been a disciplined Pogba – helped no doubt by N’Golo Kanté’s extraordinary energy all around him and the presence of Matuidi to protect his left flank – and he has been a key factor in an efficiently pragmatic structure. But this is his greatest test as he comes into direct confrontation with Luka Modric, who has been central to everything Croatia have done.At this World Cup, nobody has run further than Modric’s 63km. No Croat has scored more goals than Modric. No Croat has played more passes. No Croat has played more through-balls. He has completed 2.7 key passes per game, almost double the next highest figure for a Croatian. Only Rebic has dribbled more. In the squad, only Marcelo Brozovic has completed more passes of players who have started more than one game. It is not the case that if you stop Modric you stop Croatia, but if you can negate him, you gum up their system.Mario Mandzukic is an extraordinary player, embodying the spirit in this Croatia team that makes victory in the final against a side that should be far fresher just about plausible. Against Russia in the quarter-final and against England, he was clearly shattered, but dragged himself to his limits, pressuring the opposing defence and having the alertness to steal behind John Stones to score the winner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/211db5549bfbe685eb08bf59bb35cf04468a7b16/0_8_2995_1797/master/2995.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=870df7095fb79f435d94bdea65acc721","title":"kylian mbappe world cup young player","story":"France’s Kylian Mbappé is a shoo-in and three Uruguayans, one Nigerian and an England player also make our teamAwarded for the first time in 2006, Fifa’s best young player award is usually a hotly contested prize to honour the best player aged 23 or under. This time, however, there is surely no contest.Kylian Mbappé does not celebrate his 20th birthday until December but the France forward has been an undoubted star of the 2018 World Cup and will surely follow in the footsteps of the 2006 winner, Lukas Podolski, Thomas Müller in 2010 and France teammate Paul Pogba four years ago by taking the award. But which other eligible players have excelled in Russia? We select an XI of young stars.As one of only two goalkeepers under the age of 23 to have featured, the other being Tunisia’s Mouez Hassen, the teenager makes the cut almost by default but will still be relatively satisfied with his first major tournament despite Nigeria’s group-stage exit. Uzoho was largely helpless to prevent any of the four goals he conceded in the defeats by Croatia and Argentina and will surely improve with age. The next step for him is to gain first-team experience at Deportivo La Coruña, having spent the majority of last season in the reserves.Three goals in three World Cup matches is a record of which any striker would be proud, so to manage it as a defender is quite an achievement. Mina formed a powerful defensive unit with Davinson Sánchez, who is unlucky to miss out on selection after an impressive tournament. But Mina’s headers in the matches against Poland and Senegal and the last‑minute equaliser against England means he edges it. Everton are among the clubs interested in him if Barcelona deem him surplus to requirements.Playing alongside Diego Godín for club and country has helped to make him one of the best young defenders in the world, with a series of outstanding performances in Russia cementing that reputation. The last-minute goal against Egypt kickstarted Uruguay’s impressive campaign and his tears before the end of the defeat against France in the quarter-final will be an abiding memory of the 2018 tournament. Giménez is closing in on 50 caps despite not celebrating his 24th birthday until January.It was a cruel way for one of the outstanding young performers at the tournament to bow out. The deflection off Emil Forsberg that sent Sweden into a quarter‑final meeting with England at Switzerland’s expense was just about the only foot Akanji put wrong in his four matches in Russia and he looks set to have a successful career after moving to Borussia Dortmund in January for around €18m from his Swiss club Basel. A powerful figure with great timing in the tackle, he was outstanding in the 1-1 draw against Brazil.A relative unknown before the tournament, the Stuttgart defender has proved invaluable to France and capped his performances with a superb goal from outside the area against Argentina in the last 16. With doubts over the fitness of Djibril Sidibé, the 22‑year‑old has provided a solid base on the right flank and has allowed Kylian Mbappé to thrive in attack. Signed from Lille for only £4m in 2016 he is thought to be attracting attention from Manchester City, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, with the fee now likely to be north of £30m.Arsenal’s £22m signing from Sampdoria started the World Cup on the bench but his performance against Russia in the third group-stage match persuaded Óscar Tabárez he was worthy of a starting place. An all-round midfielder capable of influencing play in either box, the 22-year-old from Fray Bentos arrived in Europe three years ago and made more than 100 appearances in Italy. His performance in the last-16 win over Portugal – including one tackle that saw him shrug Cristiano Ronaldo off the ball – was simply outstanding.Earmarked as a future star of world football since he was included in the deal that involved Juventus selling Carlos Tevez to Boca Juniors in 2015, the cultured midfielder came of age during this tournament in Russia with a series of impressive performances at the heart of Uruguay’s talented team. With the full range of passes and an elegant playing style it seems only a matter of time before Betancur becomes a regular for Juventus having made 20 league appearances last season for the Serie A title winners.The Atlético Madrid player has established himself as a dependable presence in Les Bleus’ defence, filling a more orthodox left-back position in Didier Deschamps’ lop-sided formation. It has worked a treat as France have conceded only four goals, thanks in no small part to his speed and agility that augments a formidable backline led by Barcelona’s Samuel Umtiti and Raphaël Varane of Real Madrid. Hernandez signed a lengthy new contract with Atlético before the tournament and has been earmarked as Godín’s long-term replacement.Outstanding in the opening victory against Germany when his goal derailed the World Cup holders, Lozano was a constant threat for Mexico despite their failure to repeat that surprise start as the tournament progressed. His pace caused problems for every opponent and showed just why the 22-year-old is tipped to leave PSV Eindhoven this summer. A return of 17 goals and eight assists last season reportedly led Manchester United to make contact over a potential move for the player nicknamed “Chucky”.Considering he is three years younger than many players on this list, the achievements of France’s new superstar have been astonishing. From the barnstorming run from the edge of his own box to win his side a penalty against Argentina to the improvised skill from kick-off against Belgium that left Jan Vertonghen for dead, Mbappé has thrived in the knockout stages and looks already like a leading contender to win the Ballon d’Or. His club future could yet take him to Real Madrid as a replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo, although it seems clear Mbappé will succeed wherever he plays.A controversial selection in the eyes of many England fans who criticised his performances during the group stages, Sterling showed glimpses of his true ability against Colombia before shining against Sweden and Croatia. Even if a lack of end product remains a major concern, the 23-year-old’s pace and skill provided a crucial outlet for Gareth Southgate’s side that was sorely missed after he was withdrawn in the semi-final. But he now faces a challenge from Riyad Mahrez for his place in the Manchester City side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57ba5b62079e31bab9fb100939aa5f35a2d7c9d2/238_143_3231_1938/master/3231.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81eee5a5aeb40f0e95cea5f39e37a6d0","title":"russia world cup barney ronay fifa england belgium","story":"The walls are shaking. Fireworks pop. In Samara, where England have just beaten Sweden in the quarter-finals, Sunday morning is gripped by the final knockings of Saturday night. Russia and Croatia are playing in the late game and I’ve stumbled back from the stadium to the bar at the bottom of my apartment tower. Here the mood is a mix of head-clutching hysteria and almost parodic Russian stoicism. As Croatia score the winning penalty everyone just wanders off without a word. Three hours of sleep later I’m off to Moscow via a connection in Mineralnye Vody, a dry, dusty place somewhere near Georgia. But not before taking in the breakfast options at the airport. “Dried Horse” says the sign above slices of brown matter being sold by weight. Well, it’s honest. Up front. And a bit salty.England are in the semi-finals. Semi-final in the England are. Semi‑England final are in the. No matter how you phrase it, the day is still spent trying to accommodate this state of affairs. That’s my excuse for what follows, anyway. This is the night of my  colleague Jonathan Wilson’s birthday dinner. My job is to turn up with the embarrassing surprise cake complete with candles and sparklers. I find a football‑themed one in between tapping out 1,400 words on England. I’m at the restaurant 10 minutes late. Except, no one else is here. They have no record of a Wilson booking. Hmmm. Oh. Checking the long chain of emails I realise that we’re actually meeting at a restaurant by the same name in … St Petersburg. I’m in Moscow, a mere 450 miles away.Well, we’ve all done it. I send Wilson a picture of the cake from around the corner where my colleague Stuart James and I have a final farewell Moscow meal. Four weeks ago we turned up clueless in a foreign city with no idea about Russia. Now here we are clueless in a foreign city with a very small idea about Russia. What a journey it’s been.And so to the Luzhniki Stadium for England’s final press conference before the semi. It has been fun seeing the evolution of Gareth Southgate from likeable, slightly gauche former player to dreamboat, sage and all-round mainstream star. The press room falls into a hush at his approach. Cameras whirr, necks are craned. Gareth looks immaculate, poised, in control, all the more notable because by this stage the travelling press are starting to fray and moulder – four weeks of bad meals on the hoof and declining levels of personal grooming have taken their toll.By the end of this week, I will have seen not one but two of my Observer football colleagues attempt to launder their clothes using dishwasher tablets. And not carefully disguised dishwasher tablets. Dishwasher tablets with “dishwasher tablets” written on them. Neither Stuart James nor Nick Ames would appreciate me naming names at this stage, so I will keep quiet on exactly who.Nothing happened on Wednesday.OK, one or two things happened. England played their semi-final, a 9pm start that left an endless amount of day to get through in Moscow. Key to this was the purchasing of appropriate snacks for the late kick‑off. The local supermarkets in Arbat are astonishingly good, with entire Serrano hams, a million kinds of cheese and lovely friendly staff who humour you even when you have no idea what you’re doing and have just wandered along to get a little bit of that great supermarket vibe. Later, England will go down 2-1 in extra time to a manically committed Croatia. Football is not coming home in any triumphalist-open-bus-ride kind of way. It never really was. But it has been a ride.A wander down to Gorky Park to see Qatar’s World Cup 2022 installation, which turns out to be a frightening black cube moored on the river with flashing lights and spacey installations. Moscow tends to throw up these strange sights in any case. It is a city of vast, striking buildings, with a warm, occasionally hidden, street life. Even the long, thin park by the seven-lane highway outside our apartment seethes with activity. In the evening the courting couples appear: teenagers who sit on the benches, talk chastely, hold hands and enjoy the dusk. By 1am the nightshift is in: shoeless drunks and groups of homeless people, who use the benches for sleeping quarters. There is an integration between the various groups. At breakfast time local babushkas sit on benches opposite the grimy hungover men and eat their buns. Then as dusk falls the teenagers are back and the place is transformed again into a little touch of 1950s small-town America. I have to say nobody mentioned any of this in all the pre-tournament stuff about being punched, bugged and imprisoned.The World Cup is dying. At this stage even the stadium staff look exhausted. The journalists wander like late-stage George Romero zombies, babbling about flights and escape routes. In Moscow the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, turns up to his final press conference dressed ostentatiously in a World Cup volunteer hoodie. Infantino receives £1.4m a year plus perks for running football. Russia’s volunteers are unpaid. No prize for guessing which one has made the last month a pleasure to travel around and been relentlessly patient and helpful. (Clue: it’s not the bald Swiss bloke banging on about how he has personally overseen “the best World Cup ever”.)Third‑place day. England are in St Petersburg to play Belgium. I’m in Moscow for the final, with a chance to do that rare thing: actually watch an England match while not tapping wildly away at a laptop to a deadline. It turns out they actually have second halves to these things. Who knew? It is just France v Croatia to go from here. It has been a wonderful, massive-scale World Cup, but with a feeling of end times, too. On now to the winter absurdity of Qatar in four years ..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/942ac16388e4ac170a8be475682754f6e8d921c4/0_70_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0ead6a55c74d8956976314f0f4c29e1","title":"we can share in the joy world cup unites croatia and australian diaspora","story":"Footballing prowess brings together Croatians from far and wide, giving some a snapshot of life there since independence in 1991After Ivan Rakitic scored the third goal in Croatia’s group-stage win over Argentina, Jozo Kolakusic, a 25-year-old Australian-born Croatian, threw his arms around his father at the Nizhny Novgorod Stadium. Together they sang patriotic songs and shed tears of joy.Since then, as Croatia defeated Iceland, Denmark, Russia, and England to qualify for the country’s first World Cup final, the emotion and sense of expectation has been building to a crescendo. “I hope to God this feeling lasts as long as possible,” says Kolakusic, who has shuttled back and forth between Croatia and Russia throughout the tournament.For many Australians of Croatian heritage, Rakitic is a symbol of unity between them – members of the Croatian diaspora – and the Croatian people. Born in Switzerland, Rakitic played for Swiss youth teams before deciding to represent Croatia.“We feel like he is one of us,” says Katarina Jusup, a 34-year-old football fan from Melbourne, who is on holiday in Croatia with her husband and three young sons. “We feel like we can share in the joy, even though we are not living in Croatia. “My boys are very much caught up in it. They are playing on the concrete fields here and saying things like, ‘Ivan Rakitic was born in Switzerland and he plays for Croatia, so we can play for Croatia when we grow up’.” Since Croatia declared its independence in 1991, causing thousands of Croatian immigrants to return home for regular holidays or to live permanently, there has at times been an observable difference between the natives and the diaspora. Australian Croatians, in particular, are often inculcated with extreme levels of patriotism and idealism. “It’s kind of like we’re stuck in a time warp, whereas they’ve moved on,” admits Jusup. This has been true for Kolakusic, who moved from Melbourne to Zagreb in late 2016. At times he has struggled to reconcile the image of Croatia in his mind with Croatia as it really exists: a nation still recovering from the conflicts of the 1990s and with ongoing problems such as corruption, a dysfunctional bureaucracy, and high levels of youth unemployment. “Moving to Croatia wasn’t what I expected it to be,” says Kolakusic. “Croatians can’t get their head around the fact that someone would leave a first-world country like Australia to move to Croatia, where not everything functions as it should.  “In Croatia, all you see is bad news stories. Of course that translates to young people. They don’t have any hope, they’re just pessimistic, they don’t see that they can change the future themselves. And all of a sudden there is this wave of positivity … you see people being nice to each other on public transport, you see people looking after each other, you see people smiling. People finally have hope – it’s a Croatian renaissance.” Growing up in Australia, Kolakusic supported Melbourne Knights, which was established in 1953 as Melbourne Croatia. For decades, football clubs such as these were the most visible expression of the Croatian diaspora’s commitment to their homeland. Virtually every Croatian club in Australia was founded as “Croatia” and still plays in red jerseys, white shorts, and blue socks.  While Australian Croatians are welcoming the attention of newspaper reporters and breakfast television programs, in Croatia and Russia the symbols of their community are everywhere. During the wild celebrations that followed Croatia’s semi-final victory over England, one fan in Zagreb held a North Geelong Warriors flag aloft as people marched happily along Tkalčićeva Street to the main square while Kolakusic has spotted the logos of clubs such as Hurstville Zagreb, Sydney United, Strathmore Split, and of course Melbourne Knights. “This is definitely something that is unifying the diaspora and the people that are native to Croatia — this is something we can jointly get behind,” says Jusup, whose father is a long-serving president of the Melbourne Knights, and whose husband is the current president. For Sunday’s final, too, the Australian Croats will continue to make their presence felt. While Jure Dragovic is in Melbourne, many of his friends have already made the pilgrimage back to their homeland. “There are about 30 people I know who have ‘dropped tools’, so to speak, and have arrived in Zagreb just to be able to watch the game,” says Dragovic.  For those who can’t get to Croatia, there will be a crowd of thousands at the Melbourne Croatia soccer club, the Croatian Catholic church in Sunshine, and other Croatian community centres around Australia. Patriotic songs such as Lijepa Li Si, Moja Domovina, and Malo Nas Je Al’ Nas Ima will be sung just as loudly in Sydney or Melbourne as they are in Zagreb, Split, or Moscow. “This is not just about football, it’s about changing Croatia’s collective psyche,” says Kolakusic, who will watch the final with his father in Zagreb. “Something like this lifts the spirit of the entire nation. People inside and outside the country are breathing as one: we’re all just Croats and we want to win.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c4b437bce845f4c5e9747546ab8b76ffc6f4bc3/378_247_3803_2282/master/3803.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c202573cd800b95650a729b17d135316","title":"world cup final france croatia modric 2018","story":"Croatia’s success has been built on extremely hard work with a sprinkle of Modric magic and I hope they go all the wayBefore the World Cup started I do not think I was alone in thinking that one of Brazil, Germany, Argentina or possibly France would be in the final. France have made it but I think very few would have guessed that Croatia would be their opponents.It has been great watching Zlatko Dalic’s team this World Cup and one thing that stands out is their extreme work-rate. Croatia have some star players, of course they do, but this has been all about the team. Luka Modric, Ivan Rakitic and Mario Mandzukic are important players who play for important teams in Europe but I would argue that the reason Croatia have reached the final is that the whole team have contributed. The tireless running of Ivan Perisic on the left, for example, or of Sime Vrsaljko at right-back has contributed towards opponents never being able to rest. And we cannot forget the goalkeeper Danijel Subasic, the hero of two shootouts.It also shows that tradition and history does not matter in the end. Russia 2018 has shown us that having a glorious World Cup past does not win you games alone. Teams such as Brazil, Argentina, England and Germany have gone out while Croatia are still there. Croatia, of course, finished third in 1998 but they have struggled at the biggest stage since then.This summer, however, it has all come together. They have had a clear strategy – in contrast to some other teams – and that has paid off. The unity of the squad has been great to see and they have defended as a team, not as iniduals. A solid defence and the knowledge that everyone helps out gives everyone a lot of confidence to go forward.Croatia have been very aware of their opponents’ weaknesses and have targeted them throughout the tournament. Dalic has not been afraid to change or tweak in the middle of games either, something some coaches are wary of doing.It is impossible, of course, to talk about Croatia without a special mention for Modric. He is a wonderful player who is able to do most things you need from a midfielder. He is always calm, which is impressive considering the tempo these games are being played at, and builds the team’s play without any pressure whatsoever.We have seen him run games for Real Madrid for years now, although at the Spanish club he has often been overshadowed by others such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema. But Modric has worked extremely hard to get where he is and he deserves all the praise he gets.Talking about Modric reminds me of a great midfielder who I have played with many times in the past and who I am still fortunate enough to play with for the national team. Her name is Formiga. Her initial position is in defensive midfield but she is so talented that she is extremely good going forward too. She is also very aggressive when she ventures up the pitch, which you need to be, and she is also a very smart player.Being a midfielder you have to combine a lot of different skills to be a complete player and, during all this time that I have played for my clubs and the national team I couldn’t think of another player that has her quality, her vision, her willingness to work hard and her positional sense when it comes to marking her opponents. She is a complete midfielder.But, as I said from the outset, this is all about the Croatia team and their fighting spirit. After the win against England, Modric and a few others spoke about them being energised by the “arrogance” of the English media.Being criticised is never fun but it affects different people in different ways. Croatia took this perceived criticism – namely that they were tired and would not be able to put up a fight against England – and used it to their advantage. Using criticism as a motivator can be very powerful.You could see that every player gave everything they had out on the pitch against England, and it is not impossible that part of that energy came from some of the comments about them before the game. I know from personal experience that it can be the way because the more criticised I get, the more I want to show them that they are wrong, and the more I want to get that result. It motivates me.I do not answer to criticism, unless it is mentioned or asked in an interview, because I look to answer on the pitch. I think criticism is part of being a successful athlete. You have to learn to live with it and use it to your advantage.Croatia take on France – a side that have, in Kylian Mbappé, one of the stars of the tournament. He is a 19-year-old who has the vibrancy of youth and the quality of a world-class star combined with extraordinary speed. He is very hard to stop and has been making the difference for this team.France have a young team that are only going to get better and they are my slight favourites to lift the trophy. But do you know what? I hope I am wrong because I am cheering a bit more for Croatia because they are a team that have never been to a World Cup final and, for all the work they have been putting in, they deserve to win it. It would be fantastic to have a side that have never won the World Cup lifting the trophy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1925766906d686003734bd44dbcd6489b08b99fe/0_153_4602_2761/master/4602.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9103889a2ec520dbb6ae02c5ed4f8c44","title":"englands dreams over as croatia take the next step world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss the end of England’s World Cup dreams, Bond villain defenders, third-place play-offs, West Ham’s transfer approach and FW live"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25a14c55a93f0287184c5526525b326fc512b77f/165_0_2846_1708/master/2846.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbff71a61b7c20989fb823ca702324e4","title":"world cup 2018 belgium v england third place play off live","story":"34 min: The probing concludes with De Bruyne picking out Hazard, who had dashed into the box. Stones flings himself in front of the shot to deflect it out for a corner. 32 min: As if trying to contradict my previous entry, Meunier aims a nothing-cross into the English area. It’s easily cleared. but Belgium regain the ball and resume probing in the manner described.30 min: Belgium enjoy a spell of possession. Their movement and passing is significantly sharper and crisper than England’s are when England have the ball.27 min: Lukaku pounces on a loose ball midway inside the English half. He lays it off to Chadli, who seeks Hazard, who wriggles his way into the English box before knocking it back for Tielemans to have a bang. Tielemans’ shot is charged down (by Stones, I think). 25 min: England have steadied themselves over the last few minutes and played the ball around quite nicely, although you do get the sense that Belgium are happy enough to allow them to do that in innocuous places with a view to nicking it off them and striking on the counter. “About Danny Rose’s socks,” begins J Walker. “I think it’s because they are too tight on the calves so the holes relieve some of the pressure. He had the same look in the last match.”22 min: After good English play, featuring a canny pass by Dier, Sterling tees up Kane, who slashes a bouncing ball wide from 16 yards. 20 min: Maguire towers above Kompany and gets his header to a corner about 10 yards out. It’s straight at Courtois, who again saves easily. “Any idea what’s going on with Danny Rose’s socks?” asks Mark Childs. “I’m transfixed by the holes...” He does have big holes in the back of his socks but I’ve no idea why. Symbolic of the gaps in England’s midfield and defence, perhaps? 18 min: Stones joins an English attack, receiving the ball about 15 yards outside the Belgian box and knocking it on to Delph, who shows nifty foot work to help it on to Sterling. But the third of the Man City players is quickly surrounded by Belgians, who prevent him from turning on the penalty spot and getting off a shot. 17 min: De Bruyne splits England’s defence open with a gorgeous pass through the legs of Dier. Lukaku just fails to collect it after making a smart run behind Trippier.15 min: Kompany pokes the ball off the feet of Kane, who barely been visible so far. Trippier retrieves it wide on the right and crosses quickly to Loftus-Cheek, who meets it with a respectable header from 15 yards. But it had neither the power nor the precision to stretch Courtois. 14 min: Delph has a go from 20 yards, a low, curling effort with his right foot. It’s on target but too weak to trouble Courtois. 13 min: De Bruyne and Hazard again revel in the space where England’s midfield should be, but this time Jones helps out Stones and England manage to stop Hazard’s run at the edge of the area.11 min: Hazard pings a low pass to Lukaku, who sends it on to De Bruyne thanks in part to more jittery English defending. De Bruyne sends a sidefooted shot from 16 yards goalward from the left-hand side of the box. It takes a deflection ... and forces Pickford to show his agility and a strong hand to bat it away! 9 min: A setpiece for England! A freekick to the left, mid-way inside the Belgian half. Trippier curls in an in-swinger. But it’s not one out of the training ground playbook, as it floats well beyond any English player, and Vertonghen nudges it back to Courtois. 7 min: Tripper sends in a reasonable low cross from the right but Belgium clear without fuss.4 min: That was a nicely-constructed goal by Belgian and well finished by Meunier, albeit with his shin. But England’s resistance was very flimsy. There were huge holes in midfield as hazard slashed through it and Rose was caught unaware as Meunier stole in front of him.Meunier pokes home from six yards after a cross from the right by Chadli!2 min: Some bright early play by Rose, wins the ball off De Bruyne and then steads himself and plays a careful pass to Stones, allowing England to begin a bit of possession play.1 min: Three, two, one ... we have kickoff! Belgium, wearing yellow shirts and black shorts, do the honours.“It’ll be interesting to see if Belgium can do the double over England today,” muses Peter Oh. “I’m surprised to see Trippier in the starting lineup. On Wednesday it looked like his legs were practically falling off at the groin. Pickford looks as confident as ever. He doesn’t seem fazed by squaring up against a keeper of Courtois’s stature.” And there’s a fair chance he will literally square up to him at some point.Here come the national anthems, which, in many countries’ cases, tend to be more arrogant and offensive than any tune written by a pair of comedians. “I think the so-called ‘arrogance’ of the English media could be to do with so many people knowing English and the fact that so many other countries follow English social media,” reckons Kate Snowdon. “The first world cup I watched consistently was 1974 when England didn’t qualify and Scotland did. The whole Grandstand team wore tartan rosettes and wanted Scotland to win. I also watched the 1966 cup final at a camp site in France. Very dim memories but my elder sister says that the French wanted the English to win as it was only 20 years after the second world war.”“Regarding commentators, how about the channels offer an option on the remote next tournament?” wibbles Mr Smart. “For example: 1. Wittering Cliche-fest 2. OffStadium ambience 3. Partisan foreign enthusiasm hollering 4.  Disinterested jaded ex-pro ramblings 5. Irritatingly non-partisan rules stickler mutterings.” I note you don’t have an option for fair, remarkably clever, likeable and downright life-affirming chat. Or is that what MBMs are for? After the ITV pundits dismiss Luka Modric’s claim that perceived arrogance by English pundits helped motivated Croatia, Gareth Southgate pops up to give his thoughts on today’s game, stressing that his team have an opportunity to become the highest-achieving England side in a World Cup bot held in Wembley:We have two choices. We play well and finish fourth and go home having shown improvement ... Or we put on a performance and the players go home with a medal and as the best-ever team to have left our shores.Regarding his team selection, he says: “Every player was up for playing . We had to make a decision on some who we didn’t think it was right to start and try to reenergise the team. The mentality has been brilliant.”Following on, sort of, from the previous point, has any seen L’Equipe today? The font page of their magazine is devoted to a photo of the Arc de Triomphe and the caption: “See you Tomorrow”. They’re planning their parades! Someone get Roy Keane on French TV pronto! That front page, meanwhile, is sure to have pride of place in the Croatian dressing room tomorrow ....“Clive Tyldesley aside, it seems to me that most of the UK commentators haven’t been too partisan despite what people have said (co-commentators are a different matter),” reckons David Wall. “It’s odd though that many are so critical of that yet praise and share clips of overseas commentators acting more like supporters than journalists (the minute’s silence on Argentinian TV, the Icelandic guy becoming incoherent, the Panamanians crying at the national anthem, and the increasingly tedious Brazilian commentators saying ‘gol’ for as long as they can, for instance ). Is it because we only ever see short clips so would hate watching entire matches like that? Or perhaps because we don’t understand what they’re saying and are amused by those ‘weird foreigners’?” I agree it would be silly to think English commentators shouldn’t convey happiness if England score or disappointment if they lose. Why shouldn’t they want England to win? The only beef I’d have would if their preference led to dishonesty, leading them, for example, to ignore or excuse fouls or playacting by English players while condemning similar acts by their opponents. And that does happen.Let’s hope Kane and Lukaku prepared for this match by watching the 1958 third-place playoff, when Just Fontaine helped himself to four goals, his 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th of the tournament. Don’t think much of his penalty-shooting, mind. A touch of the Eric Dier’s about his effort here: As you can see from the lineups below, Gareth Southgate has made fivechanges to the side that started that sad defeat by Croatia. Henderson, Lingard, Young, Walker and Alli have all dropped out - at least partly due to fitness worries - while Jones, Rose, Dier, Delph and Loftus-Cheek come in. As for Belgium, they’ve gone strong, with all their main men starting, with Meunier returning at right wingback after missing the semi-final through suspension, and Youri Tielemans coming into midfield in place of Fellaini. Belgium look to have a lot more creativity than England so Lukaku has a fair chance of emulating players such as Toto Schillaci, Thomas Muller and Davon Suker, all of used the third-place playoff to give their Golden Boot push a decisive late boost. Let’s see what Kane can do about that.Hello and welcome to the match that no one dreams of playing in but, now that Belgium and England are here, both will do their utmost to win. Hopefully. For England victory would represent their second-best finish of all time, while for Belgian it would be the country’s biggest footballing achievement ever, and give their golden generation a bronze medal to point to. As for us smile spectators, the third place playoff is usually a treat, since teams tend to play with more abandon than when the stakes are truly high: not since 1974 has one of these affairs failed to produce at least three goals. And let’s not forget that if Romelu Lukaku scores that many today, he could pinch the Golden Boot off poor Harry Kane."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d09a78ef1b146a6f57b5491881d3a1c56910a7a/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1751f5bcc0998f58139de3067647862","title":"blind date emily krishan","story":"What were you hoping for?Leonardo DiCaprio circa 1997.

(If I were Renée Zellweger and all restaurants were Tom Cruise, I would say to them: “You had me at all-you-can-eat.”) But when I arrived, I began the spiel I’ve given waiters for as long as I can remember. “Um, so, I don’t eat meat. Or fish. Or, um...”“No problem! This whole buffet is plant-based and just ask for any non-vegan options,” the waiter said. “Let me know if you have any concerns about gluten, wheat, nuts or soya, OK?”It is heretical for a New Yorker to admit this, but I’m increasingly realising that LA is my spiritual home. There are the obvious things: I’m only truly comfortable when it’s over 20 degrees I actually like it when people tell me to have a nice day I even like traffic jams, because you just sit still and do nothing and no one can call you lazy. But the main thing is the food.From Alvy Singer ordering a plate of mashed yeast in Annie Hall to the LA juice bar owner Amanda Chantal Bacon, who in an infamous 2015 magazine article claimed that one of her favourite foods was “soft and chewy bee pollen”, the laughably self-indulgent eating habits of Los Angelenos have long been one giant yeast-based or yeast-free joke. Ha ha, I’d laugh: pollen! And a secret voice inside me would think, “I wonder if Sainsbury’s sells that yet?”Being a faddy fusspot is the only trend I’ve ever been ahead of the game on. Insisting you can’t eat various major food groups for no real medical reason has become an essential part of looking like a modern, fabulous person. But believe me, this was not always the case. I was four when I announced I was a vegetarian, after discovering that meat was a code word for animals (do other people know this?), and by the age of eight I had ruled out various other foods. Many of my childhood memories involve the mothers of friends looking pained when I came round for a play date – and really, who could blame them? “Here’s meatloaf for everyone, except Hadley, who’s getting crackers with peanut butter. Bon appétit, kids!” Because that’s what it was like being a nine-year-old near-vegan in the 80s.Things are better now, if not perfect, and not everywhere. Recently I ordered a bowl of lentils in a Paris brasserie. They arrived with what looked like a giant femur sticking out of them.“Er, je suis végétarienne,” I said to the waiter.The waiter removed the bone.“Voilà, c’est végétarien,” he replied. And really, who could blame him?Once I was embarrassed about my fussiness because it was a hassle for other people. Now, I’m embarrassed because it’s depressingly similar to the kind of nonsense advocated by self-appointed nutritionists who take photos of themselves drinking a glass of what is apparently pond scum. Everyone knows that the current fad of randomly excluding food groups in the name of “wellness” is just dieting with an Instagram filter. It would be impossible for me not to see a through line from the fussy child I was to the anorexic teenager I became, but when I see people advocating that women exclude dairy, I worry: I know where this road potentially leads, so please don’t encourage others to take it.The complicated truth is that while eating this way paved the way towards my eating disorder, it also got me out of it. As I started to recover, I felt safe putting weight back on by eating in my usual eccentric way – just a lot more of it. Now that I’m healthy, I no longer feel defined by what I (don’t) eat. I am still essentially vegan, and while I can worry about coming across like a cut-price Deliciously Ella until the tofu comes home, at a certain point you just have to know and accept yourself.London is better than – let’s say – Paris at dealing with people like me, and there is almost always at least one thing on a menu I can eat. But sometimes it would be nice for there to be more, and could that one thing not be a stuffed pepper?Enter Los Angeles. LA is like a Disney World for me, a whole city of restaurants with entire menus of food I want to eat, and, sure, you can argue that this is weird, even enabling. All I know is that here I eat more than anywhere else in the world and I feel, for the only time in my life, normal about food.So tonight I’ll go to one of my regular spots, Cafe Gratitude, and the waiter will give me the menu and ask if I would prefer the vegan key lime pie or the dairy-free chocolate brownie for dessert? And I’ll look up at him with my cynical Jewish New Yorker face, smile and think, “At last, I have found my people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d921af1645e297be64bc34d16bba0bac472a5f84/0_517_3639_2183/master/3639.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f215fe31493c87d9f17670bcfd46b606","title":"yotam ottolenghi summer recipes","story":"For a truly seasonal spread, pair garlicky flatbreads with cold cuts, spiced chicken with an Asian salad, and a strawberry-spiked take on a classic Italian puddingToday I am celebrating the season with three dishes that are perfect for summer dining. To keep things light on a hot day, serve these olive oil flatbreads with a selection of cold cuts and salads. You can whip up my strawberry tiramisu cake the day before, then flip it impressively on to a plate so you can enjoy a hassle-free outdoor lunch. And for a vibrant meal-in-one to accompany good wine and conversation, there’s a crunchy, sweet and sharp chicken and egg salad. Three very good reasons to bask in the summer sun.The garlic butter is the star of this dish, combining mellow, slow-roasted garlic, sweet black garlic and pungent raw garlic. The recipe will make more butter than you’ll need for the flatbreads, but it keeps for up to a week in the fridge and is great spread on toast, melted over steak or stuffed into chicken kievs. 200g strong white bread flour1 tsp fast-action dried yeast1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing and drizzlingFlaked sea salt and black pepper120ml lukewarm waterFor the three-garlic butter1 whole head garlic, the top fifth of the bulb cut off to expose the cloves1 small garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped4 cloves black garlic, peeled and roughly chopped100g unsalted butter, softened 10g parsley leaves, finely chopped1½ tsp caraway seeds, toasted and crushedTo serve2 ripe vine tomatoes2 cloves black garlic, peeled and thinly sliced1 tsp picked thyme leaves1 tsp picked oregano leavesHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Put the flour and yeast in a large bowl with a tablespoon of oil and half a teaspoon of salt. Pour in the water and use a spatula to combine. Transfer to a lightly oiled work surface and, with lightly oiled hands, knead the dough for five minutes, until soft and elastic (add more oil if it starts to stick to the surface). Transfer to a large bowl, cover with a slightly damp, clean tea towel and leave in a warm place to rise for about 40 minutes, until nearly doubled in size, then cut into four equal pieces.While the dough is rising, drizzle the head of garlic with a teaspoon of oil and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Wrap tightly in foil and bake for 40 minutes, until the cloves have softened. Discard the foil and, when cool enough to handle, squeeze out the flesh from the papery skins.Put the roast, raw and black garlic in a mortar with a teaspoon and a half of flaked salt and a good grind of pepper. Pound to a rough paste, then put in a bowl with the butter, parsley and caraway, and mix well.Grate the tomatoes on a box grater, discarding the skin, then put the flesh in a sieve set over a bowl.Turn the oven to its highest setting (250C480Fgas 10) and heat a large baking tray on the middle shelf. Transfer the four pieces of dough to a lightly oiled work surface and use your hands to stretch each one into a rough circle about 18cm wide and 5mm thin.Remove the hot tray from the oven and quickly put two flatbreads on it, spacing them well apart. The dough will be very thin, but should have enough elasticity not to break. If you do get a hole, don’t worry: it just adds to the rustic look.Quickly return the tray to the oven and bake for eight minutes, until the dough is golden brown and crisp. Repeat with the remaining dough.Spread each flatbread with a teaspoon of the garlic butter, then top with the drained tomatoes and the slices of black garlic. Sprinkle over the herbs, and finish with a drizzle of oil, a generous pinch of flaked salt and a grind of pepper.I have packed chicken, eggs and potatoes into this to turn a summer salad into a light meal. Play around with the ingredients: green beans, asparagus and peppers will all work as well as the chicken and vegetables listed. 3 tbsp soy sauce2 tbsp maple syrup2 tbsp vegetable oilSalt and black pepper4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed7cm piece fresh ginger, finely grated 6 boned and skinned chicken thighs250g small or medium new potatoes, halved1 small kohlrabi, peeled and very thinly sliced (use a mandoline, ideally)1 cucumber, cut in half lengthways, seeds and watery centre discarded 5 limes – 4 juiced, to get 60ml, and 1 cut into wedges, to serve3 eggs2 tbsp rice-wine vinegar2 tbsp mirin4-5 spring onions, finely sliced into 5cm strips5g coriander leaves1 large red chilli, deseeded and julienned2 tbsp mayonnaise½ tbsp black sesame seedsHeat the oven to 220C425Fgas 7. Put the soy, syrup, oil and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt in a bowl with two teaspoons of crushed garlic and a tablespoon of grated ginger. Cut each chicken thigh into three strips, then toss in the bowl and leave to marinate for 10 minutes. Lay the chicken on an oven tray lined with baking paper, then roast for 30-35 minutes, stirring once, until cooked and golden brown. Leave to cool, then roughly shred with two forks.While the chicken is cooking, put the potatoes and a teaspoon of salt in a medium saucepan, cover with water and bring to a simmer. Cook for 20-25 minutes, until soft but still holding their shape, then drain.Stack the kohlrabi into piles, then cut into 1cm-wide strips and put in a large bowl. Cut the cucumber into 6cm x 5mm batons and add to the bowl. Add the lime juice and half a teaspoon of salt, and toss to coat.Fill a small saucepan with water and put on a medium-high heat. Once boiling, turn the heat to medium, gently lower in the eggs and cook for seven minutes. Drain the eggs and, once cool, peel them.Mix the remaining teaspoon and a half of garlic and two teaspoons of ginger with the vinegar and mirin, and pour over the kohlrabi. Add the spring onion, coriander and chilli, and toss. Stir the mayo into the potatoes and cut the eggs in half. Using your hands – they’ll act as a natural sieve – lift the kohlrabi and cucumber on to a platter with a lip. Top with potatoes, then strew the chicken over. Add the eggs yolk side up, then scatter with the sesame seeds. Sprinkle with a little salt and serve with the lime wedges.This impressive-looking dessert is like a summery tiramisu. It doesn’t cope too well against time or heat, so eat it straight out of the fridge. The espresso adds a grown-up twist, but you can leave it out if you prefer.850g strawberries, hulled135g caster sugar1½ tsp vanilla bean paste1 tbsp orange zest 2 egg yolks50ml sauternes dessert wine80g mascarpone, at room temperature80ml Grand Marnier1 shot (30ml) espresso (optional)150ml double cream140g Savoiardi biscuits (also known as sponge fingers or ladyfingers)Heat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Line a 24cm x 14cm loaf tin with clingfilm, so it drapes over the sides.Cut the larger strawberries into quarters and smaller ones in half.Put 550g strawberries in a 30cm baking dish, then stir in 100g sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla bean paste and two-thirds of the orange zest. Roast for 30 minutes, stirring once halfway, until the strawberries have produced a syrup, then leave to cool.To make a sabayon, whisk the egg yolks, sauternes and 20g sugar in a medium heatproof bowl, then set over a saucepan of simmering water (ensure the base is not in contact with the water). Whisk for four to five minutes, until the mixture resembles a thick, foamy cream, then take the bowl off the pan and leave to cool, whisking once or twice as it does so. Set aside to cool, then mix in the mascarpone using a spatula.In a small bowl or cup, mix the Grand Marnier with the shot of espresso, if using.Put the double cream and the remaining orange zest and vanilla paste in the bowl of a stand mixer and whip to soft peaks – about a minute.Blitz the remaining strawberries with the remaining tablespoon of sugar for 30 seconds.To assemble the cake, pour the roasted strawberries and their syrup into the lined loaf tin. Cover with a row of biscuits, pushing them down so they soak up the syrup. Turn over the biscuits and push them down again, to soak the other side, too. Drizzle half the Grand Marnier mix over the biscuits, then spread the sabayon on top in an even layer. Spread the whipped cream evenly over the sabayon, then pour the blitzed fresh strawberries over the cream. Top with a second layer of biscuits (you may need to cut some in half lengthways to fill in any gaps) and drizzle the remaining Grand Marnier evenly over the biscuits. Push the biscuits into the blitzed strawberries, then turn them over to soak the other side. Pull the clingfilm tightly over the top, and refrigerate for at least five hours, or overnight.To serve, unwrap the clingfilm lid and put a large plate on top of the loaf tin. Hold the plate and tin together, then quickly flip over to invert. Gently lift off the tin: the cake should release itself from the tin and on to the plate if it does not, tap the tin gently until it does. Peel off the clingfilm and serve at once."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

And some want even stronger powers.However, some owners claim these schemes are a money-making exercise simply designed to boost council coffers. A quick number crunch suggests Brighton’s would bring in between £12m and £16m, while Nottingham will raise between £14m and £23m. Some argue that the worst criminal landlords will simply carry on staying under the radar.Late last month the government announced a review to look at how selective licensing is being used and whether it is working well.What exactly are these schemes?Selective licensing allows councils to make it compulsory for every private rented property in a specified area to have a licence. (There are two other types of landlord licensing, mandatory and additional, that only apply to people letting out so-called houses in multiple occupation, or HMOs).In these areas, a landlord must apply for a licence if they want to rent out a property. This means the council can check whether they are a “fit and proper person”, as well as laying down other requirements concerning the management of the property and health and safety.The schemes work in different ways, but things a landlord might be required to provide include a valid gas safety certificate, an electrical installation condition report, a copy of the tenancy agreement and evidence of landlord insurance. Typically, a licence lasts five years.How many councils are doing this?Lots. At least 55 either have a scheme in place or would like to set one up, according to the Residential Landlords Association (RLA).A number of London local authorities run them, including Brent, which earlier this year won approval to extend its scheme into five more wards. Meanwhile, the new Bexley scheme covers four areas – Thamesmead North, Abbey Wood, Lower Belvedere and parts of Erith. It started accepting licence applications earlier this month ahead of the 1 October start date.However, it’s not just in the capital. Gateshead has several schemes, Blackpool council runs one, and Brighton has applied for approval for a scheme that would cover 12 wards, including Preston Park, St Peter’s and North Laine, and Hanover and Elm Grove. Nottingham’s will cover “most” of the city – more than 30,000 homes – and comes into force on 1 August.It varies. In Nottingham they are £780, or £480 if you are a locally accredited landlord, and a separate licence is needed for each property, even if it’s one person who owns several homes.Gateshead’s standard fee ranges from £550 to £1,000, depending on how early or late you apply, while Bexley’s is £690, with an “early bird discount fee” of £371. The London borough of Waltham Forest’s is £650, while Brighton is proposing a standard £460, or £600 where the council has to do a lot of legwork.What about good landlords who already manage their properties well? Many of the councils say they accept that lots of property owners or managers already deliver good-quality and well-managed homes, but that they can’t exempt them from the schemes. However, in many cases councils offer a discount to landlords who have accreditation.Yes, some are. David Smith, policy director for the RLA, says the schemes rely on landlords pro-actively making themselves known to their local authority. “Criminal landlords who fail to provide secure and safe accommodation to their tenants will not come forward,” he says. “Councils need a much smarter system to find and root out those who will never willingly make themselves known.”Bexley council says it received strong support from owner-occupiers, tenants and businesses. It adds that its fees “are among the lowest in London”, with discounts to support good landlords who come forward. It says it has been working to identify what it can do to support responsible private renting.What’s the view of other councils? Newham in London – the first council to license all private properties – probably spoke for many last week when it said it wanted tougher civil penalties to discourage rogue landlords letting dangerous and overcrowded properties, and the power to confiscate properties from the worst offenders.

Two crucial pieces of Brexit legislation – the customs and trade bills – make their long-delayed return to the House of Commons on Monday and Tuesday.Tory remainers have laid amendments aimed at keeping Britain in a customs union. But with the debate in cabinet moving in the direction of a somewhat softer Brexit, after the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson, all but the most outspoken are now wary of further destabilising the prime minister. Instead, May’s most pressing challenge is likely to be heading off a backlash from members of the well-drilled European Research Group of Tory backbenchers, chaired by ardent leaver Jacob Rees-Mogg, which has tabled a series of amendments. These are unlikely to pass because they will not get Labour support, but the government could face an embarrassing defeat if more than a handful of hardline Brexiters abstain from backing either bill.Labour voted against the second reading of the bills the last time they came before MPs and a senior party source said,: “We are treating both days very seriously”.The leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, confirmed on Thursday that the two bills would be debated at the start of next week – though some at Westminster believed she was preparing to delay the discussions until after the summer break at the request of the chief whip.Davis and Johnson have so far been absent from the chamber of the House of Commons since they resigned over the Chequers compromise that May hopes will finally allow negotiations with Brussels to make progress.Both are expected to make a reappearance on Monday, with Downing Street watching Johnson’s moves, in particular, very carefully.No 10 felt May survived the spate of resignations with her authority largely intact and took the opportunity to reshuffle her cabinet, promoting remainers Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock. Her aides now hope she can survive until parliament’s long summer recess without too many more crises.A vote of no confidence in May would be triggered if 48 Conservative MPs wrote letters to Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the backbench 1922 committee – though many of her backers believe she could face down such a challenge. Under party rules, she would then be safe from another confidence vote for 12 months.The ERG was infuriated by the white paper. The 98-page document sets out plans for a “common rule book” for goods and food, alongside a looser trading relationship for services. It would also see high-skilled workers and students from the EU allowed to continue to come to the UK to live and work and proposes a complex “facilitated customs arrangement”, which would see the UK collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf for some imports.Rees-Mogg has claimed May’s approach will reduce Britain to “vassalage”, echoing Johnson’s claim that such a deal would reduce the UK to “the status of a colony”.On Friday, Davis’s chief of staff, Stewart Jackson, who has claimed his reappointment to serve the new Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, was blocked by Downing Street, compared May’s Brexit stance to the historic error of joining the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM).Britain crashed out of the ERM on Black Wednesday, in October 1992, after trying and failing to halt a decline in the pound, shattering the Tory party’s reputation for economic management.“Chequers could be another ERM. Voters are smart and have long memories. Such a fate can obviously be avoided,” he tweeted.For the time being, the ERG is not openly advocating a change of Tory leadership – instead using what one Brexiter called “Spanish practices” to try to force the government to change course.Davis’s number two at the Department for Exiting the EU, Steve Baker, a former ERG chair, also walked out in protest at the Chequers plan and has made clear he intends to use every parliamentary tactic available to oppose it.Several other more junior Conservative figures also resigned earlier in the week, including two party vice chairs, Ben Bradley and Maria Caulfield. Bradley, who won the marginal seat of Mansfield in last year’s general election, said: “If we do not deliver Brexit in spirit as well as in name, then we are handing Jeremy Corbyn the keys to No 10.”MPs who accepted May’s invitation to her country retreat on Friday included the Weston-super-Mare MP John Penrose and the veteran MP for Gainsborough, Sir Edward Leigh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7346e082d316d4ea797d0cf2d2e9cb06086c0428/0_24_3404_2042/master/3404.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f235bd19a44ae270ef73bf113062ec67","title":"liam fox mays brexit plan offers a great deal of freedom for us trade","story":"Britain will have a “great deal of freedom” to negotiate a trade deal with the US under Theresa May’s Brexit plan, the international trade secretary has said.Following the prime minister’s meeting with President Donald Trump at Chequers, Liam Fox said “very positive” discussions had been taking place with US officials on a future deal after Britain has left the EU.In a joint press conference with May on Friday, Trump appeared to row back on an earlier newspaper interview in which he said the government’s latest proposals would kill off the prospect of a deal with the US. Fox said that ministers had been able to explain details of their plan – which would see Britain maintain a “common rule book” with the EU covering standards for trade in goods – during their meetings with the president and his officials. He said the plan would enable the UK to offer much greater access to US goods than the EU was prepared to allow. At the same time, he stressed that Britain would not admit US agricultural products that did not meet current standards. “We will have complete freedom in terms of market access of how much of those approved goods come into the United Kingdom, so if we want to reduce the tariff, for example, on American cars we would have the freedom to do so,” he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. “That is essentially what we would be able to offer in any trade agreement. We would be able to offer much freer market access than the European Union would.“The standards would be the same. That therefore removes the need for inspection at the border. But in terms of market access, the United Kingdom would have a great deal of freedom.” Fox said that unlike fellow Brexiters Boris Johnson and David Davis, he had not considered resigning over the compromise plan hammered out by senior ministers and he urged the EU to take up the proposed offer in the interests of all their people. “We are making a realistic and positive offer to the European Union. I hope we will get their support because what we need to have is a people’s Brexit, not a bureaucrat’s Brexit,” he said. “We now need to think about the wellbeing of people across Europe, about their prosperity, their jobs, their security, and not about the abstractions of the bureaucrats of Brussels.“I think most people in Britain will think this is that this is a fair, pragmatic and reasonable approach.” However, the former permanent secretary at the Department for International Trade, Sir Martin Donnelly, warned the UK would have to give more ground if it wanted a deal with Brussels. “If we want to have a lot of scope to do trade deals around the world, it is going to be very difficult to have a close relationship with the European Union. That’s the key trade-off that we have got to deal with,” he told the Today programme. “It is going to come down, I think, to how far the UK is prepared to follow the same rules and take on the same obligations as others in the European Union to retain access to that market. If we don’t want to do that, clearly we have got more scope to do trade deals internationally.”On Friday, Trump said he had been convinced that May’s Brexit white paper did not preclude a US trade deal, contrary to his overnight interview with the Sun.He said that he had apologised to May for the article over breakfast and that she had told him, “don’t worry, it’s only the press” – a revelation of a private conversation that drew a grimace from the prime minister.According to his former adviser, Steve Bannon, Trump “gave her some pointers and pulled her off to the side and said: ‘Hey, if I was doing this, here is how tough you have got to be because these guys are not going to let you go.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8faed7fdd221430ec2e48ed14d8d040bf4f319de/0_4_3536_2122/master/3536.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb7cd14155af060a1bfb9612df91242a","title":"leeds wakefield super league match report","story":"• Leeds 20-20 Wakefield• Champions blow lead to extend winless runLeeds Rhinos must now win both their remaining Super League games to stand any chance of avoiding a battle against relegation in the Qualifiers this summer after yet again surrendering a winning position to drop points, this time against Wakefield.Kevin Sinfield’s 19-year playing career with the Rhinos featured many memorable moments at Headingley but his first outing as a coach here will arguably rank as one of his more frustrating evenings. Leeds’ record eight-match losing run appeared destined to end when the Rhinos led by eight points with nine minutes remaining: but old habits, it seem, die hard.Kyle Wood’s try, followed by two goals from the boot of Ryan Hampshire, ensured there would be no winning return to Headingley for Sinfield – with this the third time in less than a month Leeds have collapsed from a winning position to drop a point.At least they arrested their losing run, which gave Sinfield something to hold on to. “We’re not quite ready to win yet,” he said. “But after that showing, we’re on track and can fix things up.”Wakefield would have arguably been favourites to finish ninth had they lost here - but this dramatic fightback alleviates the pressure on them without doubt. “I’m very happy with the point,” their coach, Chris Chester said. “That’s what we’re all about.”In a game with the stakes so high it was perhaps no surprise neither side produced their best all evening – but the greater moments of promise in the first half came from the hosts. They led 18-12 thanks to tries for Ryan Hall, Ash Handley and Richie Myler: and, given their dominance, they should have been further ahead.As it was, Wakefield made them pay. All Leeds could muster after half-time was a penalty from the boot of Liam Sutcliffe and, while this was undoubtedly an improved effort from Leeds, Wakefield produced a compelling fightback to deny them victory.First, Wood claimed his own kick which Hampshire converted - before the scrum-half added a late penalty of his own in the final moments to secure a point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecd29ecbc25f013dce2b66243e83861d97f797d5/81_202_4537_2722/master/4537.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce6eaadd8775f885964ca5e423e9f176","title":"talking horses saturday racing tips july cup sands of mali","story":"Richard Fahey stunned the betting market by saddling Mayson to win the July Cup at 20-1 six years ago and now the Yorkshire trainer may be about to follow up with a rather more obvious contender in Sands Of Mali (2.15). The zippy three-year-old appeals at 8-1 for the highlight of a typically action-packed Super Saturday with 10 televised races.He may have been a shade unlucky when half a length behind Eqtidaar at Royal Ascot, having raced apart from that rival, and the ability he showed in two previous wins suggests he may be able to turn that around and beat the older horses he meets for the first time.12.45 Ascot At the age of eight, Line Of Reason is perhaps entitled to take a bit longer to reach his peak fitness but he has finally got there now for this season, judging by his recent success at Ayr.1.05 Newmarket Aidan O’Brien has an exciting prospect in Cape Of Good Hope, a full brother to both Highland Reel and Idaho. Time and distance will be the making of him but the way he made all to score on his third racecourse outing suggests his rivals here may have some trouble keeping tabs on him.1.20 Ascot Three of these finished close up in the Queen Anne Stakes at the Royal meeting but, while that was run over the straight mile, this round-course race presents a different test. Century Dream might be the one who copes best, having had the pace to score at Epsom on his previous start.1.40 Newmarket Having put together some useful form in big-field, straight-course handicaps, Mjjack might be overpriced at 16-1 here. He beat a next-time winner when scoring over this distance on the Rowley Mile in April, a run flanked by two lesser efforts on softer ground.1.55 York Muthmir looks a safer option, for all that he’s giving a few pounds away to all these. He came up short by only a neck in a Group Three last weekend, the winner having had the run of the race.2.35 York The only course winner in the field and the highest rated on official figures, Dal Harraild is taken to score on this return to the track after a three-month absence.3.10 York It’s understandable that the Royal Hunt Cup was the early-season target for Bless Him, who won the Britannia at Royal Ascot last year.

Then a couple of balls with a bit too much dip, going down leg and the only two runs from the over are wides. 3rd over: India 16-0 (Sharma 8, Dhawan 7) - target 323 Wood nearly gets through Dhawan, but the lefty jabs his bat down in time and manages to get the ball away down to fine leg for a couple. A few more singles from the over, including a pull that Sharma nailed but it went along the ground, straight to fine leg. 2nd over: India 11-0 (Sharma 6, Dhawan 4) - target 323 Big Dave Willey will bowl from the Nursery End. He gets a bit of lift to Sharma, who collects four with an inside-edge that flies fine just past the keeper. He then floats one up pleasantly for Dhawan, who duly lashes it through the covers for four. 1st over: India 2-0 (Sharma 1, Dhawan 0) - target 323 England have a couple of slips in straight away, knowing they’ll need early wickets. After a couple that don’t carry particularly well, the second of those slips comes to short extra-cover. Wood beats Sharma’s edge then spoils things a little with a wide down leg, before Sharma gets his first run with a cuffed pull that I think came off his thumb. The players are out on the holy turf. Shikhar Dhawan and the almighty Rohit Sharma will open the batting, and Mark Wood has the ball from the Pavilion End. Afternoon all, Nick Miller here. So have England got enough? Even with that last stand between Root and Willey, 322 feels a bit light. Particularly as the Indian batsmen seem to really have the measure of England’s bowlers, if the game at Trent Bridge is anything to go by. They’ve got a bit more to bowl at this time, but they would still have liked another 30-40 runs. Email me here, or tweet @NickMiller79 with your thoughts50th over: England 322-7 (Root 113, Willey out for 50) Willey, won’t he have time for a fifty? He will. Some hard running brings David Willey, son of Peter, his first half-century in his 41st one-day international, off only 31 balls. My guess is that he may well turn out to be a better batter than bowler. Willey is run out off the last ball, but what matters is that he and Root piled up 83 off only 52 balls, and England got close to the 330 that they had been eyeing before the mid-innings slump. What also matters, very much with a five-Test series coming up, is that Root is right back in form. No wonder the cameras find Ed Smith laughing his head off. But the last laugh may yet belong to Virat Kohli, who will feel his classy strokemakers can chase this total down. Thanks for your company, and do stay with us as Nick Miller steers you through the second half of the day. 49th over: England 314-6 (Root 110, Willey 45) Umesh manages not to get clattered, but he does bowl a no-ball, and then a run-out chance goes begging. India in a bit of disarray. “The man in the red headband,” says John Starbuck (44th over), “is probably Willie Nelson.” True.48th over: England 305-6 (Root 106, Willey 42) Before Root reached his hundred, Willey played a couple more of his bludgeoning blows. Afterwards, Root joined in with his first six of the day, swinging Pandya away to deep midwicket. The stand, already worth 66 off 38 balls, is being rightly acclaimed by the crowd. And a cri de coeur lands in my inbox. “Why oh why,” wonders Nigel Phillips, “is this not on terrestrial TV? In the pub the tennis is on, football later. A little kid just asked me what cricket was. It is impossible to explain without it on TV. The BBC should chat to Sky and say, ‘we give up on football, but please let us show a bit of live cricket’. If they can pay Claudia Winkleman over £300k for larking around, they can afford to pay for some cricket. Until they do, I refuse to pay my licence fee.” He’s barely seen the strike in the last three overs, but now Root moves over onto off stump and whips Pandya for two to reach a very fine century. It’s his 12th in ODIs, but his first against India, his first at Lord’s, and, most significantly, his first since being dropped from the T20 team. He’s not the captain in this format, but that is a captain’s innings. 47th over: England 292-6 (Root 99, Willey 36) Umesh has decided to play baseball, and Willey is up for it – he smashes one full toss for four to long-off, then clubs another for four to deep midwicket, where it is fielded in the old Indian style. That’s the fifty partnership: 52 off only 31 balls, and just 17 of the runs scored by Root. A stern email from James Walsh. “If Ben Walker from the EBC is still reading, be great if he knows when they plan to put Test cricket back on free to air. It’s been 13 summers since it got hidden behind Murdoch’s paywall and barely anyone knows what Joe Root looks like, never mind whether he belongs in your greatest XI.”46th over: England 281-6 (Root 98, Willey 26) Fortified by his auto-nutmeg, Willey tucks into Kaul. A straight drive for four, a pull for six, a flat-bat pull for four more, a tonk for two off the toe end, and a squirted single to nick the strike, not that Root will mind. In this mood, Willey is a superb mixture of the skilled and the agricultural.45th over: England 264-6 (Root 98, Willey 9) Kuldeep’s final over, and England are almost treating him like a normal bowler, milking him for singles. Willey tries a slog-sweep, nutmegs himself and picks up three.A few minutes ago Sky zoomed in on Mike Gatting just as he sat down to his lunch, complete with a linen napkin tucked into his collar. (“The first of 15 courses,” chortled Nasser.) This did not go unnoticed by Brian Withington. “The cut away to Mike Gatting tucking into his lunch with such gusto brings to mind the immortal Duckworth Lewis Method line from Jiggery Pokery. Having succumbed to Warne’s ball of the century, our hero plaintively exclaims, ‘If it had been a cheese roll it would never have got past me!’ Talk about art imitating life.” Or the other way round, in this case?44th over: England 256-6 (Root 95, Willey 4) Kaul is back, still auditioning for a movie called The Man in The Red Headband. He concedes four singles, which won’t bother Kohli at all.43rd over: England 252-6 (Root 93, Willey 2) England badly need a boost and Root provides it with a lovely late cut off Kuldeep, using the pace of a quicker ball to run it down to the Allen Stand. And then he goes well forward to cover-drive for four more. He really is back in form – he just needs some fireworks at the other end, and Willey should be the man to provide them.In other news, Rafa Nadal has won the fourth set, so that semi-final is going all the way. In the unlikely event that you reckon it sounds more gripping than this game, join Will Unwin here.42nd over: England 240-6 (Root 83, Willey 0) That is a well-earned wicket for Chahal, who’s been testing throughout. He finishes with one for 43 off his ten overs.On Twitter, Lawrence Booth points out that England made only 43 for 3 between overs 30 and 40. It’s now 20 years since Booth turned up as an intern at Wisden Cricket Monthly. I was wondering what had become of him.Moeen’s slog-sweep is his undoing in the end, as Chahal teases him with flight and Sharma takes the catch at deep midwicket. England are throwing this away.41st over: England 236-5 (Root 80, Ali 12) Kuldeep returns, and nearly gets Moeen, who goes for the big Mo, connects with thin air, and is lucky to find the ball hitting only a fourth stump. Next ball, he tries it again and gets four – great shot. But England need a massive over.40th over: England 228-5 (Root 78, Ali 6) Realising that he needs to do something, Root goes for the big heave against Chahal, misses it, and survives a review for a stumping. He’s playing something like second fiddle when England really need a big, bad, screechy guitar solo. That appeal from the ECB (36th over) brings a tart retort from StJohn Bird. “I’d love to think the ECB could celebrate the 1000th England Men’s Test match by trying to give us the impression that they even slightly care about Test matches or the Test team anymore. I mean, we’d know it was all a bit fake but it would help keep up the pretence for a while longer at least. Or, you know, they could actually start to properly care and celebrate Test cricket. Like s of the game ought to.”39th over: England 224-5 (Root 75, Ali 5) Another quiet over, from Umesh. I hope Root hasn’t forgotten how to be a finisher. His team, and the game, need him to get 120 here.38th over: England 220-5 (Root 73, Ali 2) Pandya’s over goes for four as Moeen plays himself in. The last five overs have yielded only 20, for two. At this rate, England’s seamers will have to grab some early wickets to make a game of it.37th over: England 216-5 (Root 71, Ali 1) Well done Umesh, and Kohli – he has pegged England back. Andrew Benton picks up on Sankaran Krishna’s point (34th over). “A block of Roquefort on a warm day would be pretty penetrating. Seriously cheesy.”The pendulum swings. England’s gun backfires as Buttler cuts at a ball that was a bit close to him, perhaps not helped by his own trigger movement forwards. India on top now, and Root has a job to do.36th over: England 212-4 (Root 70, Buttler 2) Root breaks the shackles by square-driving Pandya for four – one of those moments when he looks like the player Mike Atherton might have been if he hadn’t had a bad back. This is now Root’s highest score for England this summer, beating his 68 in the second innings of the first Test against Pakistan, also at Lord’s.And here’s Ben Walker from the ECB. Is he about to tell me off? No. “I don’t know if you are aware but the first Specsavers Test against India at Edgabston is the 1000th England Men’s Test. To celebrate we are asking fans to vote for their greatest ever England Men’s Test XI. Here’s the link and I wondered if it would be possible to mention it on the OBO?” https:r1.surveysandforms1b2sx2a0-c437ii4735th over: England 204-4 (Root 64, Buttler 0) Kohli withdraws Kuldeep and brings back the other Yadav, Umesh, so it’s pace at both ends, presumably because Buttler can read Kuldeep. It pays off as Umesh smothers Root with the help of two fine stops, one at short extra, the other at midwicket.Ian Andrew joins the conversation about fast-bowling captains. “One FS Trueman did rather well in the only game he captained against Australia.”34th over: England 203-4 (Root 63, Buttler 0) A handy over from Pandya, who now has one for 45 off seven. And he has half-answered this point from Sankaran Krishna. “Euphoric as it is to watch Kuldeep grab so many wickets and constantly flummox the batsmen, as an India fan I have to wonder who in heck is going to take wickets other than him? All the rest seem to be about as penetrating as a block of cheese on a warm day.” Nice line.Kohli takes the slip out and Stokes takes the bait, trying a glide to third man that just gives Dhoni an easy catch. Stokes is the first England batsman today not to get going, and Pandya is the first bowler not called Kuldeep to get a wicket.33rd over: England 200-3 (Root 61, Stokes 4) Kuldeep continues, and Root brings out the reverse sweep. He only connects with the edge, and Dhoni almost grabs it, Sarah Taylor style, but it goes for four and the fact that he felt like playing it speaks volumes about his confidence.Meanwhile, the captaincy debate rumbles on. “Forget about Willis, Botham or Flintoff,” says Rob Razzell, “what about Akram, Kapil Dev or Shaun Pollock as great fast bowling captains? There’s no reason it can’t work. I’ve always thought Broad has a good tactical mind, but it’s all a bit late now.” Not necessarily. And Pollock a bit flattered there, I’d say – nice guy but not a natural leader. How about Imran Khan, and, as a slow-bowling captain, Ray Illingworth?32nd over: England 192-3 (Root 55, Stokes 2) Another good over for India as Pandya strings some dots together. Why the struggling Stokes has come in ahead of the barnstorming Buttler is anyone’s guess.31st over: England 189-3 (Root 54, Stokes 0) After taking the wicket, Kuldeep ties Root down, and he now has three for 32. What a force he is. Morgan had just got away with a miscued slog to deepish midwicket, so he’ll be kicking himself twice over. But it was an excellent partnership between the two captains, which added 103 off 98 balls and staved off the eternal spectre of an England collapse. Kuldeep does it again! Typical in one way, but not in another. He bowls a rare full toss and Morgan bunts it straight to the man at deep midwicket. A badly judged end to a well-judged innings.30th over: England 185-2 (Root 54, Morgan 49) Another four-run over from Chahal. The man is a machine.And here’s Toby Sims. “I’ve always thought that (not exclusively) captains have made great pundits (Athers, Nasser, Ricky Ponting to name but a few) - and I’ve found Stuart Broad to be extremely insightful… probably not a coincidence that people have always wondered why he never captained. Having said that, I’ve found Tuffers quite insightful when he’s not being the butt of the jokes, so what do I know…!”29th over: England 181-2 (Root 53, Morgan 46) Kuldeep returns, strangely unaccompanied by the music from Jaws. Root, seeing it large now, works him to leg for a couple to reach a fine fifty. He needed that.“Following John Starbuck’s explanation of Broad’s lack of captaincy,” says Brian Withington, “I can only smile thinking about the DRS review protocol if Stuart were bowling AND captain. Some sort of gagging regime might be in order.” Good point.27th over: England 176-2 (Root 49, Morgan 45) Emboldened by that big over, Morgan dances down the track to Chahal’s first ball and on-drives it for six. That’s 46 off the last six overs, much better from England.26th over: England 168-2 (Root 48, Morgan 38) Kohli gives Raina another over and instantly regrets it as Morgan plays a controlled lofted sweep for four and Root late-cuts for four more, deliciously. That’s a sign that Root is back in form.25th over: England 156-2 (Root 42, Morgan 32) Chahal is keeping it tight, not threatening but going for just four an over. Morgan sweeps him for two, but there are only two singles off the last five balls. That’s the halfway stage, with England eyeing 330, and India, with six overs of Kuldeep up their sleeve, eyeing a middle-order collapse. 24th over: England 152-2 (Root 41, Morgan 29) Kohli tries a bit of Suresh Raina. “Off-spin!” say the two Brits, “we can milk that!” Six singles from the over. This game is now nicely poised.

What I hadn’t reckoned on was the organised gangs that are out to target tourists, particularly, it has to be said, in Spain. And how, with just a few simple steps, I could have protected myself (and my money).This is what you’re supposed to do before you go abroad:Take your wallet and empty it out. Remove all the things you really don’t need for a week or two in Spain, that if they were lost or stolen would just be a pain. Your work staff pass. Your Tesco Clubcard or Boots Advantage or Waitrose card. Your library or cinema membership card. Your driving licence (if you’re not hiring a car). Credit cards you know you are not going to use. All those other little loyalty cards, receipts and general rubbish you keep in your wallet. Why take them abroad? Just leave them in the sock drawer until you’re back home.The next stage is to split things up. Why have everything in one wallet? By all means take two credit cards, one as a back-up. Secrete credit cards in pockets or toiletry bags. The same with your physical cash – leave some of your eurossterling in your wallet to use while travelling, and hide the rest elsewhere among your bags and belongings.It’s what I always used to do. But of course, for some reason I didn’t this time. Maybe it was the exceptionally early flight from Stansted (never again). Maybe it was the lackadaisical way I now treat flying. So there I was, with my partner, standing on a dark and humid platform at Barcelona’s El Prat de Llobregat station, waiting for a connection to Sitges. Absolutely everything in one wallet, bulging out of my front pocket. Stuffed in the other pocket my phone and my passport. One hand dragging a wheelie bag, the other a small holdall.I hope I am painting a cliched picture of a victim, for that is what I was. There were a bewildering few seconds before we even realised we were being mugged. As the train pulled in and we walked up to the sliding doors, there was a commotion as some people pushed and shoved to get off. Others, behind us, were aggressively pushing on. But it was entirely fake – devised by a gang to separate us, then rob us.I looked down, to see my wallet in the hand of one of the men. Weirdly, as I wrestled it back, there was a pained expression on the thief’s face, as if I were falsely accusing him. Meanwhile, my partner’s bag was being slashed. Fortunately, we are both big enough (or stupid enough?) to fight back, and after a short tussle they scarpered.These incidents must be rife in Barcelona, judging by the only mildly sympathetic shrugs we got from fellow passengers on the train. The Renfe security staff at our destination were similarly uninterested. At our hotel, the Spanish receptionist said an English tourist had arrived the week before, and was robbed of everything at the same station. Never use El Prat de Llobregat, she told us.Fortunately, we lost little: two €20 notes nicked from the top of my pocket that weren’t in the wallet that I had been able to grab back. My phone and passport were also safe. But it was a deeply upsetting way to start a holiday.I don’t blame myself – I’ll save that for the nasty, vicious toerags who attacked us. But to anyone heading off this summer, take precautionary steps first. I wish I had practised what I preach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69532de34cbbc5d148dbddeac966c5ac97723ef2/166_500_5834_3500/master/5834.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2156cf2432a3ba547dff2863fef769cb","title":"wingly flight sharing channel","story":"Flight-sharing sites offer a cheap way of crossing the Channel or seeing the Dales from the airWe’ve had cars and bikes, and now the sharing economy is going airborne with services that allow the public to take to the skies in an affordable way.Flight-sharing websites such as Wingly claim to be bringing private aviation to the masses and giving ordinary people the chance to pop over to France for lunch in a private plane, or nip across to the Isle of Wight for tea, without having to take out a second mortgage.Flights from the south coast to the Isle of Wight start at about £26 each way per person, with day trips from just outside London to the French resorts of Deauville and Le Touquet from £66 each way (see box at right).Wingly connects private pilots with members of the public so they can share the cost of a flight, and has been variously dubbed “the Uber of the skies” and “the Airbnb of aviation”. Most of the pilots fly small single-engine piston planes with between two and six seats.The website specialises in sightseeing trips and excursions, as well as offering a speedy way of getting from A to B. In addition to northern France, the Isle of Wight and the Channel Islands, popular destinations include York, Oxford and Cambridge.But if you are the sort of person who travels a lot for business and was thinking this could be a good alternative to taking a train or flying with the likes of Ryanair, then think again – this is all about leisure travel.Based in France, Wingly now has 3,000 UK pilots on its books – across Europe the figure is 10,000 – but it is not a commercial airline or a charter service, and it is also not an “on-demand” service in the style of Uber. The vast majority of the pilots have day jobs, so it is likely it will take a few days to arrange things. And be aware that flights may be cancelled for any reason including weather conditions or because the pilot’s plans have changed. There are no scheduled routes – you are simply sharing a ride.Wingly isn’t the only flight-sharing service operating in the UK – others include fellow French-based company Coavmi. Both were name-checked in a May 2018 blog by the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which some might view as an endorsement of sorts. Another company that was ploughing this furrow, called Skyüber, apparently couldn’t make a go of it and threw in the towel last year, and  Money couldn’t find out much about one that we found online called Share My Flight.Wingly is almost certainly the biggest player. It operates in the UK, France and Germany, takes a commission on all flights, and says that more than 150,000 people have signed up to use the service. However, according to a report on aviation news website Flyer this week, “several airfields have banned Wingly operations”, so it has clearly not all been smooth sailing.The big selling point for private pilots is that flight-sharing can help them cut the cost of their pricey hobby. Until recently, pilots could only share these costs with friends or fellow flying club members. However, the CAA says that “thanks to the introduction of a regulation by the EU”, these costs can now be shared by up to six people including the pilot, while restrictions on advertising have also been removed, allowing online platforms to match up pilots and passengers.Roughly speaking, it costs about £150 an hour to fly a private plane, and the average cost of using Wingly is £50 per person per hour, says a spokesman. As the majority of the Wingly flights carry two passengers, using the platform allows a pilot to cut their expenses by about two-thirds.Would-be passengers can search on the site for flights departing from their area, or by destination, price and so on. While some of the flights listed are on specific dates, most are flexible – users typically message the pilot to discuss dates and requirements.The price depends on a number of things, including how many people are sharing the flight and the length of the journey. And there are likely to be limits on the amount of luggage.The service seems to be particularly popular with people looking for a novel way to celebrate a special occasion such as a birthday or wedding anniversary.Flying to Bembridge on the Isle of Wight is one of the most popular trips offered by Wingly pilot Steve Batchelor, 57, who signed up with the platform in December 2017 and owns a four-seat Piper Warrior which he keeps at Solent airport in Hampshire. Batchelor, who lives near Chichester, has been a pilot for eight years. Since joining the platform he has done about 20 trips, the furthest of which was to Alderney in the Channel Islands.Asked how much passengers typically pay, he says: “Most of the trips seem to be around £50 to £100 return ... It’s worked out well for me – I’m flying more than I ever did before. It’s great to meet new people.”Flight-sharing is perfectly legal, though pilots are not allowed to make a profit, and the CAA says the “direct costs” must be shared between all the plane’s occupants, including the pilot, up to a maximum of six people. Direct costs means those directly incurred in relation to a flight such as fuel and airfield charges.Wingly handles the payments and collects the money from passengers via cards or PayPal. What about customs and immigration if you are flying to, say, France? Talk to your pilot before you go about anything you may need to do. You will need to take your passport. The rules will vary depending on the airfield – with some, the pilot will need to submit details in advance, and there will usually be someone there who is responsible for checking UK visitors. • The London city skyline from the air for £50 per person, flying from Damyns Hall aerodrome in Upminster, Essex• A day trip from Redhill aerodrome in Surrey to Le Havre in Normandy for £53 each way• Day trips from Blackbushe airport in Surrey to Deauville in Normandy or Le Touquet, a little further up the French coast, for £66 each way• Lunch or tea in Bembridge, on the easternmost point of the Isle of Wight, for £26 each way, flying from Solent airport in Lee-on-the-Solent, Hampshire• A York and the Yorkshire Dales sightseeing flight for £50 per person, flying from Bagby airfield, near Thirsk, North Yorkshire• A day trip from Cornwall to the Isles of Scilly for £32 each way, flying from Cornwall airport, NewquayPrices may be dependent on how many passengers are booking"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5085c6ae49d68a79c29cc2d345a5466324c399fd/0_110_4621_2771/master/4621.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ac2caafe4bfa2b30e43912162416162","title":"our shirley valentine summer review","story":"The latest reality TV show takes the likes of Nancy Dell’Olio and Melinda Messenger to the Greek island of Naxos to help them rediscover their sexuality“Oh God, here we go, up the fanny,” mutters comic Ninia Benjamin, obediently clenching her nether regions. One of eight celebrities in the throes of middle age in Our Shirley Valentine Summer (Thursday, 9.30pm, ITV), Benjamin is attending a meditation session on the Greek island of Naxos aimed at helping women rediscover their sexuality. Having been single for most of her life, Ninia is dealing with some serious confidence issues – “My biggest hope for my time here is that I go: ‘Ninia Benjamin’s all right,’” she says. It remains to be seen whether imagining her life force as a snake slithering out of her flange will make this happen.Inspired by the Pauline Collins film about self-discovery, this mid-life, mid-budget Love Island sees its participants taking stock and looking for romance, although imagining a future is easier said than done for the ladies of Naxos, who are either terminally single or newly orced.

Despite photographs showing large stretches of the National Mall empty that had been crowded with people for Barack Obama’s inauguration, Spicer insisted that Trump’s inauguration had drawn the largest audience in history. In his book, Spicer explains that he took the lectern under direct pressure from the president to shoot down the unwelcome news reports – and that Trump was unhappy with his performance.“I went back to my office, expecting an ‘attaboy’ from the president,” Spicer writes. “Instead Reince was waiting for me and said the president wasn’t happy at all with how I had performed. He didn’t like my not taking questions. He thought I was hung up on the wrong issues. He wanted to know why I hadn’t run my statement by him.”Spicer reflects on the moment as a potentially fatal stumble. “Minutes later, the president himself called, and he was not pleased,” he writes. “And I started to wonder if my first day would be my last.”After Spicer’s performance in the Brady briefing room, actor Melissa McCarthy lampooned him in a Saturday Night Live skit, chomping gum, screaming at reporters and ultimately ripping the lectern out of the floor and charging with it at the media. The impression made Spicer a national laughingstock – but in his book, Spicer reveals that he was laughing along too.“Taking a deep breath, I went to the DVR and saw Melissa McCarthy wearing my suit, downing gum by the bucket (guilty as charged, but never at the lectern), and yelling at the media,” Spicer writes. “I had no choice but to laugh.”While Spicer, who also worked for Trump during the presidential campaign, does not spend a lot of time in his book on Hillary Clinton, he does offer his analysis of where the Clinton campaign went wrong. His book includes a play-by-play analysis of the three debates between Trump and Clinton. Spicer accuses Clinton, whose campaign produced an unprecedented amount of material on the candidates’ policy views, of avoiding “the issues” in debate number one.Leaving a commemoration of the September 11 attacks at Ground Zero in New York in 2016, Clinton stumbled and had to be helped into a waiting van. She was taken to her daughter’s Manhattan apartment, where she later addressed the media on the sidewalk. Her campaign later revealed that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia and she canceled a trip to California.In his book, Spicer writes that the Clinton campaign made a fatal mistake that day. “Had Hillary Clinton gone to the hospital right away, it would have been better for her,” Spicer writes. “At every turn, Hillary and her overly protective staff acted as if they had something to hide. Every email and Clinton Foundation scandal, every too-clever-by-half statement by the Clintons and their team, came together to define her in that moment as the soul of duplicity.”In May 2017, a Trump entourage including the president, the first lady, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner and staffers down to the digital director, Dan Scavino, had an audience with the pope at the Vatican. But Spicer, a devout Catholic, was not invited. In his book, Spicer describes the moment, and how he asked Scavino to carry rosaries to the meeting for the pope to bless. The book includes a picture of the pope blessing the beads. At places in his book, Spicer simply admits to having made mistakes. At one news conference he attacked the Syrian regime by invoking Hitler, saying: “You had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn’t even sink to using chemical weapons.” Asked by a reporter to clarify his remarks, Spicer struggled to articulate that the Nazis used poisonous gas to execute Jews at concentration camps, which he ended up referring to as “Holocaust centers”.In his book, Spicer describes the sinking feeling he had as he felt himself in a hole and unable to stop digging. “What had I done. Holocaust centers?” he wonders.The feeling deepens and deepens: “I read the body language of not only the reporters but also my own staffers along the side of the room. I was beginning to realize I had misspoken badly.”In his book, Spicer has only nice things to say about figures such as the disgraced former congressman Mark Foley, for whom he once worked, and the disgraced former cabinet secretary Tom Price. But one figure does capture Spicer’s ire: Anthony Scaramucci, the brash New Yorker whose hiring as communications director prompted Spicer’s resignation. In his book, Spicer insists he did not feel vindicated when transcripts and audio of a phone call emerged in which Scaramucci told reporter Ryan Lizza that he was going “to fire every one” of his subordinates and declared: “I’m not Steve Bannon, I’m not trying to suck my own cock.” Scaramucci lost his job soon afterwards.“While alternating currents of outrage and amusement flowed through the White House in the aftermath of Scaramucci’s conversation with Lizza, I took great pains not to show any emotion and just keep doing my job,” Spicer writes. “Some people asked me privately if I felt vindicated. I didn’t need vindication.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddeb04e2f2fcf4666287365ff9909b40bd8b31c1/64_217_3412_2047/master/3412.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b50fb0a82c5ef67d6a4dae696be23bb","title":"wakaliwood inside ugandas action movie studio","story":"When the trailer for Who Killed Captain Alex? went viral on YouTube, film-maker Isaac Nabwana’s mobile phone starting ringing with calls from around the world. One inidual went further. After seeing 40 seconds of the promo for Uganda’s first action movie, American Alan Hofmanis gave up his life in Manhattan to move to Wakaliga, Kampala, to help Nabwana, aka IGG, develop Ramon film studio – and Wakaliwood was born.The Ramon Film Studio, has produced more than 40 movies. Who Killed Captain Alex was produced in 2010 for just $200, while 2016’s Operation Kakongoliro! The Ugandan Expendables cost $2,000, the studio’s biggest production budget to date. To attract more viewers and break new ground, Nabwana wanted a female lead for Who Killed Captain Alex?Dozens of people work on Nabwana’s films, taking on all roles both in front and behind the camera: acting, doing stunts, designing props and costumes, technician duties and stage management. From the machinery to accessories and costumes, everything is homemade. Many of the actors live in the rehearsal rooms where costumes are kept.With little hope of pay for the moment, Wakaliwood members have side jobs. In a country where film piracy is common, Wakaliwood movies are mainly sold door-to-door and as quickly as possible, before pirated copies make it on to the market.That a film studio is able to flourish in a place where cinema has little history may surprise some. Yet, Wakaliwood has emerged despite what from the outside may appear to insurmountable obstacles.Wakaliwood is also lending credence to a Ugandan pop culture that some observers have linked to Quentin Tarantino for convenience. But it can only be understood by going beyond the violence that flows through the stories, the litres of food colouring that stains the fallen, and the archaic and mischievous special effects.For the bloody special effects, condoms are filled with food colouring and tied with a plastic ribbon around the chest of a stuntman. A metal ring is glued to the condom and fishing wire is attached to it, to be pulled by an assistant at the appropriate time. Cow blood was used in the past but some of crew members became ill after accidentally swallowed it.In a Wakaliwood movie, there are always tens of gangsters, hoodlums or bad guys whose main job is to be killed by the good guys. To attain the high body count, the bad guys wear balaclavas, or caps, or beards. This allows crew members to play numerous baddies destined for a bloody end.The film-maker’s half-brother Robert Kizito discovered kung fu 30 years ago through Bruce Lee’s films. Mimicking them to his brother, Kizito was bitten by the martial arts bug while inspiring Nabwana towards a love for the films. He scoured central market of Kampala for Chinese martial arts magazines to dissect the positions from the diagrams inside their pages. A kung fu master, Kizito and his followers where filmed by his brother for Wakaliwood’s first ever action scenes.Nabwana was child during the bloody rule of Idi Amin. The film-maker recalls the swollen corpses in a dumping ground near his home and the soldiers drumming at the doors of the houses, shouting: “Fungua mlango, panda gari” (“Open the door, get in the truck” in Swahili) Mixing memory and his love Bruce Lee films, Nabwana has emerged as unique film-maker.Eaten Alive is a movie inspired by a cannibalism case that happened a few years ago in western Uganda.Wakaliwood has captured the imagination of a nation, from the drivers of boda boda, (motorbike or bicycle taxi) to President Yoweri Museveni who did not hesitate to incorporate support for the industry as a campaign promise, during the 2016 presidential election.A VJ adds extra colour to a movie with their jokes, gamut of expressions,tone, rhythm, the turn of phrase and extra dialogue. Emmie is part of the Wakaliwood family. He comments on every movie and his commentary is part of the movie. Nabwana said he cannot shoot a movie without considering Emmie’s commentary. Audiences pay 500 Ugandan shillings (20p) a ticket for a US blockbuster and 1,000 shillings (42p) for a Wakaliga movie.I have been going to Wakaliwood for years, but I have not managed to unravel the mystery of Nabwana’s trajectory. It is the defiance of the impossible, like the life-size Bell Huey helicopter by the props crew in the yard of his family compound. Visitors describe him as a pop-culture prophet preaching from his slum the good word of cinema, communicating a certain idea of his country rather than basking the sun of international film festivals.All photography by Frédéric Noy."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3561253.1531308946!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"clifftops have given me some of the high point of my life","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“The view from the top balcony can be sublime.” Illustration: Michael VineyA good many of the high points in my life have perched me, appropriately, on clifftops. Prostrate among island sea pinks above seals and wheeling seabirds, or crouched among Arctic rocks to watch polar bears parading on the frozen fiord below, the view from the top balcony can be sublime.With or without wildlife, the view is what enchants summer tourists on the Wild Atlantic Way. On TripAdvisor, some hundreds of visitors to Donegal’s Slieve League have been ecstatic. “Dramatic scenery, history, elemental nature, and the freshest air in all the world. Powerful!” sets the tone.We oldies, of course, remember Slieve League before the fenced viewing platform, the shuttle bus up from the visitor centre, the car parks and craft shop, the ice cream van and “yummy” lobster rolls at the top. Clutching each other, well back from the edge, 600m above the sea, we muttered “Oh my God!” into the wind long before that cry went acronymic and digital.Together with the seashore between the tides, the cliffs of Ireland are the island’s last wild – or “least modified” – land. Hard and metamorphic at its storm-lashed western rim, soft and crumbly in glacial boulder clay, they make up a fifth of the coastline.All of them qualify for periodic monitoring as “EU Annex 1 habitat Vegetated sea cliffs of the Atlantic and Baltic coasts” under Europe’s nature directives. Peering up through binoculars from boats or tidal shores, lowered (exceptionally) on ropes, or peering at good helicopter and telephoto images, a team of botanists has done its best to identify and map what’s growing at almost 200 locations, 32 of them surveyed in person (see Irish Wildlife Manual No 53 at npws.ie)Most are at least partly within NPWS conservation sites, offering some clout against rubbish tips and car dumps (a special temptation on islands) or misplaced rock armour at the base. A more natural “threat” is invasion by alien plants, such as gunnera, cotoneaster, escaped garden hebe and silvery ragwort, all documented in the NPWS survey. Native vegetation begins with the black skirt of lichen at the splash zone of Atlantic cliffs and a progression of salt-resistant plants to the windy fringe above.At every crevice and ledge, flowering cushions of sea pink are the most frequent plants, but surveys with ropes found more than twice as many species as could be spotted in remote photographs, filling in the plantains, wild thyme, mosses and lichens.The tallest cliff in the survey was at Achill’s Slievemore (660m to 670m), and the longest stretch centred at Glinsk on the north Mayo coast. This offers a remarkable 68km of swoops and crags, historical haunt of golden and sea eagles.The stiff-winged fulmar was noted as the commonest breeding seabird. Since it first arrived in Mayo in 1911, the fulmar’s coast-wide spread and assiduous trawler-stalking have helped keep its population relatively secure, though the falling numbers of young fulmars echo a wider seabird decline.Among the thousands of birds lining the ledges of island and mainland cliffs, the most exposed positions are taken by the guillemot. Dispensing with a nest, it relies on the conical (pyriform) shape to its egg to stop it rolling off. A coating of sticky guano also helps, but accidents happen and starfish swarm to an eggy, seabed banquet at the foot of some cliffs in Kerry.The clamour of the bird colonies peaks in early summer and begins to quieten down this month as partly-grown chicks flutter down to the sea, paddle feet splayed, and shepherded by a parent. This happens at dusk in failing light to avoid the beaks of great black-backed gulls and skuas.Puffins are mostly gone in a rapid desertion in August. The single chick has been fed by both parents, flying back to the burrow among clifftop sea pinks with their notched bills lined – ideally – with sandeels.Human impacts (global warming sending the sandeels north, the global ocean litter of plastic pellets) have led to damaging changes in puffin diet, to impossibly spiny fish species or gulletfuls of plastic lentils. But new research suggests another, biological, factor.An international study, led by Oxford University and involving UCC scientists, tracked the journeys of 270 puffins from a wide range of breeding grounds around the Atlantic to feed in winter on shoals of oil-rich capelin off North America. Irish birds, taking a circuitous route, made the longest journeys – up to 4,700km there and back. They arrive to breed at our cliffs so exhausted that they lay only one egg and struggle to feed the chick. So suggests the study published in Current Biology and reported fully at https:iti.ms2J6yN9z. All the more reason, says study co-author Mark Jessopp of UCC, to care for the puffins we’ve got.

The restrictions will initially be in place for a week.Most of the affected suburbs are on the southside of the city, with just nine northside suburbs due to be hit with restrictions. While the restrictions will stretch through south Dublin all the way to Bray in north Wicklow, Beaumont will the most northerly suburb effected.Most households will experience low night-time pressures, but “no loss of supply” Irish Water said. However, supply to some customers on high ground and at remote end of networks “may reduce to trickle at kitchen sink”.In apartments, customers may experience low night-time pressures, depending on their building’s pumping and storage system, the utility said.There has been no significant rain for three weeks and the country is experiencing a drought. Met Éireann’s yellow status drought advisory was in place until midday on Friday.Met Éireann said it will be generally misty and cloudy over the weekend, with some hazy sunshine and scattered showers. Highest temperatures will be between 23 and 25 degrees with cooler conditions in Atlantic coastal areas.Kate Gannon, corporate affairs manager with Irish Water, said the restrictions will result in lower water pressure in some areas of Dublin, Wicklow, Meath and Kildare between midnight and 5am.Ms Gannon said there were already restrictions in 25 areas around the country. She said even if there was two weeks of heavy rainfall it would be soaked up by the parched ground immediately and would not see water sources replenished.“We need to get the soilmoisture deficit to over 10ml to get water levels to begin to rise,” she said.Ms Gannon said there was a base amount of water that is used over a 24-hour period of time. Some of it is usage and some of it is leakage, reducing water pressure overnight helps to reduce both.She said the utility has contacted its top 20 commercial users to determine their commitment to reduce water consumption. Irish Water also has a register of sensitive customers and asked that if anyone is concerned about their supply to get in touch.If anyone suffers a cut in supply, they are also asked to contact the utility.Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy told the Dáil on Thursday water levels were at an all-time low in some parts of the country.He said of the 1,000 water supply systems controlled by Irish Water, nine schemes are currently experiencing severe drought, 51 are in drought condition and a further 77 in potential drought conditions.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3564342.1531504816!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"water restrictions may extend beyond dublin irish water says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish Water said it was impossible to determine at this point how many litres of water would be saved per night as a result of the restrictions. Photograph: Frank MillerIrish Water has indicated there is a possibility of night-time water restrictions extending outside the greater Dublin area.Angela Ryan, water resources manager at the utility, said it was looking at “varying levels of restrictions in various areas”.“We’re looking at resource management right across the country, the amount of water available in supply and the demand for water,” she said. “Right now as part of the existing drought conditions, we’re looking at similar issues right across the country.”A number of areas across the country are already affected by night-time water restrictions from 10pm until 6am, including parts of Carlow, Galway and Limerick.Ms Ryan said the night-time restrictions will allow water conservation be achieved through a combination of reduced usage and leaks from the system.“It will be a combination of both but obviously leakages are over 24 hours and usage tends to be over 12 hours,” she said.Darragh Murphy, communications manager with Irish Water said the restrictions are at night in order to try and limit the impact on homes and businesses.“What we’re trying to do is put on those pressure restrictions and do that at a period of time that least disrupts the economy and people going about their daily lives,” he said.Irish Water said it was impossible to determine at this point how many litres of water would be saved per night as a result of the restrictions.Emma Kennedy, financial analyst and founder of Kenny Analysis, said the utility’s leakage figures were “off the charts”.Irish Water says it plans to reduce water leakage rates from 45 per cent to 38 per cent by 2021. The utility’s managing director, Jerry Grant, said earlier this year the Dublin network has a leakage rate of 37 per cent, amounting to 207 million litres a day.Pipes are being replaced at a rate of 1 per cent a year, the maximum possible “without bringing the city to a standstill”, he said.Ms Kennedy, who has done research on behalf of opponents of the Shannon pipeline plan, told The  “there will be major problems if Irish Water sticks with that target”.She said the 1 per cent replacement target meant “some of them will not to be touched for 100 years”.“Dublin will have a total nightmare in the coming decades with bursts and outages if Irish Water sticks with that target.

Photograph: Jack PowerSinn Féin has decided that it will run a presidential candidate against Michael D Higgins meaning a vote will now definitely take place in the autumn.The decision was taken by Sinn Féin on Saturday after a meeting of the party’s ard comhairle, its executive board.Party leader Mary Lou McDonald told reporters on Saturday the Sinn Féin campaign would focus on having “a wider conversation” about the future direction of the country.“We have appointed a presidential election committee”, she said, which will run the process. The ard comhairle sub-committee will be chaired by David Cullinane TD, and will report in ten days time with a process for how candidates can put their names forward. The ard comhairle will then select a party candidate from the nominees in the next number of weeks.Speaking outside the Hugh Lane Gallery, in Dublin city centre, Ms McDonald said “Ireland and the world have changed very dramatically in the seven years since we last had a presidential election.”People under the age of 25 had never voted in a presidential election, she said, and “shouldn’t have to wait until the age of 32 to have this opportunity.”It would be “wrong” if citizens did not get a vote on the presidency “because the political establishment of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, and Labour do not want an election,” she said.“A new generation has become politically engaged and have been central to changing Ireland for the better,” she said, referencing the marriage equality referendum and the recent vote to repeal the Eighth Amendment.“I want to commend President Higgins and his wife Sabina on how they have represented Ireland during the term of his presidency,” she said, but added the coming campaign “will be about the next seven years.”Ms McDonald said she “would not speculate on inidual names” on who might put themselves forward for selection as the party candidate. Potential runners who have been speculated as being in the frame include MEPs Lynn Boylan and Liadh Ní Ríada.There was a track record of presidential elections being “ugly and adversarial” campaigns, she said. Sinn Féin “will be fighting this campaign to win,” she said.President Higgins officially declared this week that he would nominate himself for a second seven-year term in Áras an Uachtaráin and would stand as an independent candidate.As the incumbent, President Higgins can nominate himself for re-election. Independent Senator Gerard Craughwell has said he is seeking nominations to contest the election, and suicide prevention charity Pieta House founder and Independent Senator Joan Freeman is also thought to be sounding out Oireachtas members for support. Seán Gallagher, who came second to President Higgins in the 2011 election, has written to all local authorities and asked them to facilitate the entry into the race of aspirant candidates.Candidates require the support of 20 Oireachtas members, or four local authorities to secure a nomination.During the 2011 campaign President Higgins committed to only holding the office for one seven-year term, but it had been widely speculated for more than a year in the corridors of Leinster House that he would seek a second term.Former Lord Mayor of Dublin and Independent councillor Christy Burke had considered seeking a nomination in the last number of days, but on Friday ruled himself out.Mr Burke said he had been approached to run by several supporters, but following a “serious amount of consideration” decided against seeking to contest the race. “The financial end of running in the election would only put too much pressure on myself but also on my team,” he said. The Dublin City Council veteran said he hoped the housing crisis would be the main issue of the presidential election campaign.Fine Gael said this week it would canvass for the re-election of President Higgins and may use party resources to assist his campaign for a second term in Áras an Uachtaráin.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has confirmed his party would back Mr Higgins, who this week declared he wants a second seven-year term. The extent of Fine Gael’s campaigning has not yet been decided, but Mr Varadkar indicated it was willing to erect posters and use party literature to support Mr Higgins.Fianna Fáil, which is also backing Mr Higgins, is unlikely to follow suit, sources said, but the President’s former colleagues in the Labour Party will.Independent members of the Oireachtas are attempting to harness support from members of the Dáil, Seanad and county councils as they seek to field a presidential competitor."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"digitalservices@telegraphHead of Digital Publishingdigitalservices@telegraphMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

But, the US did not threaten Russia in the same manner.\u0026nbspAn unnamed Russian delegate said the country stepped up to back and help pass the resolution because they felt\u0026nbsp “it is wrong when a big country tries to push around some very small countries, especially on an issue that is really important for the rest of the world.The delegation was also opposed to another section of the resolution which called on countries to curtail promotion of products that medical experts agreed could cause harm to children according to more than a dozen delegates to the health meeting, the majority of whom requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from the US, according to the newspaper.Though US\u0026nbspefforts were unsuccessful since the bulk of the original wording survived two whole days of procedural talks, language calling for “inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children to end was removed due to US efforts.\u0026nbspThe US mission to the UN nor the State Department responded to a request for comment.\u0026nbspIt appeared,\u0026nbsphowever, the US was asking to have the language removed as a sign of support for the $70bn\u0026nbspinfant formula industry which relies on mothers not exclusively breastfeeding.

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies. There’s even a new trade body, the Influencer Marketing Association.Circle the wagons and don’t be a #filterfaker\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspthe wild influencer west is being tamed.Cannes Lions International Festival of CreativityEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Discovering how quickly it has been growing since the big bang\u0026nbsp13.8 billion years ago could answer the most fundamental questions about where the universe came from and where it is going.But as the measurements have become more precise, they have also become more different. The results that come out of the different ways of measuring the rate of expansion are at odds with each other.Astronomers have a picture of where the universe was near its beginning, and a measurement of how fast it has expanded since – with those, they should be able to predict where it is now, but the result they get is wrong. That suggests there is either something wrong with the measurements, or with our understanding of the universe.Scientists had initially been concerned that the discrepancy was the result of an error in one or more of the ways that they are trying to measure the constant. But the new research suggests that is not the case, and that the measurements are correct – but that something undiscovered is changing the way the universe is expanding.One measurement comes from\u0026nbspESA\u0027s Planck mission, which mapped the universe as it looked only 360,000 years after it came into being. By looking at that map, scientists can work out the speed at which the universe came to be where it is today.But the new Nasa research shows that the expansion rate calculated from that data does not match up with the universe as we see it around us. The new data from the Hubble Space Telescope does not match up with the calculations from the Planck mission.The tension seems to have grown into a full-blown incompatibility between our views of the early and late time universe, said team leader and Nobel Laureate Adam Riess of the Space Telescope Science Institute and the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. At this point, clearly it\u0027s not simply some gross error in any one measurement.It\u0027s as though you predicted how tall a child would become from a growth chart and then found the adult he or she became greatly exceeded the prediction.

It is the largest civilian ship to be built in the UK for 30 years, according to the British Antarctic Survey.The 10,000-tonne hull of the vessel was launched on the River Mersey at 12.25pm, after which it was towed away for the next stages of construction. The ship is scheduled to come into use in 2019.We\u0027ll take her up into the Arctic and test her performance in the floes and that will give us a really good yardstick to know how far we can push this vessel.

It doesn’t matter what people say – the council leader had made up his mind, he said. He claimed the decision was based not on animal welfare grounds but was being used as “a political whip to kick people, especially Muslims and Jews”.The Lancashire Council of Mosques says halal means animal slaughter processes “must avoid all forms of stunning and the animal must be alive prior to slaughter”. The rules add:The slaughterman must personally invoke the name of Allah prior to every slaughterThe slaughterman must conduct the slaughter manually and swiftly with a sharp knifeThe slaughterman must sever at least three of the four arteriesGeoff Driver, leader of Lancashire council, said there was “much debate about what constitutes halal” and noted that in some countries “all animals must be stunned before slaughter”.A council spokesman said the move was not a “ban” because schools were free to stop using its catering service, and that its decision was based entirely on animal-welfare grounds.Asked why the decision was made in the face of opposition from two in three respondents, he said the consultation was not about whether to implement the move but about the effect it would have.Mr Driver said: We accept that a small number of schools may choose to use different suppliers for halal meat.“However, we hope that people understand how the council has arrived at this decision, which has been taken solely on the grounds of animal welfare with due consideration for the impacts outlined in the responses to the consultation.We would like to work with the Lancashire Council of Mosques to ensure that the meals we supply to the affected schools in future provide a range of nutritious options which satisfy students\u0027 dietary requirements and are acceptable to LCM, parents and governors.\u0026nbspHe added: The contract becoming due for renewal has given us the opportunity to consider the animal welfare issues surrounding the supply of halal meat, and on this basis the cabinet has voted to support the council\u0027s previous resolution not to supply unstunned meat, other than poultry, to our schools.”Mr Qureshi said they had offered to sit with council leaders to debate stunning processes - but said his group was not prepared to compromise on its no-stun position.He added that stunning animals was “unhygienic” as blood is believed to carry disease so should be drained from a carcass.The Humanists UK group strongly backed the council’s move, pointing out that polling by the British Veterinary Association revealed that 64 per cent of vets believed that welfare at the time of slaughter, specifically a requirement for stunning, should be a priority.16 Cincinnati Zoo worker shots and kills Harambe, the 17-year-old gorillaHarambe, a 17-year-old gorilla was shot and killed by a Cincinnati Zoo worker after a three-year-old boy climbed into a gorilla enclosure and was grabbed and dragged by Harambe.

Both adult brown bears had been donated to Bern’s Dählhölzli zoo in 2009.In response to the consultation, the group said: “By providing non-stunned meat in its schools, Lancashire county council is arguably acting as an accessory to a breach of the law since the exemption from the requirement for animals to be stunned is explicitly only ‘for the food of Jews’ or ‘for the food of Muslims’,” and some meat would be eaten by children not from these groups.The policy begins at the start of the new school term in September.Dr Nick Palmer, of Compassion in World Farming, said: We fully recognise the importance of religious communities being able to practice their religion - this a central value of our society. However, this is balanced by the need to avoid slaughtering animals in ways that modern science has shown to entail great suffering.\u0026nbsp“Lancashire county council is introducing not a ban on halal meat, but a ban on unstunned halal meat. We believe there should be no exemptions, and the law should be changed to require all animals to be effectively stunned before slaughter, regardless of the slaughter method that is then used.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Ethiopia and Eritrea have not had diplomatic ties since the war began in 1998, with Mr Ahmed\u0026nbsphimself fighting in a town that remains contested today, and the countries have skirmished since then in one of Africa’s longest-running conflicts.Mr Ahmed’s chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, said on Twitter that the visit aims to “further deepen efforts to bring about lasting peace.” He shared photos of the leaders’ meeting and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas “very warmly received” by Mr Afwerki.“Our two nations share a history and bond like no other,” he said. “We can now overcome two decades of mistrust and move in a new direction.”Ethiopia’s foreign ministry called the visit “part of efforts to normalise relations with Eritrea” and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas expected to talk with Eritrea’s leadership about “how to mend fences”.One Eritrean diplomat, its ambassador to Japan Estifanos Afeworki, said on Twitter that “no leader has received such a warm welcome like today in Asmara in the history of Eritrea”.Ethiopians expressed welcome shock at the meeting, which was shown live by Ethiopia’s state TV.“Historic ... the beginning of the end. The glass ceiling has been broken,” one resident, Shewit Wudassie, wrote on Facebook. Another Facebook user, Djphat Su, wrote: “Am I dreaming or what?”The decision to fully accept the peace deal was the biggest and most surprising reform yet announced by Ethiopia’s 42-year-old prime minister, who took office in April and quickly set off a wave of reforms, freeing journalists and opposition figures from prison, opening up the state-run economy and unblocking hundreds of websites after years of anti-government protests demanding more freedoms.World news in picturesA model poses during the annual \u0027World Bodypainting Festival\u0027 in Klagenfurt, AustriaFirefighters using fire helicopters fighting wildfires in Sordal in Setesdalen in the southern part of Norway.

That’s the question at the heart of the Malala Fund, the organisation set up by Malala Yousafzai, the young Nobel Prize winner. And she wants to provide this education in parts of the world where it can\u0027t be taken for granted. Luckily, she has a powerful ally.In January, Apple revealed a tie-up with Malala Fund as part of the initial goal of getting 100,000 girls into education in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Lebanon, Turkey and Nigeria. But today it has been announced that the collaboration is expanding to Latin America.This expansion means grants will be offered to advocates in Brazil, who will join the Malala Fund\u0027s network of so-called Gulmakai Champions. Their job: to implement projects created to empower girls, for example, through school enrolment efforts and developing skills development.And in Brazil there will also be a connection to the Apple Developer Academy students, encouraging those students to design new apps that can affect girls’ education – Malala dropped in on the Academy in Rio to launch this.I talked to Lisa Jackson, vice\u0026nbsppresident of environment, policy and social initiatives at Apple, about their connection. Ms Jackson, who previously ran the Environment Protection Agency for President Obama, is a persuasive advocate for Apple\u0027s involvement with Malala Fund, combining a forensic grasp of detail with an enthusiasm that is infectious.I think the wonderful thing about this partnership is that Apple is very much in the supporting role, she explains. Here’s an astounding young leader in her fairly young organisation. We have seen part of our role is to help build the base of support, so it can be around for a long time and be as effective as possible. We share the Malala Fund goal, which is for every girl to receive 12 years of quality education.Back in January, I met Ms Jackson, along with Apple CEO Tim Cook and Malala Yousafzai, in Beirut, when their tie-up was first announced. It was a remarkable day, with a group of Lebanese girl students who were thrilled to meet Malala – some burst into tears in their excitement when they discovered who was coming.When I spoke to Cook and Malala then, they talked about their commitment to this new initiative with considerable passion. The Malala Fund is trying to reach out to girls, as many as we can, to empower them through quality education. That was my dream, explained Malala.Malala breaks down in tears as she returns to Pakistan for first time since Taliban attackBut what has happened in the intervening months? Since it was first announced there have been many meetings, and collaborations and visits on both sides of the Atlantic between Malala Fund, and us,” says Jackson. There is a partnership which is now bigger than financial, including hardware and equipment, but which now extends to ways to try to engage our ecosystem.Throughout, Apple has refused to say exactly how much money it is giving. We’re not talking about a dollar commitment, Jackson says. It’s substantial, but this is much bigger than dollars. It’s dollars, it’s equipment but probably most important, it’s our ecosystem and support.This echoes Cook: We have expertise in education. We’ve built an expertise of what our products can do in a teaching environment and how they can fuel student achievement. And we have touched a significant number of people with our coding initiative. Of course, we have an expertise in scaling and we have lots of people in different countries across the world. So, it seemed like the most important things to me are always the values and the vision. It seemed like we could bring a lot in support of Malala\u0027s vision.”At the launch Malala added:\u0026nbspI\u0027m hoping that through partnership with Apple we\u0027ll be able to expand our work and we want to double our Gulmakai champions, who are the local advocates who are supporting the students, from six to 11 countries. I want to teach 100,000 girls and I want to involve girls and make sure that they can get quality education.Malala Yousafzai: her story so farNobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, activist for female education, in Nigeria in 2017.

I ask Jackson how that\u0027s going. We set the humble goal of reaching 100,000 girls in a year and I have no doubt that will be beaten. Apple has very much taken a supporting role in this, wanting to create something sustainable and which can be scaled.”This time around there\u0027s a different approach, as Jackson explains. There are more Gulmakai champions being added but we came up with an idea together that one of the things we could also add was the app ecosystem. We have 10 Apple Developer Academies in Brazil that have been there for a number of years. There are 500 students enrolled there now but hundreds more alumni, many of whom have just amazing stories and we’ve found that with these students at the app developer academies, we get great results when we frame things in terms of creating apps designed to change the world for the better.This seems like a smart move: the Apple App Store reaches hundreds of millions of iPhone users, for instance, so the right app can make a real difference. App developers are ingenious at seeing things in a different way - and at Apple\u0027s World Wide Developers\u0027 Conference last month in San Jose, 75 students from the Brazil academies attended as scholarship winners.Taliban leader who ordered hit on Malala killed in US drone strikeMalala Yousafzai returns to Pakistan for first time since shootingMalala says men like Trump should \u0027think about their daughters\u0027Malala and Apple team up to help at least 100,000 girls into educationThe incredible life of Nobel Prize winner Malala YousafzaiJackson says: So, we thought, let’s get Malala’s vision in front of them. Today, she’s been to visit one of the 10 schools, one in Rio de Janeiro, to challenge them to develop apps that affect girls’ education. Then Malala Fund will work over the course of the year to adapt these apps to make them impactful and judge which ones they want to use. It really is an amazing part of the partnership that goes beyond the classic donation of money and really goes to the heart of what Apple is about, to empower a person, giving any person the tools to pursue their passion.The challenge will also encourage students to find ways to better enable Malala Fund’s Gulmakai champions network around the world to communicate and share best practices in a secure environment.That challenge is only just beginning. But Malala has clear ideas about what it might achieve. “My hope is that every girl, from Rio to Riyadh, can be free to choose her own future,” Malala has said. “Whether she wants to be a developer, a pilot, a dancer or a politician, education is the best path to a brighter future. By tapping into Apple’s network of student developers, Malala Fund will gain access to new tools to support our mission of free, safe, quality education. The students in Apple’s Developer Academy programme share my passion for improving the world around us, and I am eager to see their innovative ideas to help girls in Brazil and across the globe.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Co-Director of Together For Yes Ailbhe Smyth speaks to the media after exit polls suggested victory for the Yes campaign.The demand is likely to cause friction with Italy’s European partners where migration is a source of internal political tension.Last week, Germany, Austria and Italy said they would hold talks in Innsbruck about how to shut down the Mediterranean route.Germany wants to process refugees in police facilities within 48 hours on its southern border with Austria, and in turn Austria has said it may be forced to protect its own southern border with Italy and Slovenia to stop migrants transiting from the south.Italy’s transport ministry last month said it wanted the EU border agency, Frontex, to stop working in the Mediterranean. Frontex runs an operation off the coast of Italy that works closely with the local coast guard.The EU missions have helped rescue thousands of refugees\u0026nbspat sea, all of whom were disembarked in Italy. Spokespeople at Frontex and Sophia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Italy has so far refused to take back any migrants stopped at the German border.“Before receiving even one asylum seeker from another European country, we want to see a precise commitment – giving the timetable, costs, means, men and resources –\u0026nbspon how the EU plans to help us defend our external borders,” Mr Salvini said last week.Aid groups and United Nations’ agencies on Friday asked Italy open its ports to rescue ships because the policy could have a high human cost. More migrants could die at sea, or they could be trapped indefinitely in inhumane detention centres, they said.On Sunday, Mr Salvini said the previous government had agreed to welcome migrants rescued by ships participating in the EU sea missions.Mr Salvini said: “With our government, the music has changed and will change”.This comes after a rescue boat carrying 60 refugees arrived in Barcelona last week after being turned away by Italy and Malta.The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, came to the ship’s rescue when she, with permission from the Spanish government, told the crew of the vessel that it could dock.\u0026nbspThe boat, which was said to have had five women, a nine-year-old and four teenagers on board, was turned away by Mr Salvini.He said the rescue boat “can forget about arriving in an Italian port” and then suggested the boat should dock in Malta which he claimed was the nearest port.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

All French parties are entitled to money in proportion to the number of votes it receives.The party, which recently changed its name from National Front to National Rally in an attempt to distance itself from racist and antisemitic associations, has long suffered from financial problems.In 2014 it took a loan from a Russian bank, saying it had been refused credit in France. Several banks, including France’s Société Générale and HSBC, refused to open accounts for the party last year.World news in picturesA model poses during the annual \u0027World Bodypainting Festival\u0027 in Klagenfurt, AustriaFirefighters using fire helicopters fighting wildfires in Sordal in Setesdalen in the southern part of Norway.

Indeed we don’t know how Mrs May intends to win that support back.But the harsh reality is that if Tories engage in a full-blooded rebellion they could kill Brexit and gift Corbyn power.They must think again.REMAINER critics piled into Boris Johnson and David Davis. Strangely they are mute about the Brussels buffoons far less statesmanlike than either.Consider the odious Jean-Claude Juncker’s snarky jibe at our Cabinet’s “unity” after Boris’s resignation. Or Donald Tusk gleefully speculating that the biggest democratic vote ever held in Britain could yet be over-ridden.Imagine the furore if a Tory Secretary of State publicly sneered at Brussels for its own disunity, the mass eurozone unemployment, the migration disaster and the rise of extremism.Yes, our Government’s dithering, and the loss of its majority, has contributed to the Brexit chaos.But the EU’s habitually abusive clowns have always been the biggest obstacles to a decent deal and cordial relations.THE word “heroes” is overused. But the divers who rescued 12 lads from a flooded Thai cave are the definition.For 18 days the world has watched this incredible story and prayed for the children. We can only now marvel at the rescuers’ grit, their expertise and the courage of the kids themselves.As for the Brits who spearheaded the operation to save the boys . . . they are why bravery medals and OBEs are minted.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in practice, how does that work given that most sexual encounters are one-on-one with no witnesses?She can still say yes at the time then later pretend she didn’t and falsely accuse him of rape.And equally, he could pretend she had consented when, in fact, she had screamed no.Perhaps we are moving to an era when all young people will feel compelled to temporarily stall a moment of passion so they can film the consenting “yes” on their mobile phones? Or failing that, perhaps have a solicitor present.ACTRESS Paula Williamson wed “Britain’s most violent prisoner” Charles Bronson last November and said she looked forward to him getting out so they could enjoy a normal marriage.Yet just two months later he allegedly attacked the deputy governor of HMP Wakefield and now, just before appearing via video link at Leeds magistrates court, he tried to take his guards hostage in his cell.Hmmmm. Something tells me that – after spending 42 years inside – 65-year-old Charlie boy has become institutionalised and doesn’t actually want to come out, hence the litany of violent episodes that keep him in trouble and constantly embarrass his trusting wife.It gives a whole new meaning to the term blushing bride.NEW research shows that the ability to ward off fear and unhappiness is a skill that improves markedly with age.An American neuroscientist says the reaction of the old and the young to, say, the imminent results of an election were significantly different.That’s because, when you’ve seen a few governments come and go, we of a certain age eventually realise they’re all as useless as each other and whatever we say or do to try to change that has no effect at all.But if it turns out to be a France v England final, I may be heading home sooner than expected.FORMER Radio 1 DJ “Diddy” David Hamilton has weighed in to the #MeToo debate with his recollection of his Seventies heyday, saying: “We didn’t go around forcing ourselves on women.“It sounds conceited to say it but we didn’t have to because a lot of women were forcing themselves on us.”Meanwhile, Kinks frontman Sir Ray Davies reveals: “A world-famous groupie once threw me out because I was too kind.”A reminder, if needed, that not all men are b******s and not all women are innocent victims.And if further proof is required, look no further than some of the predatory females stalking their male prey on Love Island each night.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will we be able to sign our own trade deals? And will the UK be outside the jurisdiction of the European Court?I’m very pleased to say the answers are very simple: yes, yes and yes.First, it will mean a genuine end to freedom of movement.No longer will people be allowed to arrive here from across Europe on the off-chance that they might find a job.We will always welcome the skilled professionals who help our country thrive, from doctors and nurses to engineers and entrepreneurs but for the first time in decades, we will have full control of our borders.And it will be the UK, not Brussels, that decides who should be allowed to live and work here.Second, we will have our own completely independent trade policy, our own seat at the World Trade Organisation and the ability to set tariffs and strike trade deals with whoever we please.British goods and services are in huge demand internationally, so it’s no surprise that countries are queuing up to make trade deals with us after we leave the EU.We are having good discussions with countries we would aim to sign trade deals with, including the US, as I will discuss with President Trump when he arrives in the UK on Thursday.Third, our plan will take back control of our laws.We will no longer be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union, instead, British judges in British courts will rule on our laws.And while we will commit to have common rules with the EU on things like exhaust emissions and food safety, Parliament will have to agree these rules.Put simply, such EU rules will no longer automatically and directly apply in the UK — Parliament will have a say.It’s clear to me that this is the right Brexit deal for Britain, although there are, of course, some alternatives.The EU’s preferred option — a standard, off-the-shelf trade deal for Great Britain with Northern Ireland in the customs union and parts of the single market — would break up our country.The other option the EU suggests, a combination of EEA membership with continued membership of the customs union, would not be Brexit at all.We would have no control over immigration, no ability to strike our own trade deals, and would still be liable for vast annual payments to Brussels.And while we must prepare for the possibility of leaving without a deal, I’m clear that the best outcome — for both the UK and the EU — is a deal based on the ideas we are setting out on Thursday.As for Labour, they are opening the door to a second referendum — ignoring the decision taken by the country and making it harder to get a good deal.Only our Brexit deal for Britain truly respects the will of the British people.And, as Prime Minister, it is the Brexit I am determined to deliver.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sometimes that’s the only way to sort stuff out.That’s what the US President Donald Trump is doing right now with his Nato allies. And it’s a mighty big sledgehammer.In the firing line is Angela Merkel, of Germany. And the other countries that are backsliding on their commitment to the civilised world’s safety and security.Trump thinks — and he’s right — that for far too long Europe and Canada have not been paying their share for our military defence. The Germans pay nowhere near enough. But even worse are the Belgians.Incredibly, Canada, led by that simpering idiot Justin Trudeau, spends scarcely more than one per cent of its GDP on defence. One of the richest countries on the world. The Spanish, as you might expect, pay four fifths of sod all. LESS than one per cent.Trump is telling them all they cannot depend on America any more. The US spends 3.5 per cent of its enormous GDP on the military. Much more than any other country in Nato.And as a consequence, Western Europe (and Canada) has been safe for decades. It was US military spending which led to the end of the Cold War and ultimately the break up of the “evil empire”, the Soviet Union.So where do we stand in all this? We spend more per head than our European partners, Estonia and Greece excepted. But still just the bare minimum of two per cent of GDP.And for years now we’ve been reducing our defence budgets. Cutting our armed services to the bone. Take the Royal Navy. In the 36 years since the Falklands War the number of warships we possess has reduced by a staggering 74 per cent.We now have a Navy which is 25 per cent smaller than it was in 1650 — when we had only a tenth of our current population. We were once a great maritime power. Today we’d do well to win a naval battle against Luxembourg — and that’s landlocked.Military spending does not create wars. It does the opposite. It makes them much, much less likely.The Falklands War against Argentina occurred because we had cut our spending on the Navy to the point where we no longer defended the far-flung islands. The Argies saw their chance and invaded.Luckily we still had a big enough Navy to respond and win back the freedom for the Falklanders. We couldn’t even dream of doing the same thing now.Meanwhile, the RAF has seen its number of combat aircraft cut by more than one third in less than ten years. We now have just 149. You probably saw them during the flypast on Tuesday, if you live in London. That was the lot. That’s it.The first duty of any government is to protect its citizens. The US does that and we should do so, too — never mind the backsliding Europeans.The world is no less of a dangerous place than it was 30 or 60 years ago. Trump has got this absolutely right.NAZ SHAH is a Labour MP. Not so long ago she was suspended from the party.She had agreed with the foul and offensive idea that Israel should be “relocated” to the USA.Shah also compared the Israeli government to Adolf Hitler. Now she’s back in the party – and guess what? She’s been given a front bench role. As shadow equalities minister!They certainly take anti-Semitism seriously in Corbyn’s Labour Party. Surely there cannot be any Jewish people left in the country who would vote for this racist rabble.I’VE seen many remarkable things in my life. I’ve watched my team, Millwall, play in an FA Cup Final.I’ve seen the sun set at lunchtime in the Arctic Circle. I’ve talked to Arab terrorists, American presidents and famous pop singers. But there’s one thing I’ve never done.I have never, ever, in my entire life, met anyone who liked Danny Dyer. I was at party last week with people from all walks of life, and Danny’s name came up.The reaction was immediate. “Oh Christ, not that d**k . . .I think one woman even went behind a bush to be sick. Anyway, just thought I’d mention that.Maybe one day I will meet someone who likes Danny Dyer. And my life will be complete.IMPORTANT news story. Emily Ratajkowski is on holiday.We know this because she has very kindly sent the world some photographs of her break.But I will make sure to send back to The Sun some snaps of me lying on a sunbed with my a*se in the air, or posing in something alluring by a pool with a big pout on my chops. Enjoy.The EUS chief negotiator, Michel barnier wit Jeane-Claude Juncker - and the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel.And that, frankly, is all you need to knowBEST news of the week, maybe of the year, was the heroic rescue of those young Thai kids from a flooded cave complex.It was an enormous, dangerous and brilliantly executed plan to get them out.And now, guess what? Hollywood is going to make a film about it all.YOU know the score, I don’t.All of my Wednesday is spent in a state of mental torture.What if we don’t crock Modric early on? When’s Harry going to start scoring again?I know the World Cup has been great fun. But does anybody actually ENJOY watching England – unless they’re 3-0 up? It’s too terrifying.Anyway, apparently there is a sharp rise in the birth rate when England win important football matches.Blokes take to their beds filled with passion.Me too, as it happens. And I like to relive the match by providing a loud commentary, in the manner of Jonathan Pearce, while I’m on the job.“Oh, just look at Liddle! He’s found a way through – AND IT’S IN!”ITALY has just turned away another ship full of migrants. It had been chartered by one of the many leftie charities bobbing about in the Med.Isn’t it time these mor- ons were prosecuted for people trafficking? Migrants now set off expecting to be picked up. Many die en route.It’s time to get tough. First, remove their charitable status. Next, fine them or close them down.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The veteran German MEP sits on the EU Parliament’s steering group on Brexit and wields significant influence in Berlin.His remarks will provide welcome cheer to the Government after its plans were trashed by US President Donald Trump in a sensational interview with The Sun. Mr Brok told German media: “This is a proposal that can’t be implemented par for par, but it’s nevertheless a good basis for negotiation.“It’s a reasonable approach. It hasn’t been talked about yet, but it really could be a breakthrough. We should really take this up constructively. Theresa May has obviously recognised the problems that come to Britain in a hard Brexit.”The comments come just days after it was claimed the PM told Ministers she coulnd’t alter parts of her Brexit plan as she’d already “cleared it” with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Mr Brok also predicted the PM would win against any leadership challenger and “then have a majority in parliament for better relations with the EU”. A senior EU official told The Sun it was “quite clear” that eurocrats needed to work constructively on the UK’s proposals.They said: “All the reactions for the time being were positive, because there’s indeed a shift in position, but also cautious. “The normal thing to do now is talk and let’s see what we can do. We’ll have to see if this can work. It’s quite clear we have to work on this.“The member states are cautious on this. Nobody wants to destroy the negotiation before it’s even begun.”Meanwhile, France’s finance minister Bruno Le Maire boasted a “significant number” of banks are relocating from London to Paris due to Brexit.

She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and died a few days later. Gemma was just 40 years old.Simon had to tell their eight- year-old son Ethan that his mum was dead, and the two of them have been trying to cope ever since.Everyone mourns the death of someone they have loved and adored in different ways.There’s no timetable for grief, and no “one size fits all” way to get through the whole soul-crushing experience. For Simon, the death of his wife felt like a physical illness and being in intensive care.He decided to leave his job at Sky Sports to be with Ethan full time and they now both have an unbreakable bond.Simon is obviously very ­protective of his young son, but that works both ways.Ethan will often tell his dad that he is OK even when he is really suffering and missing his mum, because he doesn’t want Simon to worry about him, or to add to his dad’s pain.He sounds like a remarkable young lad who is a credit to both of his parents.For Simon, one of the worst things about Gemma’s death is the acute loneliness.After he has put Ethan to bed and he is in the living room, there’s no Gemma on the sofa watching TV or just chatting about the mundane events of the day.He often breaks down while making dinner for two rather than three, or emptying the dishwasher or doing other household tasks they used to share but that he now has to do by himself.It’s those little things that bind us together, and that we miss so very much.Simon told me that there are those who have simply not been in touch since Gemma died. It’s not because they don’t care, but because they just don’t know what to say to him and Ethan.It was interesting to hear him say that the most comforting sympathy he received was from a woman he bumped into in the supermarket, who knew Gemma from meeting her at the school gate.She simply told him that it was “utter crap, totally unfair and completely f*****g hellish”.And it is.When someone you love dies, it is utterly s**t and it does no harm to say that.Telling a bereaved person you are sorry for their “loss” is well meaning and comes with the best possible intentions, but we “lose” car keys, credit cards and dog leads.Those we loved are ripped from our arms and our hearts and it feels like the end of the world.Those feelings don’t really ever go away — you just somehow learn to live with them.We need to somehow try to make that process more bearable. So don’t avoid a devastated husband, a mother whose child has died or an elderly widow who is mourning her soul-mate.Talk to them and check in with them, because one day you will need them to comfort you.Essie, portrayed by Kaye Wragg, above, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had to undergo a complete hysterectomy, giving her no chance of ever having a much-yearned-for child of her own.Kaye gave her usual cracking performance, utterly believable and deeply moving. This storyline will have helped raise awareness of a cancer that is known as the “silent killer”.I hope we see more of Essie, as I always looked upon her as the quiet heart of Holby.If you missed this episode, make sure you go to the BBC iPlayer to catch up.WE’VE all had them – those house guests who overstay their welcome and are a complete pain in the bum.The disgruntled visitors who don’t like the food and complain the bed is too hard and won’t do a hand’s turn to help with the dishes or buy the odd loaf or bottle of wine.The ones where you do a jig when they have left and vow: “Never again.”So I sympathise with poor Mr and Mrs May, who have been putting up with the Trumps – veritable guests from hell.He’s the worst possible bullying boaster and you can imagine him dominating the conversation and being demanding and boorish.She has all the personality of a fembot and looks bored and disinterested at all times.Having the Trumps to stay was never going to be the easiest of rides for our PM and her husband.Aside from the thorny political discussions – and this week he has ripped up the rulebook and sold her down the river – there’s the distressing business of making small talk with this odd couple.I can just imagine Donald blowharding and manaplaining over pre- dinner drinks while poor Theresa becomes even more strained and develops a red stress rash on her neck.Her hubby Philip probably ended up talking to Melania about the weather.Trump has to be kept entertained like some bored little emperor, but you don’t want him to have too good a time that he will want to visit again soon.It’s a thorny one.Theresa has had the toughest of times recently, but she is made of strong stuff. While she might look a little tired around the eyes, our PM is no quitter – unlike the men who have let her down and put their own interests above those of the country.It might be trivial but I hope our PM can take some comfort in the fact she looked sensational in that sizzling red dress she wore to greet Trump.Theresa won the style battle with much younger ex-model Melania, who looked like a cut-price Belle from Disney’s Beauty And The Beast.Although Trump got it spot on as the Beast.FOR once this week, it wasn’t some poor actress who’d eaten a bowl of pasta for lunch and had a small, rounded belly being body-shamed.Russell Crowe was the subject of gleeful mirth by people who feel better about themselves by mocking others.Admittedly, the former buff star of Gladiator has piled on the pounds and looks like Thomas Markle’s older, larger brother. But by all accounts he’s chunked up for a movie role.Gladiator was 18 years ago and even Hollywood stars grow older and bigger. It appears, however, that equality in Tinseltown now means both women AND men being derided for not remaining visions of perfection and having the audacity to age.TODAY Serena Williams strides on to Centre Court to play for her eighth Wimbledon Ladies singles title.I have never seen a more majestic athlete on a tennis court since the heady days of my girl crush, Martina Navratilova.Serena is simply sensational and being a mother has made her even more hungry to win.It’s astonishing to think that just ten months ago, after the traumatic birth of her daughter and following multiple surgeries, she could hardly walk.Despite all she has gone through, I’ve never seen any athlete better prepared physically but also mentally.Serena can taste that title and no one is going to get in her way.I don’t envy her opponent, Angelique Kerber, today as it’s not just Wimbledon up for grabs.Serena also has her 24th singles grand slam in her sights, which would equal the record set by Margaret Court.Mrs Court was a hell of a tennis player but, as it turns out, not a great human being.She is a self-styled pastor in Australia and her views on gay rights and same-sex marriage are deeply distasteful.She claimed transgender children are the work of the devil, leading Martina Navratilova to label her “racist and homophobic”.So for that and so many other reasons, I’m firmly backing Serena today.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was also Donald Trump’s view in The Sun.But yesterday the PM convinced him otherwise. And she insisted “there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the world”.How are both positions possible? How will we enjoy such flexibility?How will our courts be supreme if we still heed ECJ rulings? How will we have total control of immigration if some EU workers can still come in as they see fit? And what will she do next if Brussels rejects it all?Leave voters’ rising anger is fuelled by the suspicion that behind the repeated assurances we are being stitched up.Mrs May must explain why we’re not. Explain how she talked round a doubting Trump. Explain how we will seize the opportunities Brexit presents. If she wants to admit her plan isn’t ideal but it’s the best there is, this is her moment.It’s time for honesty, not spin. The PM owes it to Britain. DO Remainers really not get the difference between President Obama giving his view on Brexit and President Trump doing so?Obama was egged on by Downing Street in 2016 to try to skew a democratic vote in favour of one side. He told us, falsely, that backing Brexit would put us last in the queue for a US trade deal.Trump’s argument in The Sun two years AFTER the vote was simply that Leave won and he doubted Mrs May’s strategy would fulfil on the verdict.He may be wrong.

Because once Trump replaced him, Britain hit the front of the US queue — a position only now threatened by staying tied to Brussels.Happy to help, Remain fans. WE wondered if President Trump might try to shoot the messenger when he realised how embarrassing his world exclusive Sun interview was to his host Mrs May.We’re used to that, of course.

It is difficult to keep focus after 20 minutes and very easy to be hypnotised by the motion of the sea and you glaze over in the glare.I have an active mind while swimming and I like to keep track of my thoughts. Occasionally I stop to shout a word or phrase for the crew to write down - something to trigger my memory later.The stream of consciousness can get quite interesting! Today was the first time we have encountered big ships - there was a row of three oil tankers anchored on the eastern end of the bay.Now heading back to Mullion Cove again, we will be heading back out in the late afternoon to pick up the GPS point for the evening swim.Overall, a phenomenal morning swim and it feels as though we are banking kilometres. All happy on board.I am back in the water this evening and hopefully this will take us to the edge of Lizard Point.:: Day two - 8 miles (12.8km) Another two good sessions in the morning and evening, in very fair conditions. I will be doing two swims a day and slingshotting around Land\u0027s End.I had a few periods of jellyfish activity - the biggest we saw was longer than our shortest crew member.I was stung on my arms, which we treated with vinegar after I got out of the water - it made me smell of fish and chips!We ended up setting up a jellyfish watch, with spotters armed with whistles.:: Day one - 6 miles (9.8km) Today was a day of ironing out the swim procedures. This involved working out communication between me in the water and my team, adhering to the verification protocols, working out actual distance covered versus distance swum - it\u0027s difficult to swim in an exact straight line.In total I manage to cover 6 miles (9.8km) of my journey, although this is less than the actual distance I swam.This was the first day when all nine members of the campaign were on board, and over the next few days we will learn much about the teamwork and processes that will help us get through the entire expedition.:: The eve of the swimYou are either a pioneer or a follower you can\u0027t be both. And if you are a pioneer, you know all about worry.If something has been done before, you know it\u0027s possible. If you don\u0027t know something is possible, you worry about it.I\u0027m about to embark on a swim with significant risks and consequences - financial, reputational and environmental. So there hasn\u0027t been a night in the last month that I haven\u0027t woken up.A few nights ago I was using the worry hours to plan, and remembered something Mike Tyson once said: \"Everyone\u0027s got a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\" I have a plan to try and swim 10km per day. But when I swim into my first bloom of jellyfish, that plan will become flexible.I know that I\u0027m going to get sunburnt. I\u0027m going to be frozen, I\u0027m going to be stung, and I\u0027m going to become mentally and physically exhausted. Have I done too much preparation, or not enough?What if we get the tides wrong, get caught in a counter eddy and find ourselves going backwards? This is a notoriously dangerous coastline, with the shipwrecks to prove it.Did I mention that half my expedition team is new, and half has no sailing experience?In those waking worry hours I also remembered the Stockdale paradox. Admiral Stockdale was an American pilot who was shot down in Vietnam and spent eight years in a POW camp. He said that the people who survived had two important qualities.First, they always believed they would be freed. Second - and this is the paradox - they had no optimism. Because the people who did have optimism - the people who hoped they would be free by Easter, then by Thanksgiving, then by Christmas, and had those hopes dashed over and over again - those people didn\u0027t survive. The people who survived were the ones who confronted the brutal reality of their situation.I have to face some brutal facts when I look at the chart of our 560km swim route. This is the longest swim anyone has ever done, adhering to Channel Rules in water this low temperature. I honestly don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to do this. But I do believe I\u0027ll see the white cliffs of Dover. So that\u0027s the paradox that\u0027s going through my mind.The swimming is only part of the challenge. We\u0027ve also had to co-ordinate with sponsors, raise funds for the expedition, recruit the right people for the team, and deal with the media... all the while juggling private lives with unexpected domestic crises. As if all that wasn\u0027t enough, after six months of campaign planning and preparation, we learned that Donald Trump is coming to London on the day I start swimming. We certainly hadn\u0027t planned on such a big media story distracting from our message.Because the message is the reason I am doing this swim. The truth is we are failing our oceans. And it\u0027s only through bold and courageous action that we\u0027re going to be able to protect them properly. \"Piecemeal\" protection is not going to safeguard our seas. We need an enormous shift in business and government and the public to be able to do this.There are challenges ahead. But as English Channel crossing pioneer Captain Webb said, nothing great is ever easy.I\u0027ll keep that in mind as I strike out for Dover."},{"url":null,"title":"13 toe curling moments donald","story":"News13 toe-curling moments from Donald Trump\u0027s astonishing lovebomb press conference with Theresa MayDonald Trump has lovebombed Theresa May on his UK visit in a fawning, hour-long press conference after his shocking attack over Brexit.

Donald Trump has lovebombed Theresa May in a fawning, hour-long press conference in a bid to dig his way out of a shocking attack over Brexit. Last night the US President kicked off his UK visit with a bang by pouring cold water on the Prime Minister\u0027s \u0027soft\u0027 plan for leaving the EU. As they dined on strawberries and ice cream at a lavish banquet, it emerged he\u0027d said her scheme would kill any trade deal with the US. Today, in the hot sunshine of her Chequers garden, Trump smiled sweetly in a reverse ferret on a scale only he is capable of.  But he also created new headaches for the PM by casually ruling out a No Deal Brexit, repeating that Boris Johnson could be in No10, and lying - again. Here are the most toe-curling moments from THAT big showdown press conference.  The President shamelessly called his own words fake news as he denied attacking Theresa May over Brexit. Hours earlier, the President had claimed Mrs May\u0027s new soft Brexit plan would kill a US-UK trade deal in an on-the-record, taped interview. He told the Sun newspaper: The deal she is striking is a much \u0026shydifferent deal than the one the people voted on. Confronted in the press conference, however, Mr Trump said the story was generally fine - but claimed it missed out his positive comments. It\u0027s called fake news and we solve a lot of problems with the good old recording instrument, the President added. Once the Brexit process is concluded and perhaps the UK has left the EU, I don\u0027t know what they’re going to do but whatever you do is okay with me - that’s your decision. Whatever you’re going to do is okay with us. Just make sure we can trade together, that’s all that matters.  After humiliating her with his interview, Donald Trump was VERY keen to make amends. The President oozed praise, saying Theresa May is a terrific and incredible woman and his UK relationship is the highest level of special. He added he had breakfast, lunch and dinner with the PM - and they got on so handsomely I was very embarrassed for the rest of the table. Gesturing at her, he crooned: I also said this incredible woman right here is doing a great job, a fantastic job. He added: She will do very well. I think she’s a very tough negotiator. A lot of people are looking up now saying gee whizz, you know, she left a lot of people in her wake. 3. When he lied about Brexit AGAIN  I you remember I was opening Turnberry [his golf resort] the day before Brexit, we had an unbelievably large number of reporters there, he said. They all showed up on the ninth hole overlooking the ocean and I said what\u0027s going on. I think you will agree I said Brexit will happen, and it did happen, and then we cut the ribbon. This is a lie. Donald Trump went to Turnberry the day after the Brexit vote, not the day before. He told this lie in his Sun interview too.  Trump twice said Boris Johnson - who quit as Foreign Secretary this week in a blaze of publicity - would be great at Theresa May\u0027s job. The Prime Minister looked on with vague sadness as the President stood by his remarks - and dug himself even deeper into a hole. Trump said he was asked specifically about Boris and whether he would be a good PM, and I said he’ll be a great Prime Minister. He’s been very nice to me, he’s been saying very good things about me as president. I think he thinks I’m doing a great job, I am doing a great job, that I can tell you, just in case you haven’t noticed.  We know they are celebrating the special relationship. But Theresa May and Donald Trump are taking their close partnership a little too literally. As they walked to the podium for their joint press conference the President and Prime Minister held each other\u0027s hands. Whether it is truly a sign of their close diplomatic bond, or because the 72-year-old president needed a helping hand, it\u0027s becoming something of a habit. The Donald grabbed onto Theresa May\u0027s hand as he climbed up the stairs of Blenheim Palace for a black tie dinner in his honour last night. And they famously held hands in the colonnade of the White House 18 months ago. 6. When he admitted he hadn\u0027t read up about Brexit  I read reports, the President admitted, that claimed a US trade deal wouldn\u0027t be possible under Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan. But I believe after speaking with the Prime Minister’s people and representatives and trade experts it will absolutely be possible. In other words, he hadn\u0027t done his homework - and Downing Street managed to change his mind. 7. But had this perfect description of it anyway  That Brexit is a very tough situation, the leader of the free world said, poetically. That’s a tough deal between the borders and the entries into the countries and all of the things.  The mop-haired President apologised for his Sun interview - but he was a lot more revealing than Theresa May would like. When I saw her this morning, I said \u0027I want to apologise, because I said such good things about you\u0027, he lamented. She said \u0027Don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s only the press\u0027. 9. But wouldn\u0027t reveal his \u0027brutal\u0027 secret Brexit advice  Trump kept awkwardly referring to a secret suggestion he\u0027d given Theresa May about how to negotiate Brexit. I did give her a suggestion, I wouldn’t say advice, and I think she found it maybe too brutal, the President said. Turning to Mrs May, he added: I don’t know if you remember what I said. We were none the wiser, but Trump brought it up again - and even insisted Mrs May might have to follow his advice one day. Maybe someday she’ll do that, he said mysteriously. If they don’t make the right deal she might very well do what I suggested she might want to do. 10. Apart from saying she CAN\u0027T have No Deal  Trump crashed out of his love affair with Tory Brexiteers by saying Britain CAN\u0027T have a No Deal Brexit. You can’t walk away, because if she walks away that means she’s stuck, the President casually remarked. You can’t walk away, but you can do other things. She can do what my suggestion was. My suggestion was respectfully submitted.  I think it\u0027s changing the culture, it\u0027s a very negative thing for Europe, the right-wing billionaire Republican declared. I know it\u0027s politically not necessarily correct to say that, but I\u0027ll say it loud. He linked it to terror attacks and security and called it a very sad situation, adding: We have laws that are so bad we don\u0027t even call them laws. Delicately contradicting the President, Theresa May said the UK has a proud history of welcoming people who are fleeing persecution to our country She added: Over the years, overall immigration has been good for the UK.  In his rant about immigration, Trump said: I have a great relationship with Angela Merkel, great relationship with Germany, but I think it\u0027s very much hurt Germany. He added: I think they\u0027d better watch themselves. Because you are changing culture, you are changing a lot of things. He also slammed Germany for relying on Russian energy imports, adding: It is a tragedy. I think it is a horrific thing that\u0027s being done when you\u0027re feeding billions and billions of dollars from Germany primarily ... into the coffers of Russia. I think it\u0027s a horrible thing that Germany\u0027s doing. It\u0027s a horrible mistake.

The president and First Lady Melania Trump\u0027s helicopter touched down at Blenheim Palace to a lavish welcome ceremony, which included a marching band and red carpet. The PM wore a long sleeveless red dress and many people spotted a white circle patch on her arm. The device is a diabetic monitoring patch, which is only available on the NHS in certain areas subject to local approval.  It involves a tiny needle under the skin which tracks blood sugar levels and sends the results to a phone or smartwatch.  The clever little piece, which is about the size of a \u0026pound2 coin, constantly monitors glucose levels meaning people with the condition don\u0027t have to keep pricking their finger to check. Created by Abbott, the FreeStyle Libre constantly measures a patient\u0027s blood glucose levels.  It allows patients to see if their blood glucose is going up or down, how blood glucose level changes over time and the past eight hours so you they can see what happens to your blood glucose when you sleep at night. The flash system is made up of a sensor you stick to your arm and a reader which is a small device you use to scan the sensor to see your blood glucose levels. There is also an app available which patients can use to scan the sensor, which usually last for two weeks.  On May\u0027s other arm you can see a mark which looks like she was wearing one there previously, and there\u0027s a similar mark just above.  The device is available on the NHS but only in certain areas and subject to local approval. The NHS advises anyone thinking of buying the system to consult with their diabetes team.  A starter packs costs approximately \u0026pound150 which includes a reader and two sensors.  After that, a sensor and a reader cost \u0026pound50 each.  The new technology was introduced back in 2016. Mrs May has been spotted wearing the patches on several different occasions.

Drew Povey and three other members of staff were suspended from Harrop Fold High School in Salford on Thursday after an internal investigation which has already lasted for several months. Tonight Mr Povey vowed to clear his name telling the Manchester Evening News: “I can confirm I am suspended.  It is completely and utterly unfair. I will clear my name and the name of the school. I’m speaking to my legal team.” Drew, 40, appeared to show commendable leadership qualities, humour, and support and passion for his pupils and staff in the hit series.  However, the M.E.N understands the manner in which the school was being managed is now under investigation. Mr Povey was the star of the programme, which was a fly-on-the-wall documentary about his school. He tweeted on Thursday: “Pressure is something we all have to encounter. Face it head on, do not allow it to phase you, keep strong, do the right thing and keep on going. Forwards not backwards is your destination. #HandlePressure #BeSuccessful.” Councillor Lisa Stone, lead member for children’s and young people’s services at Salford Council, confirmed members of staff have been suspended and said: “The matter is being dealt with according to the school and council’s procedures. “We cannot comment further but the council is supporting the school to provide stability until the end of the academic year. Our priority is the students and we will support the school to make sure their educational needs are met so they can achieve the best possible outcomes.”  Speaking after the TV show aired Drew - who has been at the school for 12 years and headteacher for eight - told the M.E.N he was pleased that Harrop Fold and Little Hulton were finally getting the recognition they deserve. He said: “The kids are absolutely brilliant and they and the school are getting lots of positive press which is exactly what is deserved. “It’s great getting all the exposure and people are really seeing the Salford spirit. That’s one of the reasons we decided to do this. “The impression people have of Salford, it’s all so heavily misaligned and the focus is always on gangs and guns.” “A big part of our decision making process was that we can now shine a spotlight on everything that’s brilliant and show people what an amazing place it is. “Everywhere has its issues but I love the place and I’m fiercely protective over the school, Little Hulton and Salford and I’m extremely proud of the kids and the staff.” He won praise for his handling of tragedy which touched the school. He vowed the spirit of Salford ‘cannot and will not be crushed’ after three children were killed in the Walkden arson attack.  Drew, from Warrington, spoke after being told one his pupils, Demi Pearson, 14, was among the victims. His passion for wanting to improve the life chances of his pupils was a highlight of the popular series. He told the M.E.N at the time of the tragedy: “We are truly devastated by the loss of precious life that our community has suffered.

Scots have years-long history of trolling Donald Trump, with protests currently under way as he visits this weekend during the second half of his four-day UK visit.  But none have yet got the upper hand quite like farmer Michael Forbes - who point-blank refused to sell up when the billionaire businessman came knocking, then got his revenge when Trump exploded with rage. The now-president offered \u0026pound500,000 plus an annual salary for the farmer and his elderly mother to scurry, so he could build an enormous billion-pound golf course and car park on their 23 acres of land - his second in the area. But Michael was having none of it, cementing his title as a local legend and earning him the Glenfiddich Scotsman of the Year 2012 title.  Trump wanted the farmer and fisherman and his elderly mother Molly to give up their home of decades on the Scottish Aberdeenshire coast. After not getting what he wanted he vilified the family, labelling their home disgusting and said Michael lived like a pig, before building an earth wall around his house. Michael\u0027s water supply was mysteriously cut off, leaving 90-year-old Molly to collect water from a stream. But still the farmer didn\u0027t back down, despite threats the Trump Organisation would be seeking compulsory purchase orders on the land and surrounding residents\u0027 property which would force them to sell.  No such orders were filed and the families all remain today - albeit surrounded by the president\u0027s land. Michael did however have to sell off one acre to furious protesters who claimed it an area of outstanding natural beauty. He battled throughout the course being built next door, putting up signs calling Trump a \u0027liar\u0027 and spray-painting \u0027no golf course\u0027 on a farm building. Trump\u0027s contentious battle for the super resort amid the Menie Estate sand dunes - now open - was covered in documentary You\u0027ve Been Trumped. It revealed the vile comments he made about the farmer and how the pair first met when Michael was walking along the beach. Back in 2012, the farmer told The Scotsman: This whole carry-on has been going on for eight years, since I was approached when I was out walking on the beach and asked if I knew about Donald Trump’s golf course.  “I had no idea who he was at that point. I might have kept my mouth shut, but I went right off him the first time I met him. “He was being all nicey, nicey and talking about how successful he was and how much money he had. That was it for me. I took an instant dislike to him.” Michael\u0027s unshakable spirit was recognised in the Glenfiddich Spirit of Scotland Awards, with his citation reading: Michael was resolute in his determination to stand his ground. His story and the unfolding battle attracted international coverage and the recent documentary brought his plight to an even greater \u0026shyaudience. After his win, Michael - who was forced to give up fishing due lack of beach access - said there\u0027s no way he\u0027ll ever sell up to Trump. Ego bruised, Trump demanded a boycott of the whisky brand.  What followed was a mega-trolling as hundreds of Scots posted selfies online toasting Michael with a dram of the good stuff. Despite his connections to the country - Trump\u0027s mother is Scottish-born - the president is relentlessly trolled by residents.  In 2016, stand-up comic Janey Godley famously welcomed him to the country with a sign calling him a c***.  This weekend, thousands of people are expected in Edinburgh for a Carnival of Resistance in the Meadows area of the capital. Campaigners will also gather outside the Trump International Golf Links in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, on Saturday, and it is predicted there could be further demonstrations at Turnberry.  Trump also faced a protest as he arrived at the Turberry golf course when a paraglider - apparently from Greenpeace - circled the grounds with a banner that read Trump Well Below Par.

The duchesses appeared in good spirits as they soaked up the sunshine on the twelve day of the tournament ahead of Serena Williams\u0027 single final match later.  They arrived at the tennis club together for their first joint public appearance without their husbands, before nestling into their Royal Box seats.  But before supporting Williams - a good friend of Meghan\u0027s - the royal pair were treated to a tense \u0027bonus\u0027 semi-final match between Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Play resumed this afternoon after being suspended last night following Kevin Anderson and John Isner\u0027s mammoth six-hour 35-minute battle - the longest in the tournament\u0027s history. As the Duchesses of Cambridge and Sussex walked together from their car to meet some of the Championships\u0027 ball boys and ball girls, and junior players, they exchanged glances and giggles, presumably in excitement for the day ahead.  Kate and Meghan also met former Wimbledon Ladies Champions at a lunch before the final starts and were again pictured smiling together as they made their way to Centre Court. Meghan looked stunning in Ralph Lauren with a pinstriped shirt tucked into flared white trousers, while an equally gorgeous Kate opted for a Jenny Packham dress.     The royal duo could be seen leaning in to talk to one another, giggling and making facial experiences as the knuckle-biting clash continued. And there\u0027ll be more excitement for them this afternoon as former champion Williams fights it out against Germany\u0027s Angelique Kerber in a bid to win an eighth singles title.   The 36-year-old took a front-row seat at Meghan\u0027s wedding to the Duke of Sussex in Windsor in May.  We\u0027ve always had a wonderful friendship, Williams told a post-match press conference. Every year, for a couple years, she comes out to Wimbledon, has supported me. Now she\u0027s supporting me in a different role. But our friendship is still exactly the same. We always have supported each other, just been there for each other through a lot. I look forward to it.

A poll of 2,000 adults found a huge percentage struggle to correctly say the foods we tuck into every day with camembert, chorizo and fajitas also causing confusion. Other commonly mispronounced foods include quesadillas, foie gras and Ni\u0026ccediloise. It also emerged Russia, Mexico and France were deemed to have the hardest-to-pronounce foods, along with Poland, Italy and Spain. A spokesman for French bakery brand Brioche Pasquier, which commissioned the research, said: “Not being 100 per cent sure how to pronounce a word can put people in a tricky situation.  “It’s especially difficult if you’re in a restaurant or somewhere that you can’t get away with saying it wrong. “Our results found people are twice as likely to have a go at pronouncing an unfamiliar food word as admit they don’t know how to pronounce it. “This can lead to further embarrassment as people get more exciting and unusual words wrong, so it’s probably best to just try and laugh it off.” Researchers found nearly a third of the population struggle to say ‘brioche’ correctly. Nearly a tenth of Brits would incorrectly refer to it as ‘bree-ock,’ while a further one in five would pronounce ‘foie gras’ as ‘foy grah’. One in 10 Brits has pronounced the word ‘chipotle’ wrong, and a whopping quarter have come unstuck trying to say ‘quinoa’.

The account thought to belong to Dawn Cranston retweeted Warrington Wolves player Josh Charnley celebrating the fact he was to become a dad. It appears Cranston, jailed yesterday for the manslaughter of her son, even retweeted a post by Wigan Warriors player Sam Tomkins on June 30 2016 - the same day her emaciated son died.  The Twitter activity on the account then promptly stopped, reports Leeds Live .  Jordan, 18, died shortly after paramedics were called to his Farnley home.  He weighed just six stone and was severely malnourished and dehydrated when he was found lying in a soiled nappy, on a dirty inflatable mattress. He was covered in infected pressure sores so severe a bone had become exposed. A post-mortem examination found the teenager had died as a result of bronchopneumonia, caused by malnutrition, immobility and infected pressure sores. Jailing Jordan\u0027s mother, grandmother Denise Cranston and sister Abigail Burling, Judge Mr Justice Spencer said the teenager, who had learning difficulties, must have suffered a lingering, excruciating death. But during Jordan\u0027s final days his mum\u0027s Twitter account — @leedsrhinos123 — continued to retweet posts about her beloved Leeds Rhinos and Leeds United.  The believed account of Dawn Cranston, who was jailed for four years after being found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence, also retweeted posts about children\u0027s TV and boy band Busted. Jordan\u0027s sister Abigail Burling, who was cleared of manslaughter but found guilty of causing or allowing the death of a vulnerable adult, also appears to be a prolific tweeter. Wrestling fan Abigail appears to have tweeted during the days of her trial, which began on June 6, particularly about New Zealand-born wrestler Jay \u0027Switchblade\u0027 White. The account retweeted a post about White, who performs in New Japan Pro-Wrestling, yesterday, the day she was jailed for 18 months.  And on July 8, the account - \u0027Switchblade\u0027s Water Bottle\u0027 - tweeted: Past 2 nights I\u0027ve been having the same flash back and it\u0027s effecting (sic) my anxiety disorder, I feel like deleting everything and leaving. I don\u0027t feel like a fan anymore, I fell (sic) like I was disrespectful cause what happened. Jordan\u0027s grandmother Denise Cranston, 70, was sentenced to three years imprisonment after also being convicted of manslaughter at Leeds Crown Court, on Tuesday. The remains of a baby, \u0027almost certainly\u0027 the son of Dawn Cranston, were found in a rucksack at the family home at Butterbowl Garth.

Spectacular thunderstorms, lashing rain and a mega temperature drop of up to 10 DEGREES are forecast, bringing an abrupt finish to the glorious summer spell that\u0027s gripped the nation for weeks. This weekend will remain hot with highs of 31-2C before the mercury tumbles to closer-to-average levels for this time of year - 18.6C to 22.6C. From Tuesday, vicious thunderstorms and heavy rain are predicted to sweep in. The unsettled conditions will subside and most areas of the UK are expected to be sunny despite temperatures falling. A Met Office spokesman said the south east could hit 31C today, with rain and cloud expected in Scotland and Northern Ireland across the weekend.  Tomorrow could hit highs of 32C before heavy showers begin on Monday.  Eventually it will be fresher weather that wins out, by the time we get on to Tuesday, they said.  Less hot, is the best way to describe next week, but it will still be warm. There will be some sunny spells but there will be a few showers around that could be heavy and thundery. From Wednesday to Friday next week, the Met Office is warning of thunder, wind and rain.    All parts of the UK will see some spells of sunshine, but there is likely to be relatively more in the way of rain or showers at times too, its website says. Some of the showers could be heavy or thundery at times. There may also be bands of more persistent rain on occasion which may bring some stronger winds too, especially to northern and western parts. These bands of rain could occur at any time but become more likely later on in the period.  The best of the fine weather and sunny conditions looks to be in the east and southeast of the UK. Temperatures will be close to average in the northwest, but with light winds it will still feel very warm at times across the south and east.  Yesterday the weather forecaster issued yellow weather warnings for thunderstorms in Greater Manchester and Croydon for the first time in history.  Boroughs in the the East Midlands, East of England, London and South East of England, North West England, South West England, Wales, West Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside were also warned of storms.

The interview will air on Good Morning Britain on ITV on Monday. But the news has not been met with the reaction Piers may have hoped for. I\u0027d rather gouge out my eyes with a melon baller, mate, wrote Daniel Summers, a medicine and health columist. Another said: I look forward to missing it! Thanks for the warning!

The TV host tweeted: I’ve been on a few fancy planes in my time but nothing quite like this one.  Air Force One was held on the tarmac at Stansted Airport for 30 minutes for the conversation between the two. The interview is thought to be an exclusive for ITV and comes less than a day after Trump disparaged May\u0027s Brexit negotiating to The Sun. In that incendiary interview the American commander-in-chief also said Boris Johnson would be a \u0027good Prime Minister\u0027 and blamed London mayor Sadiq Khan for not tackling terrorism in the capital. The US president, alongside his wife Melania, enjoyed afternoon tea with the Queen at Windsor Castle before flying off to Scotland where he will spend two nights.  Before the flight took off Trump took part in an interview with Good Morning Britain presenter. It is widely thought Trump will play golf at one of his courses between now and his flight to Helsinki - to meet with Russian President Putin - on Sunday. Meanwhile organisers claimed 250,000 protesters lined the streets of London to register their disdain for the 45th president. That figure has not been verified. At an explosive press conference at Chequers this afternoon Trump continued to say Brexiteer Boris Johnson would make a good Prime Minister but also backed Theresa May\u0027s leadership.

The three-year-olds were left in the wooden crate with no pillows or toys for comfort, police who made the shocking discovery said. Pictures show the disturbing scene of the boys separated and unable to touch each other inside the tiny box which was locked with a padlock. The disturbing discovery was made by police officers in the town of Aparecidinha in the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo. Police officials told reporters they had received an anonymous tip-off that the two toddlers were locked inside the box and officers then went to the house.  The photo shows how the cops found the two boys locked inside the tiny wooden box which had a padlock and chain on it. The two boys have been taken to a shelter whilst the parents, both farmers, were arrested and taken to a police station on suspicion of infant mistreatment.

However, it wasn’t to be as while he rummaged in his bag to find the ring, he was interrupted by a group of German tourists.With the mood killed, they went to the beach, but after sunbathing for just 10 minutes, Craig said they should go back to the hotel because he was too hot.He chose the balcony of their room which overlooked the lake to ask Aimee to become his wife.Aimee couldn’t even answer and instead simply burst into tears of happiness.After careful planning by the couple, the morning of the wedding arrived and the sun was shining.Aimee said: “When I woke up and saw the sun I was so happy that I was getting my outdoor wedding.“It made the photos taken by Burfly Photography from the day look really green and beautiful.“We had a flower wall created by Celebre which was stunning and it would have been a beautiful backdrop for the ceremony too.”The bride was accompanied down the aisle by stepdad Graham and the ceremony conducted by humanist Neil Anderson was the highlight of the day.“We made sure that the ceremony wasn’t boring and it was very personal,” said Aimee.“Neil was absolutely incredible and delivered our story in a fun way.“The night-time reception was brilliant but the day-time was our highlight.”The pair took to the floor to have their first dance as a married couple to The Verve’s hit song Lucky Man, which was performed by band Paper Tiger.Craig and Aimee would like to thank their wedding planners Katy and Fiona, videographers I Do, bridal shop Annarose and all their family and friends.Aimee added: “I wouldn’t change a thing about my wedding.

That’s what we’ve done and I’ve been impressed by the boys in training and these friendlies,” said the 27-year-old full-back.“Quite a few of the boys who’ve been brought in also have good experience of Scottish football.

There have been days when the phone’s rang over a 100 times but that’s what happens when you make the slight changes we’ve made,” he joked.“It really started right after we lost to Livingston in the play-offs and we’ve been going ever since.“I know the manager is happy with the nine players he’s got so far and there are a few more we’d like and don’t forget the back-room staff have also been reshuffled.”And it’s not just been about identifying talent – making sure players have the right character and are capable of handling the rigours of the second tier has been important, too.“In a lot of ways it’s not finding players with talent that’s the hard part, it’s making sure they are the right type, so there’s been a lot of work checking on backgrounds and how they are away from the pitch.“And when you look to last season, St Mirren and Livingston were successful using two different styles but what they had in common was they were physically strong.“I think at times we were lacking that so we have made sure we’ve got players who can play but also handle the other side of it as well.”Or so he believes, and Luggy accepts proof United have got it right this time will only come via the results.“The proof of the pudding starts with Arbroath. It’s been a very good pre-season and everyone has enjoyed it but now we have to take the hard work on to the park.“Arbroath is a good game to start because I know Dick and Ian Campbell very well and they will come to Tannadice looking for a result.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"popular hub seeking community chest funds to help feed dundees needy","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA voluntary group whose services to the public include running a foodbank is hoping for a share of the cash in our Community Chest.Charleston Community Centre’s foodbank, Food For Thought, is a non-profit, non-funded alternative to traditional foodbanks for which no referral is needed from an outside agency.The centre is run by volunteers and provides other services to members of the public, including running a youth group, an art group and a playgroup.It sees about 85 people a day coming through the door who attend its groups.However, the centre relies on fundraising to bring money in.Vice-chairwoman of the management group, Samantha Bruce, says the whole community is excited to be taking part in the competition which has been running for nearly two weeks.Groups need to collect at least 50 of the tokens printed daily in the Tele for a chance to share of £10,000.She said: “We have got the whole community involved. We’ve got people from school collecting, and everyone that is involved with all the groups. We are just glad that there is something out there that we can use to get funding in the pot.“I think it’s a really good thing. Everyone has come on board with it.”She said any money received would be split among the groups. “If we got the money from the Community Chest it would go in the pot and that would give food to more people,” she said.Food For Thought receives no funding but charges users £1.50 and they can take as much food as they need.Samantha added: “If the money wasn’t there then we would not be able to provide the service.”Chairwoman Wendy Higgins said if the initiative won a lot of money it would ask the groups to come up with ideas on what they want it to be spent on.She added: “We do know that the youth group, and the children’s art group and the cheeky monkey group will definitely benefit.”Don’t miss out on your chance to enter your community group into our competition.Visit www.thetele/promotions and remember to keep an eye out for bonus tokens in today\u0026#8217 paper.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"randy wolters leaves dundee to join nec on two year deal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWinger Randy Wolters has left Dundee to join Dutch side NEC.The 28-year-old still had another year on his deal at Dens Park but the two parties have come to a mutual agreement meaning Wolters could leave for pastures new.He has now penned a two-year deal with Dutch second tier side NEC (Nijmegen Eendracht Combinatie).Wolters previously told of his struggles with homesickness having played all of his career in the Netherlands before joining Dundee last summer.He made 16 appearances for the Dark Blues.Before the move in a press conference today, McCann said: “Randy moving on is a possibility.\u0026#8220He’s very frustrated he didn’t feature more.

An employment tribunal awarded him more than £10,000.But now Mr Brown, who runs events and production company The Longest Forty, is taking the club and American director Mr Nelms to a tribunal again – this time citing post-employment victimisation and harassment.The action stems from a dispute over a Legends of the Ball – Champions 2013/2014 event which was due to take place at the Doubletree by Hilton on the outskirts of the city in February.It is understood that Mr Brown alleges that Dens Park chief Mr Nelms contacted Hilton boss Richard Ellison and forced him to cancel the event – leading to a breach of contract – and said he was unhappy someone who was successful in a claim against the club was working alongside the hotel.He also alleges Mr Nelms prevented current Dundee players Craig Wighton and Cammy Kerr from attending the event, despite them having already agreed to do so and having been advertised as appearing.The event was cancelled and Mr Brown alleges this was due to his previous case against Dundee.He now wants damages and alleges that Mr Nelms’ actions were maliciously motivated.It is understood both the club amd Mr Nelms dispute Mr Brown’s claims and insist he did not intervene and that official permission was never sought for players to attend the event.Dundee FC and representatives for Mr Nelms declined to comment.Solicitor Ryan Russell, of Muir Myles and Laverty, confirmed he had been instructed to pursue a claim on Mr Brown’s behalf.He said: “Due to the ongoing legal proceedings, it would inappropriate to comment at this stage on the specifics or merits of the claim.

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Saturday 14 Jul 2018 3:34 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/03971000/03971780.jpg","title":"New air control system to be based at Inverness","story":"\u0026nbspThe board has also committed to undertaking a communities impact assessment as part of it Air Traffic Management 2030 project which will run all activities covering seven Scottish airports \u0026ndash Sumburgh, Dundee, Inverness, Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats, Kirkwall, Stornoway and Benbecula \u0026ndash from one centralised tower and surveillance centre.Hial managing director Inglis Lyon said: \"The scoping study identifies Inverness as having the most compelling case to support Hial\u0027 continued delivery of its core activities.\"We have also taken the views of our staff into account and Inverness was their preferred option should relocation be required.\"Inverness is best suited from a technical, operational and staffing perspective.

A friendly at Inverness Caley Thistle on Wednesday had to be called off due to injury problems.Summer signing Stephen Gleeson (knee), Niall McGinn (thigh), Mikey Devlin (groin) and Frank Ross (groin) are injured.The Reds are still awaiting the full results of a scan which will reveal the extent of Gleeson’s injury.He will miss tomorrow’s friendly with Cove Rangers, but the Dons are still hopeful he could feature against Burnley in the Europa League second qualifying round, the first leg of which is on July 26.Another summer signing, Chris Forrester (groin), and Sam Cosgrove (calf) were also injured but are expected to be fit to face Cove tomorrow.So far this summer the Dons have only signed three players with £200,000 outlaid for the capture of Forrester from Peterborough United.Republic of Ireland international Gleeson was secured on a free. An SPFL tribunal will decide the training compensation due for teenager Lewis Ferguson who signed from Hamilton.Polish defender Krystian Nowak is currently training with the Dons and is set to feature as a trialist in tomorrow’s friendly.The 24-year-old is a free agent having had his contract with Greek side Panionios terminated earlier this summer.Aberdeen also had a bid for Doncaster striker John Marquis, understood to be for £250,000, rejected.Boss Derek McInnes confirmed that bid was the highest the Reds could go to and they will now look at other potential targets for centre-forward.Celtic and Rangers have both invested heavily in their squads this season.But Considine insists the heavy spending of the Old Firm will only inspire Aberdeen.He said: “Celtic always generate so much money through their transfers and whatever.“You expect it from them.“Due to the situation with Rangers they haven’t been able to do that, but this year they have. It is great to see and is healthy for Scottish football.“A strong Rangers is good for the league.“It also brings us on.“In the past few years or so we have still remained second so regardless of what they are going to spend we are still going to challenge this season again.”Aberdeen’s preparations for the Euro tie with Burnley conclude with a friendly against West Brom at Pittodrie on Friday.The Baggies were relegated to the Championship at the end of last season.Considine said: ”When we play West Brom here that will be a good indication of what is coming.“Although they were obviously relegated, in my eyes they are still a Premier League team.“That will be a good test for us and will show where we are at and what is coming opposition wise.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen airport boss stepping down from role after 10 years","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe managing director of Aberdeen airport is stepping down from her role after 10 years.Carol Benzie joined Aberdeen International Airport (AIA) in 2008, and carried out a series of senior roles including operations director and commercial director, before being appointed managing director in October 2013.During her decade at AIA, Carol has overseen the expansion of the airport’s route network as well as the single largest investment in its history.AIA, owned by AGS Airports Limited, is currently undergoing a multi-million-pound redevelopment project – phase two of which was completed last month.

cataloguing the MacDonald maps and plans collection, which dates to the late 1800s.It comes as work has begun on the new £50 million stadium at Kingsford, which will include a 20,000-seat stadium.Although the new stadium will be capable of seating up to 20,000 fans, the original plans – which date back to 1899 – show engineering drawings for Pittodrie Park.The designs were produced by Beattie \u0026amp Macdonald, C.E., Surveyors and Architects, which had offices on Bridge Street in the city centre.The Merkland Road venue first boasted a 1,000-capacity stand and was established on the site of a dunghill for police horses.The first game was held against Dumbarton on September 2 1899.In 1903 Pittodrie became the new home of Aberdeen Football Club, following the amalgamation of the previous club, Orion, and Victoria United.It then joined the Scottish Second Division in 1904.Paul Logie, museums and special collections archives assistant at Aberdeen University, said: “The MacDonald maps and plans collection is a wonderful resource for studying the development of the city and shire from the late 18th Century to the early 20th Century and includes many rare and unique maps by prominent north-east surveyors of the time.“The collection, part of the university’s Special Collections, highlights the introduction of public housing, transport routes and water supply and drainage schemes and demonstrates how the north-east landscape and its villages and towns were shaped over time.”The unique collection of maps and plans was transferred to the university’s Special Collections Centre in the Sir Duncan Rice Library in 2012.It includes around 5,500 plans relating to both Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.The earliest map dates back to 1746 with the latest, more recent, being drawn in 1955.As it stands, today’s Pittodrie Stadium has come a long way from the plans drawn up in 1899.It currently has a seating capacity of 20,961 – a sizeable difference from its original 1,000.The most extensive development came in 1993 when the stand on the east side of the ground was demolished and the Richard Donald Stand constructed in its place.Since then the ground has remained mostly unchanged.A spokesman for Aberdeen Football Club said: “It’s great to see what the place looked like before Aberdeen Football Club took possession.“That is something that will be of interest in the future.“We will have a museum in the new stadium and we will be wanting to show Pittodrie as it looked before.”The first phase of construction of the new stadium at Kingsford will include a training pavilion, groundsmen’s accommodation, three professional training pitches, two 3G pitches and two grass pitches, which will be shared between the club and Aberdeen Football Club Community Trust (AFCCT).Earthworks have started which will allow the formal construction work to begin on the stadium in October.It is expected that the facilities – valued at £10 million – will be completed by summer next year, with work beginning on the stadium itself after phase one has been finished.All of the records have been processed online and can be viewed on the university’s

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

All four girls contributed valuable points, with Jemma excelling in the 75 metres sprint recording a time of 12.65 seconds. Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The biggest cheer of the day was reserved for this year’s Queen Chloe Macdonald, who together with her Princesses Caitlyn Prentice and Cara Mackie were introduced to the crowd by Rev Robert Macleod and Councillor Anne Horn.Tarbert’s new Royal Family then led the famous festival parade where locals and visitors alike dressed up and joined in with this year’s Heroes and Villains theme.  Pirates and superheroes watched on as Cruella De Vil and her dogcatcher tried to capture more Dalmatian puppies. And the Batmobile was hot on the trail of the Joker who was seen heading through the village with Poison Ivy.One of the festival’s most eagerly anticipated events is the cookery demonstrations, once again led by Mike Leslie of Kilsyth’s Coachman Hotel. The market area was packed as cooks got some professional tips on how to prepare and cook seafood.While the adults tucked into some of Tarbert’s finest fish and shellfish, younger festival-goers were being wowed by the gravity defying Clan Stunt Bike Team, before learning new skills in the circus workshop.Highland dancing displays plus performances by festival regulars Mid Argyll Pipe Band ensured there was something for everyone, before Sunday’s Beer on the Pier, where party people of all ages packed Tarbert’s quay, ready to be entertained.Girl band Feeva promised and delivered ‘cheesy tunes’ and were closely followed by Scotland’s number one Take That cover band, Could It Be Take That, to keep the party atmosphere going. Local band The Democrats brought the curtain down on this year’s festival in style.With just three people in the festival committee it fell to organiser Margaret MacNeill to comment on this year’s event saying: \u0026#8216Thank you to everyone who came and joined in with this year\u0026#8217s Seafood Festival.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole. Councillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy. Plans will see Cairn and Gardenrose Primaries merge to become a new school located at the purpose-built campus. Nurseries for both schools would also merge to be ready for August 2021. St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school. A bid for funding will now be made to the Scottish Government.

Council schools spokesman William Grant said: “There is a general agreement of all schools to come together. “Where we had a more mixed response regarded the possible move of the swimming pool. “It is important as we progress the design that too much is not crammed in to this new campus. “It must be open and spacious.” Maybole Tory councillor Ian Campbell hailed the project as a “wonderful step forward”.

Nicola, 28-year-old classical singer married 30-year-old shipbuilding engineer John Hunter. The pair now live in Shawlands, Glasgow, but were both originally from Ayr. One Friday night back in 2009 John walked in to Harley’s Pub in Ayr to wish his cousin a happy birthday, and his sister told him to say hello to Nicola – her workmate at the time. “Nobody knows if it was the brown eyes, the sweet perfume or the six pints, three vodkas and the shot of Midori that caused him to steal my cardigan but steal it he did,” joked Nicola. She added: “A few days later, cardigan in hand, John returned it to H Samuel where I worked at the time. And that moment was the beginning of something special.” Since then both have enjoyed years of happiness and in October 2016 – seven years after meeting – John asked Nicola to marry him at Loch Lomond.  John and Nicola tied the knot on Thursday, June 7, at The Cruin at Loch Lomond. The couple said: “It was relaxing, elegant and absolutely perfect. “We can’t thank the staff enough. The weather, setting and scenery were breath-taking.” The bride wore a Vera Wang dress from David’s Bridal, Braehead, the bridesmaids also wearing gowns from David’s Bridal. The kilts were the Spirit of Lochearn tartan from Kilts 4 U. The wedding party consisted of Best man Mark Cosgrove, Groomsmen Niall Carney, Paddy McCurdie and Ryan Glass (nephew, aged 8), Maid of honour sister Jennifer Cassells, Bridesmaids Laura Dickson, Heather Armstrong and Aimee Trainer, Groom’s parents John Hunter and Hazel Hunter and the Bride’s parents Brian Cassells and Julie Cassells. The pair are currently celebrating being newlyweds in Bangkok, Thailand, and will be heading to Koh Samui, Thailand, then on to the Atlantis in Dubai.  3D Cakes created the couples wedding cake. The couple said: “We were inspired by the Scottish theme and used the same tartan ribbon that was on the kilts.” Kev Moulds Photography captured Nicola and John’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. The bouquets were arranged by Narcissus Flowers by Susan Hair and make-up was styled and created by Anna Wade (hair) and Lynn Brown (make-up). The couple added: “We would like to thank everyone who made the day possible, especially our parents Brian Cassells, Julie Cassells, John Hunter and Hazel Hunter. “And to our guests who contributed to an amazing day.” For more photos of the couple\u0027s big day, pick up your copy of this week\u0027s Ayrshire Post.

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit.

Andrew Power, club captain of Royal Troon, said: “We chose to donate to the Acute Stroke Unit as three of our members were in this unit over the last year and are all now recovering well. The word from them is that they got the best of care and were delighted we chose to donate to the unit” During the event, Stroke and TIA (Transient Ischaemic Attack) information packs were handed out, making it a great opportunity to spread awareness of how to act when someone is suffering from a stroke.  Andrew added: “We had a great day, great weather and we were glad we made a good amount for a good cause. We’d like to say from all at Royal Troon that you (staff at Ward 3E) do a great job and hope this cheque can help out in any way it can”. Senior charge nurse, Christine Sommerville, said: “Patients are admitted from all over Ayrshire to the ASU. Stroke happens with no warning, but with specialised care and input, outcomes are improved. “We are delighted to hear the members are recovering well and that they had a positive experience in the ASU. “On behalf of the ASU team, a big thank you.

That’s the shock ultimatum delivered by warring SNP councillors to their embattled leader. Douglas Campbell has been ordered to regain control of his split ranks during the council’s summer break. It comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track. A racism storm and failed coup on Councillor Campbell has plunged the SNP into crisis. And the Post understands another plot to oust the leader is now brewing. It follows all SNP group members signing a declaration of support for their under-fire boss just two weeks ago. But a party insider has revealed growing disquiet is threatening to tear the group apart.  Within hours of the public show of support, Cllr Campbell was being placed under increasing pressure to step down of his own accord, rather than face another bruising challenge from within, the Post has learned. A senior source said: “People agreed to fall in line and sign the declaration for the sake of the bigger picture. “But it’s widely accepted that a change is required and this can’t go on. “The group is in a position where people will fight like rats to get what they want. “However, the even bigger concern is trying to keep the administration intact.” Worries over a potential walkout from Labour colleagues has, until now, ensured enough SNP support behind Cllr Campbell. A potential change in the their leadership is thought that have strained relations with administration partners, who have indicated they are happier working with Cllr Campbell.  But the Post understands that Cllr Campbell’s Labour past is forming a big part of the problem for the SNP leader as he battles factions within his new party. And a new warning – issued as councillors left for their summer break – stressed that he must crack the whip among his troubled ranks. The source added: “It was made very clear that if he doesn’t, the matter will be taken out of his hands. “The party is being crucified every week and it cannot be allowed to continue. “Some see Douglas as being far too close to Labour and that is undoubtedly a big issue for him. “Either way, he’s been given the message in clear terms that he needs to get everyone behind him and on the same page.” When asked about the warning, the group’s depute leader, William Grant, insisted: “This is news to me.” Cllr Campbell added: “Cllr Grant responded to your enquiry that ‘This is news to me’ and I have nothing to add.” "},{"url":null,"title":"travel-a68-cleared-after-lorry-sheds-load-of-hay-on-road","story":"THE A68 has reopened to traffic after a lorry shed a load of hay on the road this afternoon.\nThe accident covered\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspA68 in both directions at the A697, near Carfraemill at around 1.10pm.\nA cleanup operation swiftly launched to remove the hay from the road.\nTraffic Scotland\u0026nbspconfirmed at\u0026nbsp3.10pm today (Thursday, July 5) that the hay has since\u0026nbspbeen cleared off the carriageway.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch-see-inside-abandoned-galashiels-church","story":"A YOUTUBE video highlighting safety fears over an abandoned historic church in Galashiels is creating an online storm.\nThe video, filmed within the last fortnight, shows Galashiels resident Ian Macey jumping onto a flat roof and entering the 138-year-old St Aidan\u0026rsquos Church in Gala Park Road through an open window.\nIan highlights a lack of security at the building \u0026ndash which contains precious war memorials \u0026ndash vandalism, rotting floorboards and exposes its hidden health hazards such as asbestos.\nThe scenes have drawn criticism from some of the hundreds who have viewed the footage.\nIan told the \nBorder \n: \u0026ldquoThis is the second time I\u0026rsquove had a look around the church, after entering it earlier in the year.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.  Twenty-year-old Emily\u0026rsquos involvement in the project is the latest step as she attempts to land her dream job.

A post from the youth project said: \u0026ldquoOver the past three years, young people have been looking at youth provision in North Berwick and have been shocked to learn just how much has been lost and never replaced.  \u0026ldquoThe team have been working hard to receive advice from East Lothian Council on what can be put in place to ensure a safe environment for all, as well as actions which can be taken to discourage anti-social behaviour. The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.  Mr Paul, who is chairman of Glasclune Residents Association, said: \u0026ldquoWe feel that it is the wrong site for this.  \u0026ldquoWe are open to the accusation that it\u0026rsquos because it is at the back of our house and that\u0026rsquos partly fair \u0026ndash ideally we\u0026rsquod like to see the shelter pulled down.  \u0026ldquoBut rather than just saying it\u0026rsquos not right, we\u0026rsquove offered to the youth project to fundraise for an alternative.  \u0026ldquoThere are a lot of people who live here who have experience of managing projects.

Lauren Cowie, project manager at North Berwick Youth Project, insisted plans were \u0026ldquostill at a very early stage.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe are committed to working with the entire community and in particular those who live near the proposed shelter.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance.

Details of what happened have not been released publicly, although the Courier understands that it followed a private function on the premises the previous evening.  In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.  The board agreed to transfer the licence to Mr Hughes, wishing him luck with the venture."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-open-2018-trophy-tour-finale-at-tranent-school","story":"  Beth Allen, ambassador for ASI and member of the Ladies European and LPGA Tour, was there on the day and attended a special assembly and Q\u0026ampA session with pupils to give more insight into her life as a professional golfer.

A ClubGolf mass participation session was then held over lunchtime to give all children at the school a chance to experience golf, using everything from plastic ClubGolf equipment, professional clubs and golf balls to Scottish Golf inflatable nets.  About 14,000 primary and high school pupils in East Lothian have been visited at their schools as part of the trophies tour in the run-up to the Scottish Open, which takes place from next Thursday (July 12), and the Ladies\u0026rsquo Scottish Open which begins on Thursday, July 26.  Mr Martin said: \u0026ldquoThe trophies tour finale at Sanderson\u0026rsquos Wynd was an amazing day and these children not only got to see the trophies up close but also got to grill a brilliant professional athlete in Beth Allen. It was also fantastic to give them the opportunity to swing a golf club for the first time.  \u0026ldquoI hope that the trophy tour has inspired children across East Lothian to come down to Gullane in July and continue to get involved in golf.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.

Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.

The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.  As well as his time with MacBrayne, the book looks at Kit\u0026rsquos dad\u0026rsquos time in the Armed Forces, as well as becoming a sub-postmaster in Aviemore as the town evolved from a \u0026ldquosleepy former railway junction into its present skiing and outdoor pursuits centre.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier.

The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done.

It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

A former Musselburgh Grammar School pupil and member of Edinburgh Road Club (RC) Cycling Club, he won the British youth circuit race championship in 2013 at Blackpool.  Ben, who passed away on July 1, was studying geography at the University of Edinburgh.  Christopher Noble, Ben\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoheartbroken flat-mate, paid tribute to his friend on Facebook.

A tribute on the Edinburgh RC website stated: \u0026ldquoEdinburgh RC would like to mark the life of former club member Ben Forsyth which sadly ended on July 1.  \u0026ldquoHe was a stalwart member of the youth section until he joined the Spokes race team in 2014.  \u0026ldquoThe pinnacle of his cycling achievements was winning the British youth circuit race championship in 2013 on the promenade at Blackpool in an ERC jersey.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

Memphis, the first capital of ancient Egypt, and its large necropolis are home to a wide range of temples and tombs as well as the three pyramids of Giza.  The latest find, announced at a press conference, belongs to the Saite-Persian Period, from 664-404 BC. The site, which lies south of Unas pyramid, was last excavated more than 100 years ago, in 1900.  Among the artefacts found were a gilded silver mummy mask, fragments of mummy cartonnages, canopic cylindrical jars and marl clay and faience cups.  Many of them will be displayed in the under-construction Grand Egyptian Museum, the first phase of which is expected to be inaugurated later this year.  Down the 30-metre-deep shaft lie several mummies, wooden coffins and sarcophagi. The shaft is comprised of burial chambers carved into the bedrock lining the sides of two hallways.  In the mummification workshop, an embalmer\u0026rsquos cachette was found that archaeologists believe will reveal more about the oils used in the mummification process in the 26th Dynasty.  \u0026ldquoWe are in front of a goldmine of information about the chemical composition of these oils, Archaeologist Ramadan Hussein said at the press conference.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos only the beginning, added Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani.

Also, the Government\u0026rsquos proposed customs solution \u0026ndash the facilitated customs arrangement - will have a \"phased\" implementation Whitehall sources have suggested this will not be completed until mid-2022, two years after the end of the transition period.  Jacob Rees-Mogg, who leads the 60-strong group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, unleashed a fierce attack on the Government paper, saying: \"The overall consequence is that we will be a rule-taker, de-facto subject to the European Court of Justice and it\u0027s hard to believe that there is even a tinge of pink left in Mrs May\u0027s red line on this.  Suggesting the PM had broken her promises given in her earlier keynote speeches, he declared: \u0026ldquoWe have not known such vassalage to the continent since King John paid homage to the King of France in 1200.  The Somerset MP insisted his party leader\u0026rsquos policy on immigration meant nothing as it kept open the \u0026ldquooption of free movement by another name and added: \u0026ldquoThis White Paper has not needed age to turn yellow.  In a Commons statement, Dominic Raab, the new Brexit Secretary, said the paper set out a vision for \"a bold, ambitious and innovative new partnership with the EU, principled and practical, faithful to the referendum it delivers a deal that is good for the UK and good for our EU friends.  The Government, he explained, wanted to maintain parts of a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook for goods to maintain \"frictionless trade at the border\" after Brexit and so avoid a hard Irish border.  While the European Court will shape the trade rules, Mr Raab sought to reassure MPs, saying control of laws would be taken back by means of a \u0026ldquoparliamentary lock on the process and that MPs would have \u0026ldquoproper democratic oversight.  A new governing body would police the new institutional arrangements through which, the paper said, the UK Government \"will represent the interests of all parts of the UK in this forum, ensuring the interests of the devolved administrations are taken into account.  But Fiona Hyslop for the Scottish Government said the paper offered \u0026ldquolittle reassurance for those worried about the impact that leaving the EU will have on our economy quite simply, these plans fall short and will harm our economy.  The SNP administration\u0026rsquos External Affairs Secretary said it would \u0026ldquoargue for much greater engagement with the UK Government to ensure Scotland\u0027s interests are protected\".  In the Commons chamber, Mr Raab\u0026rsquos first appearance at the dispatch box in his new role descended into chaotic scenes as Labour MPs erupted in uproar, shouting \u0026ldquodisgrace, because they had not had prior sight of the paper when the Secretary of State rose to his feet.  To make the MPs\u0026rsquo sense of outrage worse, it was pointed out how journalists had been briefed by Whitehall officials and had had sight of the policy document before parliamentarians got to see it.  Such was the tumult on the green benches that John Bercow, the Speaker, had to suspend the sitting until MPs were able to get copies, which were handed out by their colleagues from boxes obtained from Westminster officials.  Labour\u0026rsquos Sir Keir Starmer, denounced the Government\u0026rsquos handling of the launch, telling MPs: \"The utter shambles of the last 20 minutes that led to the suspension of the House during a statement is clear evidence of why the Government is in such a mess.\"  The SNP\u0026rsquos Pete Wishart said the incident summed up the \u0026ldquowhole chaotic and clueless Brexit as prosecuted by this shambles of a Government.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe White Paper was supposed to deliver Cabinet unity, but all it has done, as we have seen, is demonstrate the divisions. Scotland did not vote for any of this, so can the Secretary of State perhaps suggest a way that Scotland might be spared this madness?  Mr Raab, to Conservative cheers, replied: \u0026ldquoWe voted in the referendum as one country and we need to respect it as one country.  Earlier, Donald Trump, who is in Britain for, among other things, a working lunch with Mrs May, when they will discuss Brexit, appeared to question the PM\u0026rsquos Brexit strategy.

In a robust response to last weekend\u0026rsquos incident in which a Catholic priest was spat at, abused and lunged at by a baton-wielding man, she warned the city has now reached \u0026ldquotipping point in relation to anti-social behaviour linked to Orange parades.  She called for Orange Lodge leaders to voluntarily agree to reroute planned marches in the area of the east end church at the centre of the incident and avoid what she described as \u0026ldquoa local potential flashpoint.  If they failed, she said the city council would insist on a change of route and warned it is prepared to \u0026ldquostrength-test existing laws and our own codes of conduct in relation to preventing horrendous incidents like the attack on Canon Tom White.  Three Orange Order parades are currently scheduled to take place later this month and in August in the area around Saturday\u0026rsquos sectarian attack.  However, any move to re-route parades is expected to be met with strong resistance from the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland, which is fiercely protective of its members\u0026rsquo rights to march along traditional routes.  The Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland has not responded to The Herald\u0026rsquos request for comment on the latest development. A member of staff at its Glasgow office said the organisation does not speak to The Herald.  Police are still investigating last Saturday\u0026rsquos incident in which Canon White was targeted while he chatted with parishioners outside St Alphonsus\u0026rsquo Church in the east end. The Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland, Jim McHarg later condemned the \u0026ldquobigoted actions of what he described as a small number of people who had turned up to watch 4500 marchers take part in the County Grand Orange Order Boyne Parade.  However, writing in today\u0026rsquos Agenda section of The Herald, the council leader said the Orange Lodge had to take responsibility. She said: \u0026ldquoOfficial participants may not be involved in sectarian and anti-social incidents around parades but it\u0026rsquos simply not enough to absolve themselves by pointing to hangers-on.  \u0026ldquoThey need to step up and take wider responsibility for those they attract and refer to as their wider support and networks when it suits. What happens on your watch happens on your watch.  The incident sparked public outrage and a 75,000 name petition calling for a blanket ban on Orange parades. However, Cllr Aitken stressed that European human rights legislation and Scottish legislation means the council does not have powers to enact a blanket ban. She has now called for MSPs to consider how they can strengthen existing legislation to support councils.  In a series of tweets yesterday, she added that the council is liaising with Police Scotland to find grounds on which future parades may be curbed and that local authority officials have been primed to ensure all the council\u0026rsquos powers are used \u0026ldquoto their fullest extent.  She added that moves are underway to make it easier for members of the public to object to parades and marches via the council website and My Glasgow app.  A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoResponsibility for the regulation of marches and parades rests with local authorities. Each local authority, in consultation with Police Scotland, is in the best position to decide whether a particular event should go ahead and whether any restrictions should be placed on it.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government supports local authorities in making decisions which achieve the correct balance between the rights of marchers and the rights of the communities affected.\"  A spokesman for the Catholic Church said: \u0026ldquoClearly, Glasgow City Council are constrained in the steps they can take to curtail parades by legislation passed by the Scottish Parliament. It is however reassuring to note that they will act firmly where they can. Hopefully Police Scotland will support action to control the routing and timing of parades in the light of the recent hateful and unprovoked attack."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8067721.jpg?type=article-full","title":"revealed-turkish-oligarch-is-secret-owner-of-major-aberdeen-shopping-centres","story":"  Billionaire Sevket Sabanci bought up the city\u0026rsquos two main shopping centres - Bon Accord and St Nicholas - as well as some surrounding property five years ago.  But the tycoon - whose family is one of Turkey\u0026rsquos most powerful - did so through a complex series of tax haven holdings meaning his name has never been mentioned.  Now Mr Sabanci\u0026rsquos holding firm, The Herald can reveal, has quietly revealed its ownership after its offshore dealings emerged in the Turkish press through the giant \u0026ldquoParadise Papers data leak of late last year.  Staff contacted by The Herald were unaware of any Turkish beneficial ownership of the centres.    Sevket Sabanci\u0026nbsp  News media have previously named other entities as owners of the centres. Most recently, Aberdeen\u0026rsquos city paper, The Evening Express, described a UK business called Capreon as Bon Accord\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoowner. This is incorrect.  A spokesman for the firm said: \u0026ldquoCapreon is the Asset Manager for the owners of the shopping centre, called Aberdeen Shopping Centre Ltd. This organisation is backed by a group of investors, which includes the Sabanci family.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspAgenda: Morality, not legality, should be the last word on the Paradise Papers  The Herald can confirm that the property is held by two companies registered in the tax haven of Guernsey called Aberdeen Shopping Centre Limited and Aberdeen Shopping Centre Limited No2.  It is not unusual for retail property in the UK to be owned offshore, including in the Channel Islands.  SNP MP Kirsty Blackman, whose Aberdeen South constituency includes the shopping centres, has been campaigning on corporate transparency in the House of Commons.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe Bon Accord Centre has been a fixture in Aberdeen\u0026rsquos town centre for nearly 30 years. It\u0026rsquos part of the fabric of our city and it\u0026rsquos concerning to note that there are questions relating to its ownership.  \u0026ldquoOne of the problems with the UK\u0026rsquos system is that ownership of places like the Bon Accord Centre can be really opaque and, in some cases, pretty much impossible to trace.  Mr Sabanci and some other family members and other investors have a firm called Esas Holdings, its best known asset is the Turkish low-cost airline Pegasus. Esas has confirmed its owns the Aberdeen shopping centres.    Kirsty Blackman  Back in 2013, Bon Accord and St Nicholas were said to have been sold for \u0026pound189m to a firm called F\u0026ampC Reit, whose property wing was bought out last year by the Noe Group, parent of Capreon.  Details leaked from the Paradise Papers - documents from a law firm called Appleby - published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists shows Mr Sabanci other family members and investors as the beneficial owner of Scottish Retail Property GP Limited, a shareholder in both Guernsey-based entities controlling the shopping centres.

David Gill\u0027s secret\u0026nbspcurry recipes, gleaned from Indian crew mates in the Merchant Navy, are tempting return customers to drive the long and winding road to his door again and again.  After seven years at sea\u0026nbspMr Gill\u0026nbspworked as a roving marine engineer.  Then, when a back injury forced him to give\u0026nbsphis job up, he decided to follow his childhood dream and cook for a living.  With a garden shed sitting empty, he set to work transforming it into a takeaway, stocking everything from baltis and bhunas, to vindaloo, at \u0026pound4 a time.\u0026nbsp  The plan seemed the obvious choice as family and friends had long raved about his curries, to the point where he always\u0026nbspkept some in the freezer.  Now the 58-year-old, who lives\u0026nbspon the edge of\u0026nbspthe hamlet of Inverinan, where there are only ten houses, freezes his delicious dishes for customers to reheat when they eventually get back home.  Customers are much more likely to see sheep than people on the\u0026nbspsingle track road approaching the Black Rock take away, which\u0026nbspis 27 miles from Oban, four miles from the remote Argyll village of Kilchrenan on one side and the same distance to Dalavich on the other.  Now, with three seasons under his belt, Mr Gill, who is helped by wife Joanne,\u0026nbspsaid: \"We didn\u0027t know how popular we would become.  \"Although it is quite seasonal, when the school holidays are on we\u0026nbspget an influx of people from the holiday cabins at Dalavich.\"  Distance is no object for the takeaway\u0027s steady procession of loyal customers.\u0026nbsp  Mr Gill\u0026nbspsaid: \"A couple from Campbeltown, (a three and a half hour drive from Inverinan) are regulars customers,\u0026nbspthey take away a stack of curries every month, I think they drive here when they are doing their shopping in Oban.\"  The takeaway, which is usually unmanned, uses an honesty box payment system, so it can operate seven days a week from 10am -10pm and the couple have never had anything stolen from the shop, which also stocks Indian starters, chutneys, pickles and tasty desserts.  Mr Gill,\u0026nbspwho\u0026nbsptucked in to\u0026nbsphis first Vesta boil-in -the-bag curry as a child and his\u0026nbspfirst\u0026nbsp\"proper curry\" when he was a 17-year-old student in Tyneside, said: \"I have always been experimental with spices, when I was young I wanted to be a chef and learnt a lot of the basic stuff from my mother.  \"Then my\u0026nbspinterest in electronics came on and I was in the Merchant Navy as a Radio Officer for seven years, on board the oil tankers and that\u0027s where I picked up recipes and my love of spices, because I would sit with the crew and eat with the crew.  \"They would fish off the back of the vessel when we were anchored and then make a\u0026nbspred snapper\u0026nbspcurry.\"  He added: \"Friends and family used to come and have one of my curries, say it was lovely and that I could sell them. I used to have some stocked\u0026nbspin the freezer and they would say, can we take one home?\"  Now holidaymakers from all over the world call in at the takeaway, which now has two big freezer loads of frozen curries to choose from.  Mrs Gill, who helps with food preparation, stocking the shop and taking care of leaflet design and marketing,\u0026nbspsaid: \"As soon as\u0026nbsppeople see the sign, they stop and say what is this?

The kilted busker came to prominence after leading a pro-independence march\u0026nbspon the day of 2014\u0027s\u0026nbspreferendum, with flames shooting from the top of his bagpipes.  Last year, he was one of six members of the Scottish Resistance, a nationalist fringe group, who protested inside the Spanish Consulate in support of Catalonia.  Mr Randall, from Las Vegas, was hoping to spend the rest of the summer in Scotland but is now facing being forced to catch a flight back to the US on Monday.  Home Office officials insist he needs a work visa as he plans to busk during the Edinburgh Festival. They also raised fears he may never have returned to America as he has no other income.  But Mr Randall and his fellow Scottish Resistance members have suggested the move is \u0026ldquopolitically motivated due to his campaigning past.  Veteran street protester Sean Clerkin insisted: \u0026ldquoHe has been very prominent in the independence movement, and in the referendum campaign and beyond that.  \u0026ldquoHe has come over here six previous summers and there was never a problem. It\u0026rsquos absolutely ridiculous. He should not be in Dungavel. It\u0026rsquos an abuse of his human rights.  Speaking to The Herald from Dungavel, Mr Randall insisted he had never needed a work visa in the past, adding: \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos probably because of the independence movement [campaigning].  He said: \u0026ldquoI have never missed a flight. I have always been on time for my return flight back to America \u0026ndash and this is my sixth year coming to Scotland.  He admitted he did have a warrant issued against him after failing to pay a $1,000 fine for \u0026ldquoobstructing a pavement while busking in Las Vegas, but said this was not brought up by UK officials.  A Home Office spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoNon-EU nationals seeking to enter the UK as visitors are not permitted to work. Those intending to work in the UK require the appropriate visa to do so."},{"url":null,"title":"younger-women-attracted-to-church-of-scotland","story":"  There has been a modest yet more widely significant increase in the number of young women seeking to enter the clergy, it is claimed.  The news comes as the Church of England, the Kirk\u0027s counterpart south of the border, said young women view becoming a priest - as opposed to a minster in Scotland - as an \"increasingly attractive\" job, according to the CofE\u0027s representative in the Commons.  The Church of Scotland - which has had a progressive approach to women in ministry as well as gay ministers - this year celebrated 50 years of female clergy.  It said it has nearly 200 female ministers, and this year they marched through Edinburgh to show their strength and conviction, stopping only to decry the sexism of John Knox, a founding father criticised for his views on the \"monstrous league of women\" in reference to female leadership.  The Kirk said women were increasingly playing a leadership role that has influenced even traditional corners of the once male dominated pulpit.  Rev Louise Mackay, 29, was the youngest woman minister in the Church of Scotland when she was ordained and inducted into St Nicholas Church in Lanark, South Lanarkshire in January, 2017.  She said: \u0026ldquoI would certainly recommend a career in ministry to other young women.  \u0026ldquoEvery day is different and that\u0026rsquos something I enjoy a lot.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a vocation and a way of life and I love it.  \u0026ldquoAs a woman and a young woman, I bring a different perspective and set of gifts to my ministry.  \u0026ldquoA man will also bring a perspective and gifts to ministry.  \u0026ldquoIt seems to me that both are needed.  \u0026ldquoPeople often tell me that I have changed their views of what a minister is.  \u0026ldquoPeople tend to think of ministers as older, whether men or women, so they are sometimes quite surprised that I am a minister.  \u0026ldquoBut many people have told me they think it is a good thing and that is encouraging and a good sign for the future of the Church.  At this year\u0027s General Assembly of the Church of Scotland women marched upon the annual Kirk gathering place in Edinburgh in show of solidarity.  A Church of Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis year is the 50th anniversary of the ordination of women to the ministry of word and sacrament and today we have 194 ordained women ministers, which is a quarter of the total number of clergy working across Scotland, England and overseas.  \u0026ldquoIn the future we expect that proportion to rise since almost equal numbers of men and women are entering ministry with our Church.  \u0026ldquoIn 2017, we had 38 female applicants and 40 male applicants for ministry training and of the 38 female applicants, three are under the age of 30.  \u0026ldquoWomen have been appointed to senior posts within the Church.  \u0026ldquoThe current Moderator, for example, is Rt Rev Susan Brown, a parish minister from Dornoch in the Highlands, who is the fourth woman to have been chosen to serve as the Kirk\u0026rsquos ambassador at home and abroad.  Church of England data released last year showed more women than men were starting training as priests for the first time in 16 years.

In those hot summers there was a swagger about the Orangemen that seemed rooted in a confidence that comes from knowing your place in society and in the certainty that it was near the top of it. In the decades that have since passed that confidence has steadily evaporated and there is little certainty about anything. How could there be? The pillars that once upheld and reinforced their view of the world have crumbled and what remains is under siege.  The Conservative and Unionist Party in Scotland, once a citadel of intellects like Malcolm Rifkind, Michael Forsyth and George Younger, is now the preserve of an assortment of backwoodsmen whom you wouldn\u0026rsquot trust to return safely with the messages. The Church of Scotland is a mere husk of what it once was susceptible to every passing populous whim and calling it \u0026lsquoinclusiveness\u0026rsquo. The factories and yards that once guaranteed well-paid employment and security of tenure have vanished and the once downtrodden Irish Catholic community has risen to a position of genuine influence in politics, media and the senior professions.  Orange Parades in 21st century West of Scotland are a shadow of what they once were. The Order, once a power in the land, now has little influence and its most faithful followers reside in some of Glasgow\u0026rsquos most deprived neighbourhoods. Where it once exuded self-confidence and poise, now there is only defiance and resentment. They have become marginalised and yet that which they hold dear still has a place in this modern Scotland of many cultures.  The assault carried out last Saturday on Canon Tom White and the verbal abuse of some members of his congregation in the east end of Glasgow marked the lowest point of the Orange Order in Scotland. It\u0026rsquos beyond dispute though, that none of the actual marchers were responsible for this and that these were the actions of less than a handful of those rag-tag watchers who walk alongside the parade. The Order was quick to condemn the assault and stated its desire to work with the police to identify the perpetrators. In recent years it has emphasised its non-sectarian nature. It exists merely to uphold the Protestant faith, loyalty to the crown and support for the Union.  The condemnation of the attack has been universal and was followed by loud calls for all Orange parades in Glasgow to be banned. An on-line petition calling for an end to them has attracted 75,000 signatures. This attack shouldn\u0026rsquot have happened and the Orange Order now has a formidable task on its hand to ensure that it doesn\u0026rsquot fade into oblivion on the wings of public censure.  I get queasy though, when all the usual outriders of enlightened, diverse and multi-cultural Scotland start to assemble moral firing squads. At times like this some people get rather selective in their interpretation of what it means to be cosmopolitan and inclusive. I\u0026rsquom thinking of the sanctimony of dunces that comprise the swollen ranks of Scotland\u0026rsquos liberal elite who all pile in to condemn movements and traditions that don\u0026rsquot fit with their cosy, chi-chi agendas.  I suspect that many who signed the on-line petition banning Orange parades, even though they represent the inalienable right to march for the faith and the crown, will also be among those are never slow to condemn the Catholic Church for being too Catholic. This usually occurs when the Catholic Church seeks to uphold its belief in the sanctity of all human life and the nature of holy matrimony.  The same people who condemn bullying and intimidation of women gleefully display photos on social media of female Orange marchers and cruelly mock their looks and their shape. These women simply wanted to have their big day out with family and friends \u0026ndash just like all of us who love our right-on political marches \u0026ndash only to see themselves humiliated by a dreadful posse of sneering liberals on social media.  The Catholic hierarchy, which has been vociferous in its condemnation of last week\u0026rsquos incident, really ought to be careful here. It\u0026rsquos fond of playing the victim card by portraying sporadic incidents like these as indicative of a pernicious, nationwide attack on their church. There are indeed pockets of anti-Catholicism here and there across Scotland but the damage this has caused the Church is as nothing compared with the decades of clerical sex abuse and subsequent attempts at cover-up by its own leaders and professional factotums. The enemy of the Catholic Church in Scotland isn\u0026rsquot the Orange Order, it\u0026rsquos the ranks of militant atheist humanists amongst our political classes. These people affect horror at last week\u0026rsquos assault in the knowledge that it will give them ammunition in their ultimate quest to make inclusive, enlightened and tolerant Scotland a Christian-free zone.  Let\u0026rsquos speak frankly here (and I do so as a committed supporter of an independent Scotland). We simply cannot, in a mature and diverse Scotland go around banning marches because we don\u0026rsquot like the look of them. We nationalists are no strangers to the odd urban peregrination and big displays of flag-waving. This weekend tens of thousands of us will also indulge our human right to be extremely rude about a visiting US president while a few hundred Scottish firms and their employees hope that their American clients turn a blind eye. The Orange Order though, is considered fair game because they\u0026rsquore a bit rough and unkempt and they don\u0026rsquot support the economy of Byres Road.  Instead of trying to exploit this crisis in the Orange Order, the Catholic hierarchy should be reaching out to them to seek an accommodation regarding the number of marches and some of their traditional routes. When the big push comes to outlaw all \u0026lsquounacceptable\u0026rsquo symbols of Christianity in Scotland these two will be the last defenders. We should both get to know each other a little better."},{"url":null,"title":"agenda-by-susan-aitken-glasgow-intends-to-take-a-strong-stance-on-marches","story":"  A WEEK ago a priest and his congregation in the city I lead were subjected to a vile, anti-Catholic attack. The perpetrators had attached themselves to the Orange Order\u0026rsquos biggest event in Scotland, Glasgow\u0026rsquos annual Boyne Parade.  Spat at, verbally abused and then lunged at with poles simply for their faith, that this happened in 21st century Glasgow, a cosmopolitan, vibrant, multi-ethnic city is abhorrent. Modern Scotland prides itself on tolerance. What we cannot tolerate is hate crime, sectarian, racist or otherwise.  There is a growing public mood that we\u0026rsquove reached tipping point with behaviours associated with this type of event. The Orange Order, its individual districts and lodges, and other Loyal Orders may want to ask themselves what message the attitudes of those aligning themselves with their events send out about Scotland, about Glasgow and indeed about themselves and their proclaimed values.  Official participants may not be involved in sectarian and anti-social incidents around parades but it\u0026rsquos simply not enough to absolve themselves by pointing to hangers-on. They need to step up and take wider responsibility for those they attract and refer to as their wider support and networks when it suits. What happens on your watch happens on your watch.  In their repeated protestations of their religious and civil liberties, what about the religious and civil liberties of others? These parades are largely in honour of the Crown and take place \u0026ldquoon the Queen\u0026rsquos Highway. Those involved might want to ask themselves why the Queen has never attended any of their events or would she indeed feel remotely comfortable at one?  In the coming weeks and months several more parades are scheduled to pass St Alphonsus\u0026rsquo Church in the east end. If the organisers had any self-awareness they would re-route and avoid local potential flashpoint. I hope they voluntarily agree it is unacceptable for them to continue to pass these places of worship. If they do not, Glasgow City Council will insist.  We are ready and willing to strength-test existing laws and our own codes of conduct in relation to preventing horrendous incidents like the attack on Canon Tom White.  Were there an easy solution however to the wider issue of parades and processions it would have been found long ago. The issue has been explored and examined by local government, parliamentarians and chief constables at various stages in recent times. And the powers which councils have is extremely limited.  We are governed primarily by the European Convention on Human Rights. It permits freedom of assembly to all and any, including those we disagree with. And the key principle of the 2006 Scottish Parliament guidance on parades is that the role of councils is to facilitate, not to adjudicate on who can and can\u0026rsquot. Ideology and costs are not factors. The law is explicit in what applies to one parade, applies to all.  Only where the police have intelligence of significant and serious disorder do they object, allowing parades to be either prohibited or re-routed. And it\u0026rsquos worth stating that Orange parades are not the only marches where police action has been required in the past year.  Parliamentarians too might want to ask themselves whether they are satisfied the laws they put in place are fit for purpose. I have urged them to do just that. Importantly, incoming legislation providing a legal definition of a \u0026ldquosectarian aggravated offence will allow us to accurately measure hate crime at these and other parades.  Organisations of all faiths kinds have the freedom to parade in Scotland. But with freedom comes responsibility. Marchers and their support need to show the public they get that."},{"url":null,"title":"teach-children-about-trade-unions-says-jeremy-corbyn","story":"  Youngsters should be \u0026ldquofully equipped to develop and exercise their rights in the workplace, according to the Labour leader.

Named as Fishing News 2017 ‘Port of the Year’ Peterhead Port handled a record £195million worth of fish during 2017. The port is currently undergoing a £51 million investment and opened the UK’s biggest fish market in June, landing a huge sale of 5,990 boxes on opening day.                                                     Nearby Fraserburgh Harbour, also an important fishing port, has been diversifying, recently being announced as the preferred port for the Moray Offshore Renewable scheme as a base for operation and maintenance of renewable projects being developed in the Moray Firth.                                                     The Council worked with the harbour to support its bid and roads and transportation teams are continuing to provide logistical support as necessary to both Fraserburgh and Peterhead ports.        Global energy firm Equinor and its partner Masdar recently unveiled their Batwind project in Peterhead, for the first time making it possible to store energy produced from an offshore wind farm.Electricity produced at the world’s first floating offshore wind farm, Hywind Scotland, located 25km off the coast of Peterhead, will be transported via cables to an onshore substation where 1 MW batteries are placed and connected to the grid. The battery capacity is the equivalent of more than 128,000 iPhones.As the wind isn’t always blowing, energy storage technologies like batteries are expected to become increasingly important to secure grid stability as renewable energy becomes ever more significant.And in agriculture, the council’s Garioch Area Committee recently approved planning permission for an expansion of Thainstone Mart, supporting an application designed to assist the local industry’s long term future.

Five of the firms’ 14 employees have been made redundant with immediate effect, while the remaining employees have been retained to assist the administrators to realise the companies’ assets, including four sites currently being developed in Peterhead, Burntisland, Keith and Kemnay and Peterhead.Deveron Homes was established in 2002 and the construction arm was incorporated in 2008. In recent years, both businesses encountered challenges and delays on a number of development projects.The resulting additional costs, combined with difficult conditions in the sector and the wider challenges in the Aberdeenshire housing market, left the firms with reduced margins, significant levels of debt and a lack of funding to acquire new sites.Following an assessment of the immediate funding requirement, the directors determined they had no choice but to place both companies into administration to protect the creditors’ position as best as possible.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Saturday 14 Jul 2018 3:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Halkirk butcher hangs up his apron for the final time","story":"IT was the end of an era in Halkirk as local butcher Hugh John MacKay hung up his shop apron for the last time.Hugh, who ran MacKay\u0026rsquos of Halkirk as well as the Lifestyle Express grocery store, decided to retire after five decades of service.However, the Bridge Street butcher\u0026rsquos shop will still be run by a MacKay as Hugh\u0026rsquos son Matthew will take overHugh was the third in line of MacKays who owned and ran the butcher\u0026rsquos shop for the Halkirk community.Hugh grandfather, John, started the enterprise with a store in Lybster before setting up the shop in Halkirk then it passed on to Hugh\u0026rsquos dad \u0026ndash who was also named Hugh \u0026ndash with his uncle Angus taking over the Lybster shop before handing it over to his son, David.As for the Halkirk shop, Hugh, now 68, was only 16 his father died, \u0026shyleaving the family to take over the running of the shop.Hugh revealed it would not have been a success without the determined work of his mother, Belle.He said: \u0026ldquoI had just turned 16 when my father passed away.

The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care.

He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed.

They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies.

I found countless deserted and remote beaches piled high with it \u0026ndash plastic bottles, cotton-bud sticks, fishing gear, plastic bags, she said.\u0026ldquoThe worst-affected beaches in Scotland were on the west coast. On the east coast there was noticeably less on the beaches, but I was still paddling past beaches with nesting birds that had multicoloured plastic littering them.\u0026ldquoPaddling up the north-east coast, and particularly around Duncansby Head, I picked up several large plastic bags.\u0026ldquoThe inland canals were the worst affected. One morning in Wigan I counted 691 plastic bottles just in the first hour of paddling.Cal admitted that the marathon paddle was not without a scary moment or two.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Mull of Galloway paddle was one of the more terrifying moments. Storm Hector was approaching, so I had just one window to get around the Mull.\u0026ldquoI set off at 11.30pm, just as it had got dark, and paddled 14 miles across Luce Bay.\u0026ldquoThe darkness made it very hard to navigate so I used GPS and, once I could see lights on the opposite landmass and the lighthouse at the Mull, I focused on that.\u0026ldquoWith the Isle of Arran, I set off with a five-hour window to get to Arran before a storm was due to come in.\u0026ldquoThe winds were strong the entire time, mostly behind me but enough of a crosswind to make the paddling incredibly challenging and painful. When I was 12 miles across, the waves were almost as big as me and the storm came in early. I was very scared and felt very alone \u0026ndash panic was starting to set in.\u0026ldquoOnce I was within a mile of the island, and knew I was safe, fear turned to exhilaration, and the feeling of being propelled along by 20-30 knot winds was incredible.Saturday 14 Jul 2018 3:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Water levels as low as 1976 on River Thurso","story":"WATER levels on the River Thurso have been at their lowest in decades during the recent dry spell, according river expert Eddie McCarthy.Mr McCarthy, who retired as river superintendent in 2016, has manned the river for 37 years and says that the dry weather of the past few weeks has resulted in water levels comparable to those in the 1976 heatwave.Levels in 1984 were similarly low.One or two anglers have travelled up for pre-booked fishing trips only to change their plans after seeing the low water.However, overall this has had minimal impact on the river angling business, according Mr McCarthy.\u0026ldquoThe anglers are usually quite hardy, he said. \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquoll take their golf clubs up or will go trout fishing.Despite the rain returning on Monday, Mr McCarthy is unsure when the water levels will return to normal. \u0026ldquoWe need 72 hours of proper rain for it to rise.

A review will take place 12 months after the start of the new timetable in order to establish the long term future of the bus service to Gills Bay.Trudy Morris, who chairs the Caithness Transport Forum, said: \u0026ldquoWe are very pleased to see that Stagecoach has listened to the local community and agreed to secure the bus link to Gills Bay for a further 12 months. Not only will this bring benefit to local bus users, who would otherwise be isolated in their communities, but it also has potential to benefit the tourist market, providing services to link with the Gills Bay ferry.However, she is concerned about the review in 12 months time and said: \u0026ldquoWe will be working with Stagecoach and the local community to see what can be done to promote usage of the route, and will also be discussing with public sector partners such as Highland Council to see what might be done to secure the route on a non-commercial basis in future.Bill Mowat, the chairman of Gills Harbour Ltd, claimed public pressure had an impact on Stagecoach and pointed out there was strong opposition to the plan.Saturday 14 Jul 2018 3:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 14, 2018 at 11:30 amThe Orkney Native Wildlife Project is urging landowners help tackle Orkney\u0026#8217s rising stoat population by allowing their property to be checked.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will help reduce the initial barrier of connection for a defined period of time.Two events are planned at the St Magnus Centre in Kirkwall, from 6pm to 8pm on Wednesday July 11 then from 10am to 12pm on Thursday July 12 with a further event at the Doubletree by Hilton, Glasgow Central, from 10.30am to 12.30noon on Friday July 13 and finally, a webinar will take place on Tuesday July 17 from 10am to 12pm.Registration is required for the Alternative Approach consultations via the following link: https://www.ssen-transmission/news-views/articles/2018/6/solving-orkney-s-catch-22/Commenting on the Alternative Approach consultation events, Lauren Milligan, commercial policy manager, said: “As a customer-driven initiative, stakeholder engagement has shaped the Alternative Approach proposal to date.“We want to ensure that we develop a solution that not only works for network companies but also the wider industry and other connection customers and would therefore encourage anyone with an interest in our proposed Alternative Approach trial to register for one of our consultation events.”The final stage of consultation is planned to take place in Autumn on the various components of the transmission reinforcement project in advance of submitting planning applications to the relevant planning authorities, the Scottish Government, Marine Scotland and Orkney Islands Council.The progression of the project is subject to all necessary planning consents and securing regulatory approval from industry regulator Ofgem, with the Alternative Approach trial also subject to regulatory approval.For more information on the proposed Orkney transmission reinforcement, including links to both consultation documents, click here.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Saturday 14 Jul 2018 3:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In more recent times, it has seen the fairytale rise of Ross County from Highland League to Premiership \u0026ndash and a notorious Town Hall appearance by the Beatles when the Fab Four were on the brink of global success.Now, history hunters are being targeted by DCDC which has sought to work with the public to create a new vision of the town.Fascinating facts are being assembled by Dingwall History Society for panels dotting the town and shining light on its rich past.Secretary\u0026nbspSandra MacDonald said: \"Dingwall has a very long and significant history and we have the information available.\"The group will gather facts and suggest significant sites worthy of interpretation but will not have the final say.Mrs MacDonald, whose late husband David \"DD\" MacDonald chaired the society for a decade, said: \"There are the obvious sites like the Tollbooth \u0026ndash the tower and the clock.\"Other sites being considered include the war memorials at Station Square and the Hector Macdonald Monument and Moot Hill in the Cromartie Memorial car park, where the Vikings are believed to have held gatherings.Mrs MacDonald added: \"A board can carry a minimum amount of information but can indicate where people can access far more online.\"DCDC secretary Robin Lingard revealed the heritage trail is one of several items being proposed by the group, set up as a charity two years ago to tap funding pots for improvements. He told a recent open meeting that membership had more than doubled. \"We are very pleased,\" he said. \"I think out of it new ideas will come forward.\"Community activist George Murray, project manager for Dingwall Means Business, targeting the establishment of a business improvement district (BID), said: \"I think the DCDC is the perfect body to spearhead and develop plans like the heritage trail. I see it as being beneficial not only for local community development and participation but also as a way of presenting our community heritage to the world, especially as we get busier with the advent of the cruise tour coaches beginning to discover the town and the success of the NC500 route.\"If suitable funding can be put in place a heritage trail round the area could be a real boon to the town.\"Dingwall councillor Angela MacLean said a trail is \"a fantastic opportunity\" to showcase the town.She said: \"Many of the DCDC group\u0026rsquos wish list buildings are in the ownership of the Highland Council and if DCDC or another local group would like to take over and run of any of these buildings I am more than happy to lend my support. I would also like to congratulate DCDC for the work they have done so far and look forward to working with them to make some of their proposals a reality over the coming years.\"\u0026bull What do you think about the idea?

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4768865.1531573986!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon leads scotland largest pride parade in glasgow","story":"        Nicola Sturgeon has led off thousands of marchers at Scotland\u0026#8217s lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) pride event.

Ms Sturgeon was named honorary grand marshal for the event in recognition of her long-standing support for LGBTI equality.She was joined by a cross-party group of MSPs at the start of the parade, including Green co-convener Patrick Harvie, Liberal Democrat Alex Cole-Hamilton, Conservative Jamie Greene and the SNP’s Christina McKelvie.Thousands of people, many carrying rainbow flags or holding placards, marched behind as the parade crossed the river and headed through the city to Kelvingrove Park.Ms Sturgeon said earlier: “I’m proud that Scotland is considered to be one of the most progressive countries in Europe regarding LGBTI equality and Pride Glasgow is a fantastic event that brings communities together and celebrates all that LGBTI people bring to Scottish life.READ MORE: Glasgow pride rainbow crossing installed at shopping centre\u2028            “As a society we must champion equality and fairness at all times and defend the progress that has been made.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4768716.1531508333!/image/image.jpg","title":"john mclellan bojo s barmy army is polishing a t d","story":"        Scots Tory MP Ross Thomson\u0026#8217s claim that the UK is set to be \u0026#8216vassal state\u0026#8217 under Theresa May\u0026#8217s Brexit plan looks like pitch to join a future Cabinet under Boris Johnson, writes John McLellan.                The former editor of this newspaper, Magnus Linklater, must shake his head when he sees Boris Johnson bumbling purposefully onto the next publicity stunt, remembering the time when he defeated Bojo in one of the more bizarre elections Edinburgh has witnessed.            In 2006, Linklater’s 3,052 votes were enough to see off Johnson’s challenge to be rector of Edinburgh University, a bid no-one quite understood given the 41-year-old Johnson was already the high-profile MP for Henley and shadow Higher Education spokesman, and had no known connection with the university.             Instrumental in mounting Johnson’s Edinburgh challenge was my old chum Brian Monteith, the then Tory MSP who was to re-emerge at the heart of the Leave.EU PR operation. Even an inveterate plotter as Brian couldn’t have been preparing Bozza for Brexit 12 years ago, and the suspicion was it was just a profile-raiser. It worked as long as the campaign lasted, with a beer-drenching the highlight of a raucous campaign, but the PR bubble burst the minute he lost. In fact he came third, with Linklater second to the victorious Green MSP Mark Ballard.READ MORE: Donald Trump lashes out at Theresa May in extraordinary interviewIt might also have worked as a publicity stunt to attract more English public school types without enough A levels for Oxbridge or Durham, but Johnson has barely been seen in the capital since. His two terms as Mayor of London were regarded as a success, largely due to his flamboyant fronting of the London Olympics, but then came his calculating, cynical approach to the EU referendum. The twists of fate which followed the result saw his prime ministerial ambitions raised, dashed and then revived by Theresa May as her Foreign Secretary. Working out Johnson’s motivation has never been too difficult for those who know him well and selfless service has never been high on the list, but few have described his character with such elegant venom as another who resuscitated his career, former Daily  editor Max Hastings who hired him after the young reporter was sacked by The Times for fabricating stories in 1988.            “It is a common mistake to suppose Johnson a nice man,” wrote Hastings in, appropriately, The Times this week. “Johnson’s glittering intelligence is not matched by self-knowledge ... He is a man of remarkable gifts, flawed by an absence of conscience, principle or scruple. It has been a misfortune for Britain that through two years when diplomacy has been critically important we have been represented abroad by a jester.”One who would whole-heartedly agree is Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson who all but called him a liar as the EU referendum reached its climax and has followed it up with regular jibes ever since. She was one of the first out the blocks from outside the Cabinet this week to support the Prime Minister after Johnson’s resignation over the Chequers Brexit plan.But, at the same time, fundamentalist Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg and Iain Duncan-Smith were preparing amendments to the Customs Bill which, when it comes up for debate in the Commons on Monday, could yet rip the guts out the White Paper which followed the Chequers plan.READ MORE: Theresa May to Boris Johnson: ‘It is only right your should step down’            So what are we humble foot soldiers, the Conservative councillors and activists who must take all this out to the public, to make of it all? With a subject so vast boiled down to one word “Leave”, no party has found unanimous agreement within their ranks about what it should mean, no matter what they might tell the public. Even First Minister Nicola Sturgeon knows there are 400,000 SNP supporters like Jim Sillars who want as little to do with Brussels as they do London. The Prime Minister’s responsibility is to construct a viable way forward for the negotiations which honours the referendum result but addresses the realpolitik of the situation, which is what she appeared to have done. Not the finished article, but real progress nonetheless,  Good deal, bad deal or no deal (and every trader knows the other side must think you will walk away, no matter the consequences), what the poor bloody Conservative infantry need more than anything else is a sense of purpose and direction, a solid position we can defend and promote. Finally, last weekend we got one, until the egos started to land. The alternative to Ruth Davidson’s call to put “shoulders to the wheel” in support of the Chequers Plan is to play into the hands of the opposition. And guess what, as two party vice-chairs flounced out in protest, by the end of the week Labour had nudged ahead in the UK polls.Here, after we have fought so hard and effectively to get this far in Scotland, up chirruped Aberdeen South MP Ross Thomson. “The Brexit plan opening offer appears so diluted that we would be a vassal state,” he said, as if his seat was a UKIP target. Then, in what looked like a pitch to be Scotland Secretary in PM Bojo’s Barmy Cabinet, he went on to praise David Davis and Johnson for “standing by their principles”.             In the great game of Brexit, councillors like me are but bystanders like everyone else. Others are supposed to be looking after high affairs of state on our behalf as we get on with trying to get the roads fixed and the bins emptied, the licence and planning applications processed, the schools built.The aim for Team May, if I may be so bold, should be to get Brexit over the line, and the word from people a lot closer to this than me beyond the Conservative Party is that the key principles laid out in the Chequers blue-print, like customs alignment for manufactured goods and the end of free movement, are very close to doing just that. But by not seeking to answer every question now, detailed sector-by-sector negotiations can go into a phase where new relationships are forged at the right pace for each. The whips will be working overtime to avoid a defeat on Monday, but I will leave the final word to former Edinburgh councillor and MEP Struan Stevenson, whose poetry on Twitter took a slightly different approach to Ross Thomson:“An MP whose vision was blurred,Was an expert on polishing t**d.But his race to be crownedLeft him running agroundAnd looking faintly absurd...”And, in any case, as they say, you can’t polish a t**d, but you can roll it in glitter...”"},{"url":null,"title":"susan dalgety the party city where only musicians keep time","story":"        New Orleans has a soul like no other place on Earth and not even Mother Nature\u0026#8217s worst storms can break it, writes Susan Dalgety.                Death is everywhere in New Orleans. Its cemeteries, where the dead are buried above the ground because the city sits on water-logged earth, are a wildly popular tourist attraction.            So too are the gaudily painted coffins used at jazz funerals, while grinning skulls hang from the doorways of “authentic” voodoo stores, and the Museum of Death in the French Quarter boasts artefacts from serial killers and grisly crime-scene photographs.            “There have been a number of ‘falling down ovations’ (people fainting) so… prepare yourself before entering,” warns the museum’s website.It is perhaps not surprising that death is as much part of ‘N’awlins’ as Mardi Gras and jazz, given that life here is constant battle with Mother Nature, one that she usually wins.The city is squeezed onto a scrap of fragile land, sandwiched between the mighty Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain. Hurricanes batter its shores with crushing regularity, and with much of the city built below sea level, floods are a constant danger.Thirteen years ago, Hurricane Katrina, which claimed nearly 1,500 lives, destroyed half the city’s homes and decimated its population, almost broke its spirit.And the response of the Bush administration, which idled while New Orleans drowned, exposed the mighty US federal government as not only ill-prepared for a disaster that was all too predictable, but hard-hearted, bordering on racist.            It was mostly poor African Americans who were trapped in the city after the deluge, waving frantically from rooftops for help that was slow in coming, or sweltering for days in the fetid Superdome, without fresh water or sanitation. Everyone else had been able to flee.READ MORE: Susan Dalgety: A land born of racism and slavery returns to its rootsBut New Orleans has bounced back, as it has done many times since it was established 300 years ago. In a bitter foretaste of its future, the fledgling city was destroyed by a hurricane only four years after the first houses were built.“There is no other city like it in the USA,” explained Cordell, who finally made to the move from LA to NOLA – an acronym for New Orleans, Louisiana – a few months ago.            “I had been coming here a lot to party so, as I can work anywhere, it made a lot of sense to move here.“I have a condo just round the corner,” he went on, waving his bottle of IPA in the vague direction of his French Quarter flat. “It costs me a third of what I was paying in California, and I get all this.” All this is a non-stop party.We met Cordell in a bar frequented by locals, and the occasional wide-eyed tourists wandering in off the street, attracted by the raucous laughter.At four in the afternoon, the party was in full swing. James, squeezed into a silver, sequinned jacket three sizes too small, was drinking Bud from a champagne flute, while handing out stuffed toys from a large bag under his seat.“He always does that, he’s got a big heart,” explained Cordell, who came back from the bathroom with a penguin.            Shortly after we arrived, a roar went round the bar as another regular, rather the worse for wear, announced he was buying everyone a drink. Shots of Jameson were quickly poured in plastic glasses and passed round.Someone shouted, “this is going to be a night to remember!” Cordell shrugged and said, “I am not sure I want to stay forever in New Orleans, maybe there is too much partying. Perhaps I will travel ... Belize, or Spain, or south-east Asia. What do you think of Spain, or Portugal?”And before we could answer, the conversation turned, as it usually does, to “that man”.“I see you have a Baby Trump,” laughed Cordell. “That is a brilliant idea. He will hate that. God, we hate him. He is so embarrassing.“Obama was such a good president, you know. He was honest. Organised. Intelligent. He knew stuff. We were proud of him ... well, most of us.“Even George W was better than this man. He is a gangster, no, he is the worst gangster, a crack-head, low-life gangster. We are so angry, and ashamed.”READ MORE: Susan Dalgety: The fault line that runs through the big heart of the USThere was nothing more to be said about President Trump, so we bought another drink, and toasted New Orleans, a city like no other.Earlier in the day, we had visited Congo Square, in the Treme district, just beyond the fabled French Quarter and its hordes of drunken tourists, clutching plastic shot glasses, almost throttled by their cheap carnival beads.We were alone, except for the ghosts of Africans, stolen from their lands to be slaves in colonial Louisiana.Two hundred years ago, these men and women would gather every Sunday to remember their culture, to sing and dance and for a few, short hours, forget that they were no longer free.It was here, in this square, that the drums and banjos of Africa, suppressed elsewhere in buttoned-up Protestant America, merged with European influences and jazz was born.From the mid 19th century, the square was called Beauregard Square after a Confederate general, until 2011 when its original name was restored.“Jazz is the only truly indigenous American art form,” declared the city ordinance, “and arguably its genesis was Congo Square, a true gift to the entire country and the world.”That most Southern of gentlemen, the playwright Tennessee Williams, made New Orleans his home for much of his life.He once wrote, “In New Orleans ... I found the kind of freedom I always needed, and the shock of it, against the Puritanism of my nature, has given me a subject, a theme which I have never ceased exploiting.”New Orleans still has the capacity to shock. Bourbon Street after eight o’clock at night is not for the faint-hearted. Poverty still stalks the Lower Ninth Ward where Katrina did the most damage, and violent crime remains stubbornly high.It has been often been described as the worst-organised city in America, where the only people who keep time are the musicians.But it has a soul like no other city. A spirit rooted in the villages of West Africa, the plantations of Louisiana, and the shacks of Treme.The ancient rhythms and heartsick blues of New Orleans have lifted the world, soothed its soul, and made it want to dance.No-one, not even Mother Nature herself, can stop the life force that is N’awlins."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4768262.1531468928!/image/image.jpg","title":"progress at north sea s catcher field gives boost to premier","story":"        Premier Oil has hailed progress at a major North Sea field.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al.

Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells.

He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties.

miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best

conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27404  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nThe message must go loud and clear to London that the Backstop agreed in December is the bottom-line. - Mary Lou McDonald TD\nThe Brexit backstop agreed in December is the bottom line and must remain in place, Sinn Féin President Mary Lou has told the President of the EU Commission, Jean Claude Juncker. \nThe Sinn Féin President was speaking after the EU Commission President addressed a joint sitting of the Oireachtas in Leinster House today. \nAlongside the Sinn Féin TDs and Seanadóirí, Sinn Féin MPs and Martina Anderson MEP were also in the Oireachtas chamber for the speech. \nThe EU chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, was also in the gallery in the Dáil chamber for the speech. \nJean Claude Juncker told the joint sitting that \"Ireland will come first\" in the Brexit negotiations. \nHe also said dismissed the recent proposal from the British government for the backstop agreed in December to apply to Britain, saying it was  designed for the specific circumstances for the north of Ireland. \n\nThe EU Commission President also warned Britain that time is running out to come up with a deal. \"We need more answers and fewer questions,\" he said Oireachtas members and guests. \nMary Lou McDonald described Brexit as \"the biggest threat in a generation to our all-Ireland economy, our peace agreements and to the rights of our citizens\" and added that Ireland must not become collateral damage to the narrow agenda of right-wing British Tories. \nThe Sinn Féin President also said Theresa May and the British government have not put forward any credible proposals and said their approach \"remains littered with long-standing contradictions.\" \n\"The outworking of these unresolved contradictions in British policy is clear. As it stands, the British position would impose a hard border on the island of Ireland. That is a fact. As it stands the British position would erect barriers to east-west trade.

This specially commissioned artwork would enable every victim family to visit the site and to remember and respect and would immortalise the names of all those who had died, of whatever nationality, combatants and non-combatants, those who were killed in Ireland and those who were killed elsewhere.\" \n\nMr McLaughlin also called for a question on a future referendum on Irish unity to be included in the next census, due to be carried out in the north in 2021. \n\"Perhaps the most constructive contribution that a restored Executive, on in their absence, a Secretary of State could make would be to arrange for an appropriate question to be formulated for inclusion in the 2021 census that would permit citizens to declare their support for either of the two constitutional options described in the Good Friday Agreement. \n\"The inclusion of such a question would have no constitutional effect, however the objectivity of the process and collation of responses would be essential to a decision on a referendum on Irish unity and in itself an encouragement for developing rational and thoughtful debate.\" \nConcluding, the veteran republican said now is the time for political leadership. \n\"Clear and affirmative leadership is essential and it is long since time for the political parties in Ireland to initiate a national conversation and to engage and listen to each other as they set out goals, aspirations and entitlements for an agreed future,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27411  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nThe Occupied Territories Bill - proposed by Senator Frances Black - is expected to pass due to the support of Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil, Independents and Labour. \nSinn Féin Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile welcomed the legislation, he said: “Goods and services that are only available because of gross human rights abuses and violations of international law should not be available in Ireland.\n\n\"On a daily basis, Palestinian villages are demolished and residents displaced to make way for the construction of more settlements,” he said.\n\"The international community considers the construction of Israeli settlements as illegal under International law and in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. \n\"An EU report in 2017 outlined that continued settlement building places a great strain on efforts to reach a lasting and just resolution in the region.\"\nSenator Ó Donnghaile described the existence of settlements as a war crime and said the Irish government must comply with diplomatic and economic sanctions against the state of Israel.\n“The Irish government cannot on the one hand condemn these illegal colonial settlements and on the other hand freely trade with them.\n“This is the time for action and to make history.

McMonagle\n\nWhat we have witnessed here is a sustained and a calculated attack on the community of the Bogside, spilling into the Fountain and the whole of the city of Derry.\nThe people of Derry will take to the streets tonight to challenge what Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald has described as the \"warped, negative, regressive , and dangerous\" agenda of those behind the disturbances that have occurred in the city\u0027s Bogside area in recent nights. \nA rally in solidarity with the local community will be held in the city tonight at 7pm, supported by a range of parties and organisations, at Fahan Street/Butcher Gate. \nIt follows several nights of disturbances in the area which included a gun attack on PSNI officers, several blast bombs and dozens of petrol bombs. \nSome of those involved in the disturbances have been young children. \nThe Sinn Féin leader encouraged as many people as possible to attend tonight\u0027s rally to show solidarity with the people of the Bogside and Fountain and to send a clear message that there is no support for the violence witnessed over the last week. \nMary Lou McDonald made the comments in the Bogside this afternoon alongside Sinn Féin Deputy Leader Michelle O\u0027Neill as they met with local residents and community leaders and ahead of a meeting with PSNI Chief Constable, George Hamilton, to discuss the violence. \n\nSpeaking to the media at the Gasyard Centre in the Bogside, Mary Lou McDonald said those behind the violence had a \"warped agenda\" and \"cynical, calculated manipulation of young people.\" \n\"What we have witnessed here is a sustained and a calculated attack on the community of the Bogside, spilling into the Fountain and the whole of the city of Derry,\" she said. \n\"What we have seen here is a deliberate strategy by those who would style themselves as dissidents to misuse, mislead and manipulate children and to cause fear, hardship and anger across this community. \n\"But they have also created a sense of determination, Because this is Derry and because the Bogside is the Bogside and the people here aren\u0027t having it. This is the city of Martin McGuinness, of John Hume, of civil rights, this is the maiden city, these are proud communities and this evening the people of the Bogside and beyond will come on to the street and stand shoulder to shoulder to face the thuggery, the criminality, the manipulation and the warped thinking of a small, small minority of people who would wish to cause damage here,\" the Sinn Féin leader added. \nMary Lou McDonald also said the local community are angry and that what has happened is not a reflection of the vast majority of local people. \n\"This is every reflection on warped, negative, regressive , dangerous people who think it is OK to manipulate young people and young children to throw petrol bombs and the like for an agenda that is nothing but a road to absolutely nowhere bar anger, fear and destruction,\" she explained. \nThe Sinn Féin President also said the PSNI have a responsibility to keep people safe but laid the blame for the disturbances squarely on dissident groupings. \n\"There is a sense in the community that the police need to do more, that there needs to be a more effective engagement but let me be clear about this, we will talk to George Hamilton about all of those things but be clear here who the instigator of this hardship is, let\u0027s be clear on that.

interest in copper barns","story":"\nA unique housing development in Broughshane is attracting interest from international buyers.  \n\n                \nAntrim-based construction company Loft Estates is in the process of completing work on its award winning Copper Barns development, which sits on a 4.5 acre rural site overlooking Slemish Mountain and the Braid Valley. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe £1.3m investment in three state-of-the-art homes, was part funded by Danske Bank. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe company is

Dinsmore, Director at Loft Estates, said: “We have been overwhelmed with the public response to this project which has also received a RICS award for architecture.  \n\n“So far, we’ve sold two homes to legal professionals from London and there have been enquiries from around the world about the third and final property on the development.” \n\nHe added: “The homes are entirely bespoke and whilst they are very contemporary in design, the overall concept works because they relate back to the original stone barns they replaced.  \n\n“We have one barn remaining and will start this in conjunction with the new buyer so they can be involved in customising it to suit their own individual requirements.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n

we have with our Relationship Manager.  \n\n“We operate a number of businesses and a pension fund and Danske Bank really took the time to understand our quite varied needs across this portfolio, so it was an easy decision to switch.”\n\nMichelle Wilson, Business Banking Manager at Danske Bank, commented: “The Copper Barns development is the latest project from Connor and his team and as ever they continue to innovate and excite.  \n\n“A combination of award winning design coupled with quality driven construction has proven to be a winning recipe for the company and we are excited to see what
