There is no safe exposure to PM2.5, but the World Health Organisation recommends air is kept below ten micrograms per cubic metre.Professor Vance warned the ‘ultra-fine particles’ found in the house are known to deposit in organs such as the heart, liver, lungs and brain, adding: ‘Similar tiny particles are produced by diesel cars and have been linked to heart disease, stroke and lung cancer.’Professor Joost de Gouw, pollution expert at the University of Colorado, said: ‘All of us were just blown away by how high concentrations can get inside.‘You will be exposed for an hour, it’s not a few minutes... Roasting will see you exposed for two or three hours.’Scientists said toasters, alongside scented candles, wood-burning stoves, and gas cookers, could create pollution as people cook and clean inside their homes.          Scientists said toasters, alongside scented candles, wood-burning stoves, and gas cookers, could create pollution as people cook and clean inside their homes (file photo)A study by the University of Texas at Austin found that toasters release toxic particles into the air from the moment they are turned on, the Sunday Times reported.The safest way to make the breakfast food is to \u0027go for gold\u0027 and only allow the bread to become a light brown colour, experts said.Ms Vance said: \u0027When you make toast, the heating element starts warming up the debris and gunk in the toaster which includes oils.\u0027Add to that the bread itself - it\u0027s going to emit a range of things. We found ethanol, a by-product of yeast. If there\u0027s tiny pieces of bread touching the heating element you can see from the smoke, maybe from the crumbs at the bottom of the toaster - they will all make a lot of particles.\u0027It\u0027s led to what would be considered very unhealthy air pollution levels compared to the outdoor air quality standards.\u0027 The research team used advanced sensors and cameras to monitor the indoor air quality of a 1,200-square-foot manufactured home on the University of Texas at Austin campus.The pirate queens of the Caribbean: Fearless pair who...Four people are killed and suspect is in custody after...Share this articleOver the course of a month, the researchers conducted a variety of daily household activities, including cooking a full Thanksgiving dinner in the middle of the summer.The experiment\u0027s results are still pending, but Ms Vance said it is apparent homes need to be well ventilated while cooking and cleaning.Even basic tasks like boiling water over a stove top flame could contribute to high levels of gaseous air pollutants and suspended particulates, damaging health. Scientists noticed a surprising surge of toxic particles and chemicals when household cleaning sprays, scented candles and wood-burning stoves were used. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends no more than 25 micrograms of fine particulates per cubic metre should be found in the air.This is far less than the 3,000 to 4,000 particulate levels which were found in the atmosphere when toast was allowed to turn dark brown.Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from products such as shampoo, perfume, hairsprays and cleaning solutions are said to eventually make their way outside.    A study by the University of Texas in Austin found that toasters release toxic particles into the air from the moment they are turned on (file photo)These have been blamed for triggering asthma in children and worsening it in adults - and raising the risk of heart disease.VOCs also contribute to fine particle formation on a massive scale - making up an even greater source of global atmospheric air pollution than cars and lorries.Ms Vance, a mechanical engineer at the University of Colorado Boulder, said: \u0027Homes have never been considered an important source of outdoor air pollution and the moment is right to start exploring that.\u0027We wanted to know: How do basic activities like cooking and cleaning change the chemistry of a house?\u0027 Breathing in VOCs can inflame the eyes, nose and throat, cause difficulty breathing and nausea and damage the central nervous system.Carpets, vinyl flooring, paint, heating and cooking fuel also cloud households with them. The problem is worst in homes built in the past 20 years thanks to \u0027green\u0027 rules that require energy-efficient impermeable glazing and insulation.This means such homes do not breathe - and nor do older ones boosted to meet new standards.Air pollution causes about 40,000 Britons to die each year, according to studies by the Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.Evidence also shows air pollution causes more than six million sick days and costs an annual £22.6 billion in terms of ill health and disability - such as heart disease and lung conditions."},{"url":null,"title":"Cuba holiday stuff nightmares family arrive filthy toilets green pool","story":"      The Evans family from Stourport in Worcestershire booked their dream holiday to Cuba for mother Gayle\u0027s 50th birthday          It was their first ever holiday abroad together and they were left far from impressed with the standard of accommodation including this green swimming pool          The holiday cost the family £10,000 but five of them had stomach bugs during their stay and they were unhappy with the state of the bathroom facilitiesMrs Evans said: \u0027I just burst into tears.

There is no safe exposure to PM2.5, but the World Health Organisation recommends air is kept below ten micrograms per cubic metre.Professor Vance warned the ‘ultra-fine particles’ found in the house are known to deposit in organs such as the heart, liver, lungs and brain, adding: ‘Similar tiny particles are produced by diesel cars and have been linked to heart disease, stroke and lung cancer.’Professor Joost de Gouw, pollution expert at the University of Colorado, said: ‘All of us were just blown away by how high concentrations can get inside.‘You will be exposed for an hour, it’s not a few minutes... Roasting will see you exposed for two or three hours.’Scientists said toasters, alongside scented candles, wood-burning stoves, and gas cookers, could create pollution as people cook and clean inside their homes.          Scientists said toasters, alongside scented candles, wood-burning stoves, and gas cookers, could create pollution as people cook and clean inside their homes (file photo)A study by the University of Texas at Austin found that toasters release toxic particles into the air from the moment they are turned on, the Sunday Times reported.The safest way to make the breakfast food is to \u0027go for gold\u0027 and only allow the bread to become a light brown colour, experts said.Ms Vance said: \u0027When you make toast, the heating element starts warming up the debris and gunk in the toaster which includes oils.\u0027Add to that the bread itself - it\u0027s going to emit a range of things. We found ethanol, a by-product of yeast. If there\u0027s tiny pieces of bread touching the heating element you can see from the smoke, maybe from the crumbs at the bottom of the toaster - they will all make a lot of particles.\u0027It\u0027s led to what would be considered very unhealthy air pollution levels compared to the outdoor air quality standards.\u0027 The research team used advanced sensors and cameras to monitor the indoor air quality of a 1,200-square-foot manufactured home on the University of Texas at Austin campus.The pirate queens of the Caribbean: Fearless pair who...Four people are killed and suspect is in custody after...Share this articleOver the course of a month, the researchers conducted a variety of daily household activities, including cooking a full Thanksgiving dinner in the middle of the summer.The experiment\u0027s results are still pending, but Ms Vance said it is apparent homes need to be well ventilated while cooking and cleaning.Even basic tasks like boiling water over a stove top flame could contribute to high levels of gaseous air pollutants and suspended particulates, damaging health. Scientists noticed a surprising surge of toxic particles and chemicals when household cleaning sprays, scented candles and wood-burning stoves were used. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends no more than 25 micrograms of fine particulates per cubic metre should be found in the air.This is far less than the 3,000 to 4,000 particulate levels which were found in the atmosphere when toast was allowed to turn dark brown.Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from products such as shampoo, perfume, hairsprays and cleaning solutions are said to eventually make their way outside.    A study by the University of Texas in Austin found that toasters release toxic particles into the air from the moment they are turned on (file photo)These have been blamed for triggering asthma in children and worsening it in adults - and raising the risk of heart disease.VOCs also contribute to fine particle formation on a massive scale - making up an even greater source of global atmospheric air pollution than cars and lorries.Ms Vance, a mechanical engineer at the University of Colorado Boulder, said: \u0027Homes have never been considered an important source of outdoor air pollution and the moment is right to start exploring that.\u0027We wanted to know: How do basic activities like cooking and cleaning change the chemistry of a house?\u0027 Breathing in VOCs can inflame the eyes, nose and throat, cause difficulty breathing and nausea and damage the central nervous system.Carpets, vinyl flooring, paint, heating and cooking fuel also cloud households with them. The problem is worst in homes built in the past 20 years thanks to \u0027green\u0027 rules that require energy-efficient impermeable glazing and insulation.This means such homes do not breathe - and nor do older ones boosted to meet new standards.Air pollution causes about 40,000 Britons to die each year, according to studies by the Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.Evidence also shows air pollution causes more than six million sick days and costs an annual £22.6 billion in terms of ill health and disability - such as heart disease and lung conditions."},{"url":null,"title":"Cuba holiday stuff nightmares family arrive filthy toilets green pool","story":"      The Evans family from Stourport in Worcestershire booked their dream holiday to Cuba for mother Gayle\u0027s 50th birthday          It was their first ever holiday abroad together and they were left far from impressed with the standard of accommodation including this green swimming pool          The holiday cost the family £10,000 but five of them had stomach bugs during their stay and they were unhappy with the state of the bathroom facilitiesMrs Evans said: \u0027I just burst into tears.

Denise Coates with her CBE in May 2012Founded in a Portakabin in Stoke-on-Trent, Bet365 has grown into one of the world’s biggest online gambling firms with more than 35million punters on its books.Its founder, Denise Coates CBE, was last year paid an astonishing £265million in salary and idends – making her one of the world’s highest-paid female executives.The mother-of-five’s earnings – paid from Bet365’s £682.4m annual profit – are 9,500 times the average UK salary, and 1,300 times the Prime Minister’s.She has been praised for bringing renewed prosperity to the ailing economy of Stoke-on-Trent, where Bet365 employs 3,000 people in its steel-and-glass UK headquarters.          Coates, pictured with her father PeterYet campaigners argue her immense fortune has been built while the gambling industry faces growing criticism for failing to address the problems of addicts lured into frittering away more than they can afford by empty promises of easy money.Coates, 51, noticed the rise of gambling websites while working as an accountant for her father’s small chain of Midlands betting shops.She persuaded her family to mortgage the shops to go online and started Bet365 with her brother John, 47, the joint chief executive.Working from a cabin in a Potteries car park, they bought the Bet365 domain name for less than £20,000 and by 2005 had abolished the shops altogether.Since its launch in 2001, Bet365 has grown to become one of the biggest companies in the UK. It took £52.6 billion in wagers in the year to March 25 - up 12 per cent on the previous year.The business is highly regarded in the gambling industry for being at the forefront of emerging technology, such as ‘in play’ betting and live casino games.It is one of the most prolific advertisers during major sporting events. Its promotions are fronted by actor Ray Winston luring players into betting with his menacing Essex drawl.Bet365 owns the Premier League football club Stoke City - a passion for Miss Coates’s brother John, and for their 79-year-old father Peter, who is club chairman.Her pay packet is more than twice as much as the entire Stoke City wage bill.                                                     It did not look great when during our presentation on responsible gambling our trainer told us: ‘I hate this PowerPoint. But I have to do it.’ Cutting the ‘very dry’ document short, she took us through the issues via the website instead.She did explain that the company has a ‘moral responsibility’ to identify and protect potential gambling addicts. But to me this seemed somewhat at odds with our tutorial about returning money to people who had big losses, which would surely allow them to keep betting – and losing. We are shown Bet365’s ‘live casino’, for example, where players can wager on table games hosted by real-life named dealers. These are mostly women in revealing clothing working out of low-budget TV studios based in Latvia and the Philippines. These 247 live shows are produced by a third-party provider, but Bet365 pays them £10,000 a month to run tables carrying company branding. Our trainer jokes that the girls get more tips if they wear fewer clothes, which appeared highly inappropriate set against the harsh reality of Britain’s gambling problem. This country has 430,000 problem gamblers and further two million are at risk.Staff are clearly proud of the global success of Bet365 – which provides betting services to 35million people worldwide, most of them British – as our trainer tells us gleefully: ‘You can’t watch TV any more without Bet365 popping up everywhere.‘The amount of markets that we’ve got is huge … Really, really random ones. Third league football, reserves league. Really random ones. We’ve got volleyball, greyhounds, e-sports.’She reveals the company’s ultimate aspiration is to expand into North America, where it is currently not licensed to operate. ‘One day we might be … It would be lovely to have Bet365 on the Vegas strip next to Caesar’s Palace.’ For now, however, Bet365 bestrides the gambling industry from what our trainer describes as the ‘great tax haven’ of Gibraltar, where the company goes to great lengths to keep the details of their training programme and customer information from prying eyes. We were told: ‘Anything you do in this company stays within the four walls of this company. That includes your job, details of what your job title is … no information given to anyone outside.’Access to every room is controlled by scanners in staff ID cards which pinpoint our location in the building. All computer screens must be ‘locked’ if we are more than a metre from our desks, every document shredded after use.Such attention to detail has no doubt played a part in Bet365’s extraordinary success, and in the wealth of its £265million-a-year chief executive Denise Coates.But such wealth comes at a price. At one point, I ask our trainer if desperate customers are ever allowed to reclaim their losses.Describing ‘one of the worst conversations she ever had’, she recalls: ‘A person sent an email and it was pages and pages long – about how he’d spent his wedding fund on gambling and he needed to have these bets voided for him, otherwise he’d lose his future wife. It was horrendous to read. And you think, “you are at rock bottom – I would love to be able to just give you your money, but you’re probably going to do exactly the same thing in an hour’s time”.’We were told he was not given his money back."},{"url":null,"title":"Flock sheep Bedfordshire garden","story":"    Two-hundred sheep descended on the back garden of a semi-detached home in BedfordshireThe telecoms manager was left ‘shocked and bewildered’ when he looked into his back garden to find it packed with the farm animals grazing on the lawn.Their shepherdess – the aptly named Sally Shepherd, 27 – had been leading them through the village of Harrold, Bedfordshire, from one field to another on Friday afternoon. ‘We’d gone ahead and checked all the garden gates, so thought there was nowhere else for them to go but towards the right field,’ she said.

The sheep were moving through the village of Harrold, Bedfordshire, from one field to another‘I had to give the driveway a bit of a jet wash but it’s fine now, and the farmer has been round to check everything is OK.’Sheep have a strong instinct to walk after the animal in front and will even follow each other to the slaughter or off a cliff. ‘If they find a gap, one will go through it and inevitably the rest will follow,’ Miss Shepherd said. ‘But I’ve never seen 200 of them all pile into someone’s driveway.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Sir Jims profits principles writes RUTH SUNDERLAND","story":"    What a way for Sir Jim, the founder of Ineos, a multi-national chemicals company and a vocal Brexiteer, to behave towards Britain as it hurtles towards life outside the European Union.

She notoriously took a £1.2billion idend completely free of tax from her husband’s fashion empire in 2005What a way for Sir Jim, the founder of Ineos, a multi-national chemicals company and a vocal Brexiteer, to behave towards Britain as it hurtles towards life outside the European Union. He is following in the footsteps of fellow Brexiteer billionaire Sir James Dyson, who recently announced that he, too, is jumping ship by moving his company headquarters to Singapore.Unlike the majority of Britons, the two businessmen have the luxury of spouting their pro-Brexit opinions safe in the knowledge they are insulated from any of the consequences by their vast wealth. They can hedge their bets and cut their tax bills by shunting their assets – or themselves – offshore.And what a way for Ratcliffe to repay the honour of the knighthood bestowed on him by the Queen only last summer for services to business and investment. But in his mindset, patriotism and principle come a long way behind profit and personal enrichment.          Keeping afloat: Among his ‘boys’ toys’ is the superyacht Hampshire II, which cost £130millionAll of this is a terrible shame because there is much to admire about the 66-year-old tycoon.He is the first UK-born industrialist ever to top the Sunday Times Rich List, which he did last year with a fortune of £21billion. In fairness to Ratcliffe, he also appeared in that newspaper’s list of the UK’s biggest taxpayers for 2018 when he paid £110million.Ineos, the business which he created from scratch, is Britain’s biggest private company with a turnover of nearly £47billion and 19,000 employees in 24 countries. That’s a success in any estimation.          Rooms with a view: Aerial view of Sir Jim’s Hampshire mansion, one of several properties he ownsThe son of a joiner and an office clerical worker, he is living proof of how far determination, energy and hard work can take an entrepreneur. He is often described as self-made which is true – but he was in fact made in Britain – with the help of this country’s tax and social system. It was the public purse that paid for the council house, on Dunkerley Avenue in Failsworth near Oldham, where he spent his early years. Public money also financed the grammar school he attended, and his chemical engineering degree at Birmingham University in the days before student fees and loans.He was part of a post-war generation for whom dramatic social mobility was possible, thanks to taxpayer-funded housing and education.Now surely is his chance to acknowledge that, by paying taxes here with good grace. Instead, he is skulking off to Monaco. Unlike Gates, who acknowledges he does not ‘deserve’ his great wealth, it came through ‘timing, luck and people I work with’, Ratcliffe shows no trace of humility.          Contrast that attitude, the maturity and modesty shown by a titan like Bill Gates, with Ratcliffe’s tawdry plans to deprive the UK Treasury of huge sums in tax by moving to Monaco.The move looks like pure self-interest, and for what? He hardly needs the money: his wealth last year increased by an estimated £42million a day. He already has a superyacht, a grand home in Chelsea and an estate in Iceland, among many other assets.And he has more than enough to fritter on a partnership with Olympic sailor Sir Ben Ainslie to compete for the America’s Cup in 2021, on which he is reported to have spent £110million.Surely there are only so many vanity projects, toys and baubles any man could want.Sir Jim is a brilliant entrepreneur but does not seem to realise that with great wealth comes great responsibility.Ineos declined to comment when contacted by the Daily Mail. There is a little I agree on with Marxist shadow chancellor John McDonnell. But when he says ‘the greed of these super-rich tax avoiders seems to have no bounds’, it is hard to demur.Employing highly-paid accountants to avoid tax within the law plays straight into the hands of Labour under Jeremy Corbyn.How sad that a man like Sir Jim, who has achieved so much for Britain, has chosen a course of disloyalty and ingratitude when he could have emulated Gates and made his country proud. "},{"url":null,"title":"80 000 Daily Mail readers pledge pick litter Britain Tidys Great British Spring Clean","story":"More than 80,000 volunteers have pledged to join Keep Britain Tidy\u0027s Great British Spring Clean, which is backed by the Daily Mail.

The musical remake of her 1980s film that she leaves behind is proficient, but soulless.

They hope that ‘smoothing the cliff edge of prices’ with a sliding scale of fares will ease congestion by removing the rush on the first or last off-peak trains.But campaigners warned that adding even more ticket prices for the same journey risked adding to existing confusion.James Daley, from consumer group Fairer Finance, said: ‘The wide variety in prices for the same journey causes a lot of confusion at the moment. It’s clear we need reform and simplification but it would be very easy to come up with a system that’s even more confusing.

But the RDG claims that under its Easier Fares For All plan, passengers would automatically be charged the best-value fare.Rail chiefs blow £3million on flights for staff around the...Lawyer for passenger sued by Lufthansa for not using the...Share this articleUnder the new scheme, a commuter travelling in one direction during peak hours and the other during off-peak hours could save money by paying a cheaper fare on the off-peak journey rather having to buy a peak return ticket.Paul Plummer, chief executive of the RDG, said: ‘Reconfiguring a decades-old system originally designed in an analogue era isn’t simple, but this plan offers a route to get there quickly.’          Mike Richardson, director of split ticketing site Trainsplit, said: ‘Saying some fares will rise and some fares will fall could have a significant negative impact for a large number of passengers.’Darren Shirley, chief executive of the Campaign For Better Transport, claimed the existing fares and ticketing system is ‘broken and desperately needs fixing’.He added: ‘We’re particularly pleased to see proposals for more flexible commuter tickets to reflect modern work patterns. What’s not clear however, is if these proposals will also lead to an end to the annual fares rise, which fails to reflect the level of service passengers receive the previous year.’A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘We are ready to work with the industry on how their proposals might work and be tested in the real world.’Trials of changes to the fares system are expected to begin later this year. The new system could be rolled out over the next three to five years.The planned overhaul of rail fares could end the need for ‘split ticketing’, a trick used by passengers to save money.Due to Britain’s complex ticketing system, instead of buying just one ticket to the final destination, it can be cheaper to buy multiple to cover different stages of a single journey.But industry body the Rail Delivery Group claims split ticketing would not be necessary under its new plans as passengers would automatically be charged the best fare.Currently, you could save £40 travelling from Southampton to Manchester tomorrow morning by splitting the cost across eight different tickets, according to website Trainsplit.

If there are other ways of doing it that are just as effective that perhaps we haven\u0027t yet explored then we will do that too.\u0027He continued: \u0027I don\u0027t think it\u0027s the mechanism that matters, it\u0027s the objective: if you can get to a place where the potential longevity of the backstop, the potential that the backstop lasts forever can be adequately dealt with, that\u0027s what we\u0027re all seeking to do.\u0027That\u0027s what Parliament has been very clear that it wants, it will back this deal if we can do something about the backstop.\u0027            Jeremy Wright (pictured today on Marr) said the \u0027mechanism\u0027 for fixing the backstop was less important than getting legal guarantees on the protocol not lasting forever - despite critics saying the only fix is for it to be directly overhauled or deleted entirelyTheresa May’s Brexit unity plea shattered by leaked WhatsApp messages | News | The Sunday Times"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc1c29109016c98b7a40e746e45b32b4780cd0d2/0_0_5710_3777/master/5710.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebd2e60273177616971bfe74551d7db1 660w","title":"books about lgbt gay life john boyne","story":"As we mark LGBT history month, the novelist selects some classic, personal novels and true accounts of the battle for civil rightsIt’s a rite of passage for every young gay man to read Edmund White’s A Boy’s Own Story, the classic tale of a teenager coming to terms with his homosexuality. I first read it when I was 15 years old, hiding the book at the back of my wardrobe, terrified that anyone might find it and discover my terrible secret! It was dangerous, it was seductive, but it spoke to me in such a way that I felt sure it had been written for me alone, a conviction shared by many of its readers. White remains a hero, a stalwart, a champion for the ages.Young female readers experienced similar self-recognition in Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, Jeanette Winterson’s witty and personal 1985 novel about a girl navigating the road towards self-acceptance in 1960s England. As with White, Winterson shares so many of her own experiences in the book that the reader feels a deep connection with the author.Decades earlier, a generation of incredibly brave authors were writing about gay life at a time when newspapers and booksellers were reluctant to review or stock their books, but it’s impossible to imagine a literary landscape without Christopher Isherwood, Patricia Highsmith, James Baldwin or Gore Vidal, each of whom helped to convince readers that the lives of others were just as interesting as the lives they recognised.Because of them, many writers who might have been ghettoised as “gay fiction” have, through the quality of their work, successfully brought the counterculture into the mainstream. Sarah Waters, Philip Hensher, Emma Donoghue and Alan Hollinghurst are all hugely successful novelists whose work is read by readers of all sexualities. Thankfully, the days of EM Forster hiding the manuscript of Maurice under the mattress are long behind us.A heterosexual writer who has been at the forefront of championing LGBTQ rights for many decades is John Irving. In The World According to Garp, we meet the former NFL footballer Robert Muldoon, now Roberta Muldoon, a post-operative transsexual. For a writer to explore this subject in the late 1970s took a lot of guts and the book was an enormous success, establishing Irving’s career. It’s a subject he returned to in 2012 with In One Person, a novel about someone who is bisexual, which features several transgender characters trying to survive in contemporary America.In non-fiction, David France’s How to Survive a Plague has become the definitive study of the Aids epidemic and how it swept through a generation of young men in the 1980s and 90s. France writes about the terror that people felt as HIV and Aids took hold of communities, stealing the lives of so many, about the activists who brought it to public attention, the politicians who refused to speak about it, and the doctors and scientists who worked on treatments and cures.Similarly, Lillian Faderman’s long and involving book The Gay Revolution: The Story of the Struggle is an exhaustive and detailed account of the battle to win civil rights for members of the LGBTQ community and for those seeking same-sex marriages. Happily, young people in the west today face far less prejudice than those who went before them, but I would recommend it to anyone who wants to recognise the bravery of those who fought, and sometimes died, in order to build a more inclusive world.• John Boyne’s children’s novel My Brother’s Name Is Jessica will be published by Puffin in April.

That troubled border in the north-east of the island of Ireland runs for 310 miles along the middle of 11 roads, meets in the middle of at least three bridges and dissects two ferry crossings.These facts come from a joint report between the Republic’s Department of Transport and the Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure and are to be found in the Irish historian Diarmaid Ferriter’s richly detailed The Border: The Legacy of a Century of Anglo-Irish Politics.Northern Ireland was born in 1920 in a state of confusion, deception, compromise and dispute. Its status was and remains ambiguous, subject to differing interpretations and stubbornly resilient to agreement and, indeed, common sense. It’s no surprise, then, that its demarcation has been the scene of shifting priorities and influences, from a militarised zone to an invisible border no more obvious than a county line.But of all its roles none has been more freighted with ironies and misunderstandings than its current one at the centre of the UK’s hapless attempts to leave the European Union. In a metaphorical leap of international significance, the border has become the backstop in a withdrawal agreement that itself is a matter of feverish contention.The road from the border’s creation to its starring role in the UK’s ongoing identity crisis is a long, winding and sometimes bloody one. It’s also an old story but one that’s frequently been told from partisan perspectives. Ferriter is scrupulous in striving for historical objectivity, an effort that results in no party emerging with much credit.The British, as we might expect, were frequently guilty of saying different things to different people, just as the republicans were prone to hear what they wanted to hear. The unionists were as demanding as they were unyielding and loyal to a nation – the UK – for which they seemed to have little respect or understanding (a sentiment that was reciprocated with interest). And the leaders of churches on both the Protestant and Catholic sides often managed to make a bad situation worse.If the Unionists thought of themselves as the forgotten British, then the nationalists in the north had yet more cause to see themselves as the neglected Irish. The establishment of the Irish Free State and then the Republic created an intra-communal ide, with those in the south adopting an increasingly complacent distance from their troublesome brethren in Northern Ireland.Since the Good Friday agreement in 1998, the tensions that these competing forces had brought to bear on the border began to ease. Two decades later, it is a “frictionless” crossing in a real sense, rather than the one imagined by the Johnsonian Brexiters who speak, with a magical indifference to reality, of the borders between London boroughs as models for the post-Brexit relationship between the Republic and Northern Ireland.It’s perhaps worth noting that in the 1930s a trade war between Britain and Ireland, and the imposition of tariffs, led to a huge drop in cross-border exports but a widespread increase in smuggling. Of course, the world, and in particular Ireland, has changed a lot since then. The border has become not just the only land crossing between the UK and the EU, it is also the iding line between two significantly transformed societies.As Ferriter points out, one of the motivating factors in the unionists’ demand for a separate land of their own was a fear of being subsumed by Roman Catholicism. As paranoid as that anxiety sometimes sounded, it had some merit. For many decades after the border was imposed, the Catholic church enjoyed large and often malign influence in Irish politics and culture in the south.That has fallen away dramatically in recent years to the point that it can be convincingly argued that the Republic is a less religiously conservative society than the one across the border. And when religion is removed from the equation, the future begins to contain possibilities that were once inconceivable.For the foreseeable future, Northern Ireland is likely to remain part of the UK, and therefore the border will continue – long outlasting the ones between the two Germanys and the two Vietnams. But exactly what political shape it will take is a question that will do what it previously took bombs and paramilitaries to achieve: make the British political establishment take notice.• The Border: The Legacy of a Century of Anglo-Irish Politics by Diarmaid Ferriter published by Profile (£12.99).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Colm Tóibín’s Nora Webster has been keeping vermontlogger up at night:Another first-class read. A middle-aged mother, recently widowed, must learn to live a new life and shows a brave independence. Emotion is made to appear through writing of perfect clarity and simplicity.Towards the end I had a horrible certainty as to how it would finish and lay awake worrying.Dogbertd has a different kind of worry about Tolstoy:I hesitate to mention it, but I’m almost finished War and Peace. I say hesitate, because people tend to look at you a bit funny when you say you’re reading W\u0026ampP - my wife simply said “Oh my god” as if I’d taken leave of my senses. And I also hesitate because actually I’m re-reading it. According to the date inside the cover (Penguin, 2 volumes, Tr. Edwards) I last read this in 1974, when I was clearly much too young to really appreciate it, since I remembered nothing of it except that I thought the philosophical bits rather dull.I can see now that waiting 44 years to come back to it was a serious mistake. I suppose I was put off by its length and “classic” status, but I have to say it’s a cracking good read, and I’d recommend it to anyone: I’ve hugely enjoyed it.“My God, I’m having a hoot,” says MachenBach, who has been reading Markus Werner:I’m on Zündel’s Exit which is (as you say of the other) terse and bitter, but also full of great lines and belly laughs (Hoffman did the translation). Like a funnier Bernhard. It’s hitting the spot like you wouldn’t believe.A bold sequel to A Wizard Of Earthsea - bold in that it’s initially unclear that it bears any relationship to the first novel, other than being set on the same world (if you weren’t aware of the sequel, you might not have recalled that Atuan is even mentioned in AWOE).Like several others recently, SeriouslyLentil has rediscoverd Ice by Anna Kavan, “which I read decades ago and lost”:It really is astonishing, mixing post-nuclear apocalyptic disaster (new Ice Age) with feminism, often hallucinogen at times, dreamlike and sometimes stream of consciousness from an unreliable narrator searching for a strange, ephemeral girl and as ice closes in and the world turns to shit. Details are left vague and the three protagonists are nameless. The author spent most of her life addicted to heroin so there are obvious metaphors here. The writing is beautiful and I can only compare her descriptions of the freezing world as similar to Doris Lessing’s The Making of the Representative for Planet 8.Bill Bryson’s A Walk In The Woods has worked its magic on sblejo:Describing the frustrations of ‘camping’ on the Appalachian Trail with little or no equipment, walking for miles in hopes of encountering the next small town with motel and restaurant, and the revelations of walking with his friend Katz who is in no shape to take on such a trial. All true, very enlightening, not only about human nature but about the dismal ‘care’ the U.S. National Park System and associates ‘lavish’, so to speak on unforgettable, fabulous nature, out there for any of us to partake. Of course there are always the spoiled Ralph Lauren hiking outfit types, simply out for a night of camping and extreme drinking. Altogether an entertaining, wonderfully hilarious and thought-provoking comment on society, history, nature and ourselves.Finally, NicolaVintageReads has discovered an unfortunate truth in a Raymond Chandler novel:Racing through Raymond Chandler’s Philip Marlowe novels which I’ve never read before. Plots utterly confusing but what a great writer. I loved Marlowe’s advice on giving up alcohol:“It’s a different world. You have to get used to a paler set of colours, a quieter lot of sounds, you have to allow for relapses. All the people you used to know well will get to be a little strange. You won’t even like most of them and they won’t like you too well.”If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

To Volker Spitzenberger, who has lived here since 2010 with his husband, the stories of local residents killed by the Nazis were a chilling reminder of past atrocities – but none more so than when the organiser mentioned Manfred Hirsch, a young boy who was deported at the age of four from the house at No 18.“That’s our house,” Spitzenberger said, with a sharp intake of breath.Monuments of remembrance are ubiquitous in Berlin. The city has at least 20 memorials to victims of the Holocaust – most notably Peter Eisenman’s vast 19,000-sq metre Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe.But the memorial envisioned for Hirsch is different. Just under 10 sq cm, it might be easy to miss: a small brass stone, embedded directly underfoot, in the cobblestones of the street.Known as “Stolpersteine”, or “stumbling stones”, there are now more than 70,000 such memorial blocks laid in more than 1,200 cities and towns across Europe and Russia. Each commemorates a victim outside their last-known freely chosen residence.The stones represent a new vision of urban remembrance. If Eisenman’s large monument, set in the governmental heart of Berlin, emphasises the scale and political culpability of the Holocaust, the Stolpersteine focus on its inidual tragedies.The inscription on each stone begins “Here lived”, followed by the victim’s name, date of birth, and fate: internment, suicide, exile or, in the vast majority of cases, deportation and murder.Together, the Stolpersteine now constitute the largest decentralised monument in the world.“I find it much more moving than these colossal or labyrinthine memorials, which to me feel quite bombastic and anonymous,” says Marion Papi, a translator and writer who also lives a few doors down from Spitzenberger on Duisburger Strasse. “The Stolpersteine are so much more vivid and personal.”The idea was first conceived by artist Gunter Demnig in Cologne in 1992 as part of an initiative commemorating Roma and Sinti victims of the Holocaust. He installed the first Berlin Stolperstein four years later.He has now laid over 70,000 stones, personally overseeing the wording and installation of each one. The task keeps him on the road for 300 days a year.“A person is only forgotten when his or her name is forgotten,” he often says, citing the Talmud.Today, the Stolpersteine exist in 20 languages and 24 countries. In 2017, the Pestalozzi school in Buenos Aires became the first site outside Europe to host one, honouring hundreds of German Jewish children who found refuge there in exile.Unlike some other memorials that focus on specific persecuted groups, the Stolpersteine honour all victims of the Nazi regime, including Jewish, Sinti, Roma, disabled, dissident, and Afro-German and “asocial” citizens. The 70,000th Stolperstein was laid for Willy Zimmerer, a German man with learning disabilities murdered at Hadamar psychiatric hospital outside of Frankfurt.Despite its vast and international scope, the Stolpersteine remain a grassroots initiative. Local groups – often residents of a particular street, or schoolchildren working on a project – come together to research the biographies of local victims, and to raise the €120 it costs to install each stone.On Duisburger Strasse, Norbert and Astrid Wollschäger invited everyone in their apartment building to join in. About half agreed.“We would go in pairs to the archives,” says Wollschläger. “It really knocks it out of you.” The Nazis kept meticulous records, he says. “Right down to the last silver spoon a victim left behind.”Though emotionally exhausting, the project bonded the Wollschlägers closer to their neighbours. “We met regularly and talked about our progress. It made our building feel like a community.”Before they proceed, organisers must track down as many of the victim’s relatives as they can to ask for their approval, and to invite them to the installation ceremony. Dietmar Schewe, 67, a retired school principal, welcomed 25 visitors from Israel to the ceremony before his building.“The apartments still have many of their original features, so the guests could really imagine ‘my great grandmother held this door handle’,” Schewe says. “It felt like a small but important encounter with the lived environment of their relatives.”Not everyone is convinced by the Stolpersteine. Charlotte Knobloch, head of the Jewish community in Munich and Bavaria, has strongly opposed the project. Knobloch, who survived the Holocaust in hiding with a Christian family, finds the placement of Stolpersteine underfoot to be unacceptable.“It is my firm belief that we need to do everything we can in order to make sure that remembrance preserves the dignity of the victims,” she has said.“For me, stumbling over a piece of metal in the ground is anything but dignified.”For Michael Friedrichs-Friedländer, 69, the craftsman who makes each Stolperstein, criticism of the project is unwarranted. “I can’t think of a better form of remembrance,” he says. “If you want to read the stone, you must bow before the victim.”Friedrichs-Friedländer has inscribed every single Stolperstein since 2005, when the growing scale of the project meant Demnig no longer had time both to make and install the stones.In his small garage in the north-eastern suburbs of Berlin, Friedrichs-Friedländer engraves each stone by hand, letter by letter, with a hammer and hand-held metal stamps. He works mostly alone and in silence, six days and at least 50 hours a week. In total, he has inscribed more than 63,000 Stolpersteine.Despite several proposals to mechanise the process, Friedrichs-Friedländer insists it remain manual. “To show respect for the victims, it must be done by hand,” he says during a brief cigarette break. “The Holocaust was so systematic. What they invented as means of mass slaughter, it was more or less automatised. We don’t want anything like that.”The work can be devastating, such as the time he inscribed 34 Stolpersteine to be placed outside a former Jewish orphanage in Hamburg. But Friedrichs-Friedländer feels compelled to continue by what he sees as a moral and political imperative, all the more so in face of an ascendant far-right in Germany and across Europe.“I feel responsibility,” says Friedrichs-Friedländer. “When you know the history and see what’s happening today, there’s just so many parallels.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492d899deb207c19d6e090e0f560c8f3d59e049f/164_0_1798_1080/master/1798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8be95dfcdd9580d6ec53e4d3d672b66","title":"black panther oscar feminist film wakanda","story":"The film has been praised for its strong women, but Wakanda, its imagined African country, is a patriarchal monarchyNext Sunday, Marvel’s Black Panther will compete for the best picture award at the Oscars. If it wins, it will not only be a first-time victory for a superhero movie, it will also be the first time a film that celebrates black culture will take the award. After all, unlike the few black films previously nominated, Black Panther is not a story about black suffering – it is a salute to black people’s rich cultural heritage.These cultural elements are what I enjoyed most about the film: the music, the markets, the food, the aesthetics, the mythology and philosophy, the dance and communal vibrancy. I’m rooting for all this to lead to an Academy Award.But one trophy Black Panther does not deserve is a black feminist one, though this is the honour an astonishing amount of commentators have bestowed since its release last year. It was lauded as a “black feminist triumph” and “the most feminist superhero movie yet”. Arguing that it deserves the best picture award, Los Angeles magazine last week lauded its “depiction of female empowerment”. Even the feminist Ms magazine listed Black Panther as one of its top 15 feminist films of 2018.Sure, the female characters – Nakia, Okoye, Shuri and Ramonda, who play the powerful roles of undercover spy, head of an all-female army, head of a futuristic technology department and queen mother, respectively – are all unique dynamos. Moreover, they all have a mutually respectful relationship with the Black Panther, their king. Needless to say, they are all beautiful, intelligent and powerful black women a trinity of qualities black women are too seldom afforded on mainstream screens.But do these qualities in themselves make the film feminist? Not quite, and here’s why.The most obvious reason is that Wakanda, the fictional African country where Black Panther takes place, is a patriarchy. In other words, it is a country where men hold power and where society is organised along male lineage. Feminism, last time I checked, seeks to end patriarchy – yet the women of Wakanda seem mostly happy to support it.Second, Wakanda is a deeply traditionalist country, and tradition is, in my view, one of the biggest obstacles to women’s liberation in Africa. Just as in real life, in Black Panther the normalisation of oppression through tradition is often subtle. But throughout the film, there are scenes where tradition trumps whatever feminism is present: for example, following T’Challa’s resuscitation by M’baku, when the four women are obediently sent away so that the men can “unsentimentally” talk about serious issues. Or when, during a fight between the potential kings, Shuri complains about her corset – a jarring symbol of women’s oppression – being too tight.In addition, Wakanda is a monarchy, which means that whatever rights the female characters have are handed to them by their king. If Erik Killmonger had succeeded in his bid to be king, the women of Wakanda would be ruled by a psychopathic leader and have little power to do anything about it. “The hereditary right to rule,” as Teju Cole writes in an essay about the film, is “as ideas go, somewhere between eugenics and phrenology”. Indeed, monarchies are especially troubling when you consider the atrocities women have faced at the hands of African monarchs for centuries. I’m thinking, for example, of Samory Touré, who became the Mali empire’s leader in the late 19th century, and who killed his own daughters because they flirted with a palace page.But the most important reason Black Panther is not a feminist film is because the female characters are denied complexity. The women of Wakanda are literally picture-perfect. They are goddesses, as powerful, sexy, fearless women, always prepared to give therapeutic, balsamic words of wisdom to their king, who in turn goes through a complex range of emotions. There are three predominant stereotypes of African women in popular culture – “the struggler”, “the survivor” and “The super-empowered African woman” – that all serve to perpetuate a simplistic view of the continent. Nakia, Okoye, Shuri and Ramonda could hardly fit the third stereotype better. They are flawlessly irreproachable.The point here is not to quell a perfectly recognisable desire to escape into a fantasy world for a couple of hours, especially when the multi-million fantasy world was previously so white. But just because mainstream culture is devoid of black feminist films, it doesn’t mean we should slap the feminist label on to every little spectacle we’re given. You can tell the difference when you watch a true feminist story such as The Colour Purple, which was also an international success, where the complexity and human sensibility of the female characters is rich and multidimensional.We are at a strange point in our culture where it is considered more progressive to encourage institutions such as Hollywood to offer people of colour problematic roles that they were previously denied, rather than to envision new roles that can empower everyone. I am not interested in a black feminism that is based on black women being able to perform the same patriarchal representations that other groups have perfected.I continue to believe that black feminism is about rejecting these systems and instead envisioning new ways of existing where black women can fearlessly thrive. If we don’t, we end up with yet another story of women giving up their purpose – because, of course, a king must have his way.• Minna Salami is a feminist writer and founder of the MsAfropolitan blog"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/176ee1c2f81db2cb9c4f1ccf6e7b2cd1e4f07c53/0_0_4142_2486/master/4142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d08bf2121685e17752c66fc841d92b6","title":"brexit nationalism britain overseas aid budget","story":"That might have been the case when we met 18 months ago – it’s not now. The political consensus on aid, which has lasted two decades and led to Britain becoming a world leader in aid and development, has fallen apart.The current international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, delivered a presentation proposing a series of radical changes to the way Britain delivers aid, and how much we spend on it. She floated the idea that not all of the money should come from taxpayers (some could come from companies or philanthropists, she said), and proposed spending some of the department’s budget on peacekeeping. In other words, aid money would be spent on deploying British troops. Mordaunt is not the only Conservative with the aid budget in their sights. Jacob Rees-Mogg has long campaigned for it to be slashed, while the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has renewed his call to scrap the Department for International Development (DfID) and bring aid and development funding back into the Foreign Office, two decades after the Labour government spun it off.It’s notable that aid’s biggest critics are also Brexiteers – and not just in parliament. The most prominent outriders for a cut to the aid budget – newspapers such as the Sun, Daily Mail and the Express, and opaque lobby groups such as the TaxPayers’ Alliance and the Institute of Economic Affairs – are also Brexit’s loudest cheerleaders. That’s no coincidence: a form of nationalism, particularly the idea of a generous Britain being taken for a ride by foreigners, fuels both campaigns.It was a target that David Cameron was determined to keep - it formed a key part of David Cameron’s early modernisation agenda. Alongside an apparent commitment to combat climate change, the promise on aid was a symbol of change within the Conservative party. Even after the financial crash, as the Conservatives dropped their commitment to matching Labour’s spending and introduced an era of austerity, aid spending, like the NHS budget, was ringfenced.But perhaps the bigger problem for the aid industry is the aid industry itself. Since the sexual exploitation scandal at Oxfam, which then spread into a wider debate including harassment at Save the Children, Britain’s largest NGOs have been wary of sticking their heads above the parapet. NGOs have also faced criticism, particularly from many of their own experts, that too many campaigns are fronted by celebrities, focus on the most heartbreaking stories and make too little effort to talk about long-term structural aid.Yet what none of those who propose scrapping DfID or reducing its budget like to acknowledge is that it’s actually very good at spending money. It ranks third in the annual Aid Transparency Index, and among international aid experts has one of the best reputations in the world. A report published this month by the One campaign also praised DfID for its effectiveness, transparency and focus on poverty. In short, DfID is working.Would the Foreign Office be any better? Based on the current evidence, no. In recent years, portions of the aid budget have been parcelled out to other departments, including the Foreign Office. All of them, according to the One campaign report, struggle to spend them well. And the Foreign Office? Nearly at the bottom of the pile, just above the Home Office.The greatest irony is that those leading the campaign to undermine Britain’s aid effort are also those who like to loudly trumpet the idea of “global Britain”.

There is still no visibility on a deal, and no clarity on a no deal. There is no parliament that seems to have a grasp on managing the slide into the unknown, other than humiliating the prime minister in vote after vote and then proposing little as an alternative. The scene outside parliament is a collection of Brexit doomsday soothsayers and naysayers, each with chants and flags and signs and regalia. Elsewhere, stranger things are happening: pro-remain campaigners have started stripping off, we are arguing about Winston Churchill and Boer War concentration camps, and children are marching in the streets chanting: “Fuck Theresa May.” It feels like the last days in the compound of a cult that once flourished but is now finally and fatally besieged.The end of such a cult, that operates outside the bounds of common sense, is inevitable. Not only that, it should be welcomed. It is time. It is time for the country to come to terms with the fact that it has for too long been in denial about some of its fundamental flaws – and if a messy unplanned Brexit is the way to do that, then so be it.These past few weeks are proof that Brexit, maybe even a hard Brexit, is now looking more likely. Yet, counterintuitively, it also looks like it is necessary. The country is paralysed and polarised ahead of next month’s deadline in a fever of predictions, lies and anticipations that will only break when the reality bites. But already Brexit has kicked off important discussions about Britain that we were otherwise probably never going to have.If it appears that all we have been doing over the past two years is talking in circles about a backstop, or a meaningful vote, then think again. Brexit has revealed an unaddressed xenophobia – and the immigration system that stoked it – on the right and the left. You hear much less of Britain being a tolerant nation and a soft touch for migrants, now that the Home Office has been exposed by Brexit as it sends threatening letters of deportation to EU citizens who have lived in the country for decades. It has been an education.It has laid bare our political class, squirming pathetically and uselessly under the micro-scrutiny of Brexit. To paraphrase Jeff Bezos, Brexit rolled over the log and we saw what crawled out. The cavalier incompetence of David Davis, the dissimulating of Boris Johnson, the utter pointlessness of Michael Gove, the existence of Jacob Rees-Mogg and the dishonest and regressive elitism he represents. We have seen ministers entrusted with the future of the country learn on the job, and then flee the scene – revealing Westminster in general, and the Tories in particular, as a Ponzi scheme, a confidence trick. We now realise that the business of serious politics in this country rewards those whose only skill is keeping up the appearance of having a skill.The referendum aftermath has exposed an exceptionalism verging on delusion. It is no coincidence that Churchill’s legacy has become a matter of public debate. It is an argument that reflects Britain’s inner turmoil on whether it is uniquely apart from the rest of the world, or cannot thrive on its own. It is a soul-searching, long-overdue questioning of the conventional account of Britain’s history. Is the country especially endowed with that historical grit and determination that helped to vanquish its enemies in two world wars and run an empire or is it a country that ran that empire by means of brutality, and only won those wars as part of an alliance? Can we go it alone? Did we ever? Are we, as the heavily memed That Mitchell and Webb Look quote goes, the baddies?On this, the academic Paul Gilroy pointed out to me that it is, ironically, Britain’s global profile that has diminished its ability to focus on internal nation-building. “The British state is a machine for running and exploring the world,” he said. “It doesn’t work very well when it comes to the business of the modern nation.”Also finally exposed is the unbridgeable gap, both economic and cultural, between centre and peripheries, between the winners and the losers. There is a double nihilism about Brexit. There are many who feel like they have nothing to lose from a no-deal scenario, while also savouring the prospect of trouble ahead. This is what happens when a country is fed a diet of crisis as glamorous film reel. You cannot fight this appetite for martyrdom with technical arguments about processing times at Dover: these perverse fantasies can only be vanquished by an actual crisis.And that is why the Brexit reckoning must happen. A humbling must come to pass. From the beginning, Brexit created its own momentum. Once the question was asked – in or out? – all the grievances, justified or not, could be projected on it, with “in” being widely seen as a vote for the status quo. Within this frame, nothing else matters – not economic predictions, not warnings about medicines running out, nor threats of the need to stockpile foods. The remain campaign could not have done anything differently: it lost the moment the question was asked.And so, maybe, in the end, we will finally believe that immigration is necessary for an economy and an NHS to function, that the inequality between the south-east and the rest of Britain is unsustainable, that our political class is over-pedigreed and under-principled. We might even believe that other crises, such as climate change, are real, too.Maybe, in the end, the country outside Europe will find its stride by confronting its issues rather than blaming them on others, and forging its own way. But there is only one way to find out. What a shame Brexit is that path – but better to have a path than none at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89953d5609b74e455cef15f58e1c36d426740e41/0_305_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c02d580ca483b29f7766da59b42efb27","title":"israel eurovision propaganda oppression palestinians","story":"Those of us who make art and culture for a living thrive on free and open communication. So what should we do when we see culture becoming part of a political agenda? “Music unites,” says UK Eurovision entrant Michael Rice. What happens when a powerful state uses art as propaganda, to distract from its immoral and illegal behaviour? Everybody involved in the Eurovision song contest this year should understand that this is what is happening.European broadcasters, including the BBC, are pushing ahead with plans to hold the contest in Tel Aviv this May, as if broadcasting a hugely expensive entertainment spectacle from an actively repressive apartheid-like state is no problem at all. Eurovision, says the European Broadcasting Union, is a “nonpolitical” event. It’s impossible to reconcile what the EBU is saying with reality. Israel is a state that sees culture as a political instrument: its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, praised Netta Barzilai, Israel’s 2018 Eurovision winner, as someone who has done “exceptional foreign relations work”.Then there’s Israel’s war against the Palestinians and their culture. In March and April last year, Israel’s snipers targeted and killed journalists who were filming the peaceful protests in Gaza. In August its F16 jets destroyed the Said al-Mishal Centre in Gaza, a place of music, theatre and dance. Palestinian artists, actors and musicians are routinely denied permission to travel by the Israeli occupation authorities, or, as in the case of the poet Dareen Tatour, imprisoned for “inciting terrorism”. Meanwhile the Israeli culture minister accuses dissident Israeli cultural organisations of subversion, and threatens to cut funding unless they modify their programmes to suit government tastes. In 2017, for instance, the Acre theatre festival withdrew a play about Palestinian prisoners of Israel rather than face the minister’s financial revenge since then galleries and film festivals have been similarly menaced.These threats to cultural production are part of a wider pattern that undermines the claim that Eurovision 2019 will embody values of inclusion, ersity and friendship. The EBU’s code of ethics promotes Eurovision as a safe space, where “human rights, freedom of expression, democracy, cultural ersity, tolerance and solidarity” can thrive. If that is really the intention, having Israel as the host is absurd: the briefest inquiry would show broadcasters that these principles had long been abandoned there.Reporters Without Borders notes that Israeli journalists are subject to “military censorship” – gag orders. And as for “inclusion” – Israel’s myriad restrictions on the movement of Palestinians will ensure that almost all of them are excluded from the Eurovision festivities.Last year Israel’s acclaimed theatre actor-director, Itay Tiran, was moved to urge international support for the growing Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, called for by Palestinian civil society and tens of thousands of people across Europe, fans and musicians, have signalled that they will be campaigning to disengage their countries from the events in Tel Aviv. I understand Rice’s joy at being selected as Britain’s Eurovision representative. But when he believes “it’s not my place to say” whether Israeli treatment of the Palestinians means Eurovision should be relocated, I think he’s underestimating his power. He could help to ensure that Eurovision 2019 will be remembered as an occasion of principled protest, not another episode of cultural whitewashing.• Brian Eno is a musician, composer, producer and visual artist.

Possible variants of a deposit return scheme include cash rewards for returning drinks containers without an upfront deposit.Gove said the proposals would help Britain become less of a “throwaway” society.“Through our plans, we will introduce a world-leading tax to boost recycled content in plastic packaging, make producers foot the bill for handling their packaging waste and end the confusion over household recycling,” he said.“We are committed to cementing our place as a world leader in resource efficiency, so we can be the first generation to leave our environment in a better state than we inherited it.”Julian Kirby, the lead plastics campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said a deposit return scheme is long overdue and “must cover all containers, not just small ones”.“These proposals are welcome steps forward, but bigger strides are needed if we are truly going to deal with the consequences of our throwaway society,” he added.Samantha Harding, the litter programme director at the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said it was important all bottles and cans were included in the deposit return scheme.“By introducing a deposit system that accepts and collects every single can and bottle, Michael Gove has a golden opportunity to end growing scepticism around current recycling methods, by boosting recycling rates of drinks cans and bottles to near perfection,” she said.“This would make such a difference to the health of our environment and relieve struggling local councils of the huge financial burden of waste management, by making those who produce these vast amounts of packaging rightfully liable for the costs of dealing with it.”Sam Chetan-Welsh, a Greenpeace UK political adviser, said: “A ‘catch-all’ deposit return scheme could be a turning point in Britain’s efforts to curb plastic pollution, but it’s crucial that ministers get it right.“A half-baked scheme limited to smaller bottles will simply confuse customers and fail to capture millions of larger plastic containers, many of which could still end up buried in landfill, burnt in incinerators or polluting our oceans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46e4e9085ab58b44e221b64abfad882285db152c/0_34_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66d0c12d7b83e8a7a25fdb4a2886a8d2","title":"michael gove food waste bins weekly","story":"Drive to ‘reduce, reuse, recycle and cut waste’ could include plastic tax and deposit schemeMillions of homes could have their food waste bins collected weekly, if new proposals from the environment secretary are implemented in the wake of a government consultation on the UK’s waste system.Michael Gove’s proposed measures to ensure consistent recycling collections come after a number of councils cut the frequency of collections, leaving residents with overflowing bins.Free garden waste collections for households with gardens may also be introduced while councils in England will be obliged to provide weekly pickups of food waste. The policy area is devolved to national government level.“We are committed to going further and faster to reduce, reuse, recycle and cut waste,” Gove said. “That’s why we are leading the way to move away from being a ‘throwaway’ society and drive up domestic recycling. We are committed to cementing our place as a world leader in resource efficiency, so we can be the first generation to leave our environment in a better state than we inherited it.”Local authorities would receive more money from the government to pay for the increased frequency of collections, many of which are outsourced to private companies. The services were reduced variously from once every one or two weeks to every three or four weeks after deep cuts to council budgets.This led to reports of overflowing food waste, which attracted insects and rats. Government figures showed that complaints about missed collections had increased by a third across England and Wales since 2014.Councils received more than 1.8m such complaints, about 4,500 a day, the BBC reported, with the actual number of missed collections likely to be much higher.The issue is particularly acute in parts of Surrey, Sussex and the West Midlands, where refuse workers in Birmingham have been striking over a longstanding industrial dispute. Fortnightly collections are set to temporarily resume there.Spending on waste collection by local authorities fell from £1bn in 2010-11 to £888m in 2017-18 after accounting for inflation.The consultation will also look at bringing in a deposit return scheme for cans and bottles. The scheme, whereby people would pay a small upfront charge refundable upon return of the empty container, could drive up the recycling of the estimated 3bn plastic bottles that are currently incinerated, sent to landfill or discarded on streets.Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said: “Plastic packaging makes up two-thirds of all the plastic waste that pollutes this country and wreaks havoc on our environment. It’s our responsibility to do something about it, and that’s why we will introduce a new tax on the producers of plastic packaging that don’t use enough recycled material.”The changes are a central plank of the government’s upcoming environment bill, which will be introduced early in the second session of parliament after Easter.Environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth welcomed the proposals, but said bigger steps were needed. “A radical overhaul of waste strategy is urgently needed to deal with our waste crisis – but this must include bold targets to substantially cut the waste that squanders precious resources, blights our environment and harms our wildlife,” Julian Kirby, a plastics campaigner at Friends of the Earth said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e0791abd4dfc3836cc8d96304a6fa2e16f2067/0_37_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45333e55e8532c3a116d1b10d4a030bd","title":"tell us about the outfit you loved wearing the most","story":"We’d like you to send in photos of your favourite ‘look’ and share your memories of when you wore itThe clothes we choose to wear can impact our mood, and leave a lasting impression on our memories.

Those insane skinny cigarette pants and shirt, the white Chelsea boots, the inconceivably massive hair. I immediately copied almost everything about it with no shame.It is one of my most formative experiences as a designer. It struck a match for me, the way it pulled things from history, but created something super-modern. Even though it is in some ways carefully considered, there remains something so immediate about it. It speaks to everything I like about fashion as a means of self-expression. It’s lofty and it’s kind of contrived, but it’s really alive. I love that.At the start of my career I was interested in the idea that what I wore would become part of my performance. This dress sprang from that. I approached the designer Petra Storrs in 2008 with the idea that I wanted the audience to see themselves reflected in me, just as the songs I was writing about my personal life reflected their lives. It feels like a really important outfit because at the time I was performing in small clubs by night and auditioning for acting roles by day. It became a dress people remembered me by, “the girl in the mirror dress”.I enjoy clothes that make statements rather than just look nice. I’ve kept everything of any significance I have ever worn. The mirror dress is now stored safely in two pieces in my loft. I am hoping my kid – or kids if I have more – will have fun with it in the future.I was 18 and had just started at Vogue when I picked up a wastepaper basket and tied a huge taffeta bow round it to wear to a fashion show. It was the early 80s and before I even started working as a stylist. I was swept away by the avant garde aesthetic of Yohji Yamamoto and Comme des Garçons this was a homage. My mother used to say, “Try things out”, so I made most of my clothes from materials I found lying around at home. This particular creation was incredibly uncomfortable but when I went to the cloakroom to take it off, it had left imprints around my forehead, so I couldn’t.I think back to how oddly brave I was. But passion overrode the self-consciousness I might otherwise have felt. I was trying to find my look, experimenting in pursuit of my style DNA. As for my hat, it returned to its former glory as a wastepaper basket.I have always been obsessed by the power of words. As a furious and disillusioned teenager, I chose them carefully to use as weapons against my adversaries. One or two can convey so much.I designed my Ginsberg is God jumper in 2002. I was making a short film with John Malkovich, called Hideous Man, about beatnik girls waiting at a club for their favourite poet to arrive for a reading. I wanted the leader of the group to wear a jumper showing her devotion to literature and art, like a band T-shirt. “Ginsberg is God” is funny, because what does it mean? Who is Ginsberg? It can mean everything and nothing.Everything changed when Kate Moss wore it – it became a thing. It’s part of my identity now. I have lots from over the years and I feel like a worker when I’m wearing my Ginsberg.A pivotal outfit for me would be two suits I had made while I was still living in Nottingham. I had three and a half metres of pale mint green and dusty pink gabardine, and had a suit made from each. The unusual colours were unique and an early indicator of my interest in tailoring. I wore the double-breasted green one with very soft, green handmade leather boots from the Chelsea Cobbler and the single-breasted pink one with burgundy patent leather boots from Camden Market.It was a bold move at that time. Nobody my age was buying bespoke suits – it was something your parents or grandparents did. Young people all over the world were expressing themselves in different ways, such as the 1968 Paris riots. For me, those suits represented something inidual.This photo was taken in 1985 by Robyn Beeche and I’m wearing a piece from my AW81 collection, RenaissanceGold. My look – including colourful makeup by Yvonne Gold and bright hair – has been a significant part of what makes me who I am and people recognise me for that as much as my designs. The jacket was part of my pleated crinoline collection. It’s a look that’s become a signature of my brand – for AW18 and SS19, I designed pleated dresses and jumpsuits using swirls and structured shoulders that fan out beautifully.Pieces from the original collection are still relevant. They will be featured in this year’s Met exhibition Camp: Notes on Fashion. And I was asked to recreate the pleated tops I originally designed in 1973, worn by Freddie Mercury and Brian May, for the film Bohemian Rhapsody.I wore a blue blazer with African print sleeves to do my Live At The Apollo comedy show in 2016. It cemented a new look for me at a new time in my life. It was by Stuzo Clothing, a non-gender specific clothing brand run by an amazing gay couple. Wearing it was when I became totally comfortable saying, “I’m out, I’m proud and I’m comfortable in my skin.” I cut my hair short and natural, and I started wearing glasses, too. Now I’ve got about 80 pairs.When I was younger I used to wear my hair long to try to fit into what femininity was supposed to look like – even though my comedy has never been like that. Back then I cared what people thought. With age and experience, I’ve got to the point where I don’t give a fuck – I’ll wear what I like, take it or leave it.

She was the exception to the rule. I didn’t have any trans role models but when I knew I wanted to transition, around the age of 19, Isis King was on America’s Next Top Model. She was the first trans woman I could relate to. Then, when I was 26 and a few years into my transition, Laverne Cox and Janet Mock came out, and all of these amazing women started sharing their stories. It made me feel a lot less alone.I became an activist by accident. I got booked on a job for Uniqlo in 2016 – my first big campaign – and they wanted me to speak about my experience of being transgender and black in Britain. I hadn’t come across that before I had always just been cast as the token trans model. That opened my eyes to how I could use this platform to make change happen.My experience with L’Oréal in 2017 taught me to be more mindful of the companies I become involved with. It was a ersity campaign that used my appearance but didn’t allow me my voice, and I was dropped after making comments about systemic racism on social media. Even so, it’s hard for me to say I wouldn’t do it again. What came out of it has been greater than what it was intended to be in the first place.It’s also important to have a dialogue with people who might oppose your views, as I did with Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain. It’s not really about him, it’s about the viewers and getting them to think, and exposing a different point of view. If you’re only speaking to people who think the same as you, you are just existing in an echo chamber.I remember when you could just enjoy images or music and not know what the model or pop star’s political beliefs were – but that is not the way we work now. It’s a good thing people want to know what their money is going towards and who they’re investing in. Just look at Naomi Campbell: she’s been hugely vocal about the rights of black people and being a dark-skinned model. She’s paved the way for so many black models. Even if you don’t want to use your voice, you can still use your platform and your privilege. It’s a waste if you don’t.I always say that if you can’t see it, you can be it – but it’s 10 times harder. The more trans models become visible and vocal, the more they become normalised in the eyes of wider society. And, of course, it is normal – we’re a super-small section of society but that doesn’t mean our rights aren’t valid or necessary. Our experience may seem a lot more “otherworldly” than it actually is, but we get up, we work, we have ambition, we have drive – probably more than most because there’s so much we’re up against."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3717ecf0b7fadbabf881d7cea29b11a4cd451d56/0_0_1020_1530/master/1020.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3790aa505ac08713b6845cbd90c75541 2020w","title":"alfonso cuaron roma and the oscars why has hollywood ignored the foreign language film","story":"If Alfonso Cuarón’s film triumphs it will prompt some troubling questions for the AcademyIf, as the bookies predict, Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma triumphs at the Academy Awards, it will open a can of worms. No foreign-language film has ever won. Only two have been nominated for best picture this century (Amour and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). A win for Roma would make history. It would also bring up questions.Of course, the Oscars is Hollywood voting on its favourite movie, which means “America first”, but it’s “best picture”, right? As in “best picture in the world”, not “best picture by an American or Brit”. You could go back over the years and rank any number of foreign-language films above the best picture winner (was A Beautiful Mind better than In the Mood for Love in 2001?). You can do the same with this year’s nominees: give me Cold War and Shoplifters over Bohemian Rhapsody and Green Book any day. Or you could look at world cinema greats such as Godard, Ozu, Fellini or Bergman and ask: were none of the films they made as good as what Hollywood had to offer?The foreign language Oscar is already a messy afterthought. It was not created until the 29th Academy Awards in 1956, although special awards were given to foreign films before that. Only one entry per country is allowed, and that film must be submitted by an approved national organisation (such as Bafta for Britain), although entries don’t have to be in the national language. A shortlist of nine is created by the Academy’s special committee, which is then whittled down to five by “specially invited committees” in LA, New York and London. And then, only Academy members who have seen all five are allowed to vote on the winner.

But as far back as the 1930s, the Academy was wrestling with how best to recognise “cartoons”. Having been nominated solely for a best music score award at the 10th Academy Awards in 1938, Disney’s groundbreaking gem made a return appearance at the next Oscar ceremony, where Shirley Temple presented Walt with an honorary award (one full-size statuette and seven miniatures) for “a significant screen innovation which has charmed millions and pioneered a great new entertainment field”.Powell and Pressburger’s glittering wartime fantasia ranks among the greatest films ever made, a shimmering jewel in the crown of British cinema that deftly straddles the ide between this world and the next. Yet like David Niven’s doomed pilot, it got lost in the mist, Oscar-wise, dropping under the Academy’s radar and earning zero nominations. In the US, the film was released under the title Stairway to Heaven because the Americans apparently didn’t want to see anything with the word “death” in the title. Really.Eyebrows were raised in 2012 when Alfred Hitchcock’s sublimely weird chiller displaced Citizen Kane from the top spot of Sight \u0026amp Sound magazine’s august poll of the greatest movies ever made. Yet neither picture was considered the pinnacle of achievement by the Academy, with Citizen Kane losing out to How Green Was My Valley in 1941’s best picture race, while in 1959 Vertigo earned nominations only for art direction and sound.Stanley Kubrick’s interplanetary epic may have changed the face of modern cinema, but its Oscar triumphs were limited to a special visual effects award in 1969. Indeed, 2001 wasn’t even nominated in the best picture category, with the Academy apparently finding more merit in Romeo and Juliet Rachel, Rachel The Lion in Winter Funny Girl and top prize winner Oliver!. Kubrick was nominated for best director, but despite being regarded as one of the most important film-makers of the 20th century, like Hitchcock and Welles, he never won that award.When Jonathan Demme’s The Silence of the Lambs won best picture in 1991, it was hailed as the first horror film to take the top prize (although some would argue that it’s actually a psychological thriller with added cannibalism). Yet the big daddy of horror earned only two Oscars, for sound and adapted screenplay, losing out in the best picture category to George Roy Hill’s The Sting. Director William Friedkin had triumphed two years earlier with The French Connection, ensuring his place in the history books. But The Exorcist remains a superior work, regularly voted the scariest film ever made.The tale of a young boy whose parents have separated and who finds solace in the company of a lonely space alien, this sentimental sci-fi gem (which rivals the tear-jerking power of Silent Running) is arguably Spielberg’s most personal work. It was the highest grossing film at the time, outselling Star Wars, and stamping itself upon the hearts of all who watched in rapturous wonder. Nominated for nine Oscars, it was beaten to best picture by Gandhi, whose director, Richard Attenborough, later stated, very graciously, that ET should have won.Danny Boyle’s incendiary adaptation of Irvine Welsh’s novel is an era-defining work, a film that captured and shaped a moment of popular culture history. As such, it was exactly the kind of cutting-edge work the Academy tends to ignore. But screenwriter John Hodge earned a well-deserved nomination for turning Welsh’s scorching prose into quotable screen gold, negotiating a thin line between humour and horror. At the 69th Oscars, the best picture award went to Anthony Minghella’s The English Patient. Choose life, indeed!Lionel Shriver’s electrifying novel of maternal guilt and “bad seed” violence was brilliantly brought to the screen by Lynne Ramsay, who made her name with the acclaimed Ratcatcher and the underrated Morvern Callar and who recently directed the jaw-dropping existential thriller You Were Never Really Here. Despite picking up Bafta and Golden Globe nominations, and boasting a career-best central performance by Tilda Swinton, We Need to Talk About Kevin was entirely overlooked by the Academy voters.My favourite film of 2018, Debra Granik’s note-perfect tale of a father and daughter living off-grid in the Pacific north-west serves as yet another reminder that awards often ignore the most remarkable movies. Depressing, too, that in a year in which film-makers such as Granik, Lynne Ramsay, Chloé Zhao, Marielle Heller and Josie Rourke were all eligible, the Academy has come up with yet another all-male list of best director contenders. No matter, Leave No Trace is pretty much perfect and its omission from the nominations is Oscar’s loss."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud.

He has scored only once in the league this season – in October – and once more in the FA Cup fourth-round win at Arsenal. He scored only three times for United in the second half of last season and his touch and confidence are a continuing problem.Yet asked if the forward’s best days are behind him, Solskjær said: “He’s still a young boy. He’s a man of 30, but he can still play for many, many years. He’s been here for a year, I’ve been here for two months with him and he’s been injured for the first part of it so it’s unfair to just expect him to be at the top straight away. I’m sure we’ll see the best of him before the end of the season.With Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial out for up to three weeks apiece because of injuries suffered in the 2-0 Champions League defeat by Paris Saint-Germain, Sánchez has a chance to establish himself finally, starting with Monday’s FA Cup fifth-round tie at Chelsea.Solskjær wants Sánchez to make an immediate impact. “We need every player to perform to the best level,” he said. “We are challenging to be top four, challenging against very good teams, so you need the players to step up now and you expect that at Manchester United at the end of the season.“We always do well towards the end of the season. The players have had this little setback with the PSG game, maybe a reality check. Their pride has been hurt. I’m sure they’ll bounce back on Monday.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd342c667353fea103ba35df664fc146382356f8/0_395_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f09f161781490d6000532d6eb445235a","title":"ryan giggs wales manchester united van gaal interview","story":"The Wales manager discusses the loneliness of his job, what Manchester United should do next and why he turned to a psychologist“I think every manager feels that loneliness,” Ryan Giggs says as he identifies the usually unspoken difficulty at the core of his work. The manager of Wales since January 2018, Giggs has had nine games to get used to the isolation.“I’m lucky to have great staff around me and, during the week, you’re constantly in meetings and on the training ground. But it’s that hour before the game, when the coaches take the lads out to warm up, that you feel it. You’re alone in the dressing room and you’ve done everything you can. That’s a lonely time. There’s nothing left to do. You’re on your own.”We sit in a hotel room overlooking Old Trafford. Giggs won 13 Premier League titles and two Champions League finals as a player for Manchester United, the club with whom he was associated for 29 years from a boy to an icon who took charge as a caretaker manager for four matches in 2014. Giggs, who then became Louis van Gaal’s assistant for two seasons, finally left United in July 2016. Eighteen months later, bruised by the even more intense loneliness of looking for work in football, Giggs was appointed as manager of Wales.The 45-year-old, who still lives in Manchester, soon reflects on the rise of Ole Gunnar Solskjær, his former teammate, who has had such success in the Premier League since replacing José Mourinho and becoming interim manager at United. But Giggs concentrates first on Wales.Last September, in his first home game, Wales produced a vibrant display of the attacking football Giggs epitomised as a player. They swaggered past the Republic of Ireland, winning 4-1 in an exhilarating and clinical performance. Yet, in their most recent match, Wales lost to Albania, 42 places below them in the world rankings. Unlike a club manager Giggs has had to reflect on that loss for nearly three months.Statistics can be misleading but, under Giggs, Wales have lost five of nine games. “If we’d have beaten Albania, I would have called it a successful year,” Giggs says. “But we played Spain, Uruguay, Mexico. Denmark twice. Almost all in the world’s top 10. We used experimental squads, experimental systems. So we’ve used this first year to see what we’ve got while looking forward to the Euros. Against Albania we actually played really well first half. We should have won 3-0 but missed easy chances. Then they get a penalty which may not have been one. But sometimes you learn a lot more from defeats.”A crunch period is looming. On 24 March Wales face Slovakia in Cardiff. It is their opening match in a qualifying group that includes the World Cup finalists Croatia as well as Hungary, Belarus and Azerbaijan. “We need a good start against our main rivals because, after Croatia, I would say it could be between us and Slovakia. They have a new manager but they’ve got talented players. Marek Hamsik stands out. He just broke the goalscoring record for Napoli, overtaking Diego Maradona. So this first game against Slovakia is a big one.”Old Trafford does not cast any shadows on a rainy day. But it’s hard to escape the club that has dominated Giggs’s life. He joined United on his 14th birthday and played his last game aged 40. Giggs admits he shed tears in his car after his retirement was confirmed following the final match he was in charge of United as caretaker manager – against Southampton in May 2014. “I’d had three weeks in the job and I put myself under so much pressure. I felt the players had given a lot and my own playing career was over. It was also not knowing what was next. So when I got in the car all my emotion came out.”He is much more relaxed now. During a morning in which he runs a session with young men from the Laureus-supported Street League programme, which uses football to help people get back into employment and education, Giggs is impressive. As a Laureus academy member he is an engaging communicator – whether encouraging the men to stay true to themselves or answering their questions. When asked to name the best player he faced he helps the group feel as if they are in the tunnel next to an imposing Zinedine Zidane – and out on the pitch as he describes the Frenchman’s strength and balletic skills. But he always comes back to them and tries to boost their self-belief.Giggs explains that, after leaving United, he needed the help of a psychologist to restructure his life. “It helped fill the gaps of what I was going to do day-to-day. From leaving school, until 42, I’d done the same thing every day. So it was more the structure and preparing myself for life away from United – rather than any mental issues. It was trying to find something to help me get through the day, the week, the month, the year. If you’re finishing the same thing you’ve done for 25 years, it’s quite scary. But I soon realised there’s a life outside football, I had a good 18 months travelling, doing TV work, spending more time with the kids.”Until United were, in Solskjær’s words, given a “reality check” with their 2-0 home defeat by PSG in the Champions League this past week, there had been a resurgence at Old Trafford. After the moribund rule of Mourinho, surely part of Giggs must wish he could have been the former player to galvanise his old club? “No, not really. It might have been different if I wasn’t the Welsh coach. Ole’s done a fantastic job. I’ve obviously been in touch with him and he’s given players freedom and also done well tactically. The confidence is huge. He’s got smiles back on their faces.”This interview takes place before the game against PSG and Giggs does warn of “bumps in the road”. But when they played together, did Solskjær appear to have managerial potential? “Yeah, he did. He’s got that steely determination, because he’s been through a lot. When he was young he went to a different country. He had huge success but he was not always picked. He studied the game while he had a bad injury and then he coached at the club. So I always thought he had that potential because he knows the game and has that inner steel.”Does Giggs believe Solskjær should become United’s permanent manager? “I do. We’ve messed around far too long. When you’ve got someone who knows the club, who is tactically astute, clearly has the players and fans on board, that gives you lots of momentum. There will be bumps in the road but most fans imagine what he could do with the money that’s been spent the last few years.”It sounds as if Giggs would like Solskjær’s appointment to be made immediately? “I wouldn’t be in any rush because you don’t want to derail the current situation. Planning is more important than the announcement. Look at Guardiola. He got in Man City players he wanted the year before he took over. So, if it is Ole, keep it amongst the club and start planning. Our problem the past few years is that we were always playing catch-up. We should identify the two or three players we need if we’re going to win the Premier League and Champions League.”Giggs struggled, understandably, after being out of work so long. “I don’t think young coaches in the UK get enough chances. You’ve seen Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard do well but there was a cycle of the same people getting the same jobs. There is also the culture where, three months into the season, a manager is fired. How do you appoint a young coach, who’s not got any experience, to a struggling side? I understand but it’s like young players – you never know what they’re capable of until you give them the chance. I believe ex-players who have prepared themselves well should be given a chance.“When I went for the Swansea job it was difficult. I felt that everything went well but it was the manner of finding out – on Sky Sports – I hadn’t got the job. That’s not the way to treat people.“I did get disheartened because I was out for 18 months and the longer it goes on, the more you think you’re never going to get back in.The loneliness of management seems a distant problem now, particularly after a morning when Giggs was besieged with requests for selfies. “It’s still the same,” he says with a smile. “The only difference is, rather than the kids, it’s mums and dads asking for a selfie. The kids look at the photo and say: ‘Who’s this?’ or: ‘You used to play for United, right?’ I also get: ‘Did you play with Ronaldo? Do you know Rashford?’ I don’t mind. I’m a manager now.”In 2018 nearly 300,000 young people around the world benefited from 160 Laureus Sport for Good-supported programmes in 40 countries, working to end violence, discrimination and disadvantage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e29d0a62e53f3c92208e360f6be5b37be268bfb/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6e1c0de23d1d0d1ba01e6d696003f94","title":"fa cup fifth round 10 talking points from weekend action","story":"Imperilled Millwall deliver a breath of fresh air, Yves Bissouma shines and Wolves’ old boys offer a platform for the revampIt will not be easy for Millwall to balance their priorities after reaching yet another FA Cup quarter‑final. Neil Harris always treats the competition with maximum respect and Millwall’s manager was a proud man after watching his team cruise to a professional 1-0 win over AFC Wimbledon at Kingsmeadow – but the south London side cannot afford to let their impressive Cup run affect their league form. Millwall are two points above the Championship’s bottom three and the challenge for Harris will be making sure his players are in the right frame of mind for Wednesday’s league game at Derby. That said, these are exciting times and Harris did grant himself the indulgence of thinking about the quarter-final draw. “We will avoid Man City if we can,” he said. “To be at the Den, 20,000 of our fans to see a Cup quarter, is what I want.” Jacob SteinbergWith every match the £14m or thereabouts that Brighton spent last summer on Yves Bissouma looks shrewder. The 22-year-old Mali midfielder, signed from Lille, was the best player on the pitch as he helped Chris Hughton’s team dispose of Derby on Saturday and advance to the FA Cup quarter‑finals. His delicate touches and strong, skilful running gives Brighton a dimension that should also help them climb out of trouble in the Premier League. “He brings something different to our midfield,” said Hughton. “It’s about developing him in the system we want to play – whether with two in midfield or three – but he’s learning all the time. For somebody of that type and ability it will always be about consistency but he’s learning all the time. He’s got the makings of a very talented player for us.” Paul DoyleHe won’t admit it in public but Frank Lampard probably won’t cry himself to sleep over Derby’s FA Cup defeat. Thanks to their progression in the EFL Cup and a replay in the last round of this competition, they have already played more games than any of their Championship rivals. Their tally is now up to 39 and will be at least 54 by the end of the season – and that’s without factoring in the possibility of play-offs. Had they won at Brighton then their league fixture against Swansea in a few weeks would have been rearranged, the games piling up and up for a team who have only two centre-backs to tide them over until the summer. Lampard’s priority is promotion and, given their most likely path to that is through the play-offs, he needs his squad as fresh as they can be for the physically and emotionally draining trials ahead. Nick MillerWhile Dan James was illuminating the Liberty Stadium with his exhilarating performance against Brentford, it was tempting to wonder what was going through the mind of Marcelo Bielsa, the Leeds manager, and everyone else at Elland Road. James, after all, had been on the verge of joining Leeds on deadline day, when Swansea initially agreed to allow the 21‑year‑old to move on loan with a view to a permanent deal. Swansea, with not everyone at the club singing from the same hymn sheet, pulled the plug on that transfer at the last minute, after realising the terms were stacked heavily – some would say ridiculously – in favour of Leeds. Realistically James is unlikely to be at Swansea next season but it is no longer a foregone conclusion he ends up at Leeds, with plenty of other clubs sure to be joining the race to sign him. SJDoncaster Rovers are in the final League One play-off berth, only a point above Peterborough in seventh, but their showing against Crystal Palace should encourage them to believe they can finish in the top six. In James Coppinger’s experience out wide, John Marquis’s muscular presence up front – 22 goals in all competitions so far – a drilled midfield and defence, and Grant McCann’s managerial smarts, Rovers have a package that impressed against Roy Hodgson’s battle-hardened side. “We like to get about teams, that’s how we approach it, but we were not going to leave anything in the changing room and we gave it a go,” said McCann. “We’ll quickly forget about this game – it was a bonus. We’re trying to build something for the future, trying to get out of this league.” Before Sunday Rovers had lost only once since late December. “We’ve been on a very good run,” McCann added. “The league’s most important for us.” It will be some surprise if Rovers are not contesting a promotion place by the end of the season. Jamie JacksonPep Guardiola is frantically searching for a player to relieve the burden on Fernandinho, as the Brazilian is the only member of the Manchester City squad who can operate in defensive midfield with any consistency. Fernandinho’s fitness, intelligence and willingness to commit a foul when required allow his teammates to roam about the pitch, knowing they can rely on the former Shakhtar Donetsk man to mop up danger. His importance is regularly made clear in the Premier League and Champions League but on the mud of Rodney Parade it was equally crucial against a physical Newport County team desperately wanting to unsettle their illustrious opponents. Fernandinho was key in ensuring that did not happen but City need to split his workload if they are to compete on all four fronts. Will UnwinBristol City showed in last season’s EFL Cup that they are an enterprising and talented team, beating Watford, Stoke, Crystal Palace and Manchester United before losing narrowly to Manchester City. But in the Championship they fell from second at Christmas to 11th at the end of the season. This time around, Lee Johnson’s side lie sixth with a game or two in hand on all the teams above them. So automatic promotion remains in reach. Against Wolves, City played nicely before the break and properly after it if they can replicate that intensity of that second period over the next three months, they have an excellent chance of promotion to the Premier League.

Instead, they missed them and lost. “We were so close but not close enough,” said Steve McClaren. “That sums us up of late.” A long‑suffering Rs fan put it more strongly. “That sums up my QPR‑supporting lifetime,” he said. QPR were in the position to fail because of Luke Freeman, the 26-year-old midfielder who created a clutch of first-half openings. His touch and vision were eye‑catching. In 2007 at 15 years and 223 days old, Freeman became the youngest player to appear in the FA Cup – coming on for Gillingham against Barnet – and it led to a move to Arsenal, although that ended in frustration. The suitors circled last summer, with Middlesbrough particularly keen. Many more performances like this and he will be in demand again.

Now, we’re being told to declutter our homes and diaries. What happened to just being ourselves?What brings you joy? It is a question that is hard to avoid these days, as joy seems to be the new buzzword. It is on the cover of two new books, The Joy of No (#Jono) by Debbie Chapman, published at the end of last year, and The Joy of Missing Out, by the philosopher and psychologist Svend Brinkmann, published earlier this month. It is also on Netflix, in the show Tidying Up with Marie Kondo, in which the decluttering guru and author tells us to discard any possessions that do not “spark joy”. Truly, a surfeit of joy!But joy is not the only idea linking these three approaches: Chapman, Brinkmann and Kondo all tap into the same zeitgeisty wish to clean up our cluttered lives. For Kondo, it is about household clutter for Chapman and Brinkmann, it is life clutter.For Chapman, life clutter builds up when we fill our lives with social events we do not really want to go to, work tasks we say yes to, when they are not our responsibility, toxic relationships and unhelpful thoughts and feelings. Just as Kondo promises to bring us joy by decluttering our homes, these books promote decluttering of a different kind – social, professional, psychological, existential – that, the authors tell us, will lead us to true fulfilment and freedom.It is no surprise to me that this is the focus of the current wave of “how can I fix my life” angst. The wish to say no instead of saying yes, to stay in instead of going out, to discard instead of to accumulate – these are all logical responses to our feelings of being overstretched, overtired and overwhelmed. Clinical psychologist Rachel Andrew says she sees this in many forms in her consulting room, with patients saying life is too stressful and too pressured, or describing themselves as detached and their lives as meaningless and unsustainable.Her patients tell her, she says, that “they cannot continue living at the pace they’re living at”, but at the same time, they cannot stop – they cannot say no. When she hears these words, Andrew begins thinking about “the core beliefs underneath people’s inability to say no”. When patients describe struggling to refuse to take on extra responsibilities at work, she says there is often an underlying fear that others will think they are not trying hard enough, an underlying fear that they are not good enough. That compulsive “yes” also forms part of a precarious solution to their self-doubt, she says, as, unconsciously: “They use this constant striving to make themselves feel better, to get that buzz from achieving things.”When patients struggle to say no to social arrangements, she says: “Sometimes that can come from a core belief of feeling, deep down, that they’re unlikable.” The roots of these beliefs are frequently buried in our past. “I often meet adults who had difficult experiences in childhood, where they felt on the outside of a social group or experienced a trauma, and they don’t want to say no due to a fear of being on the outside, that people will discover them as unlikable in some way. That can lead to this perpetual need to say yes or to keep others happy.”Maurice Mcleod, a writer and local councillor, found that his inability to say “no” caused him serious problems when he went freelance about a decade ago. He took on so many projects and agreed to do so many favours that, he says, he was living with “a constant feeling of unease and panic. Every time the phone rang, I’d think: ‘Oh my God, who’s that, what haven’t I done?’ It was this constant feeling of letting people down.” He took on so much unpaid work that he had to refuse work that was paid, got into debt, and realised the only way out was to just say “no”.He developed a series of questions in his mind to help him work out which requests to refuse, and which to accept: will it pay? How long will it take? How much attention will it require? This helped him to feel calmer and less panicked. He says, despite “the moments of awkwardness saying no – and it is still awkward – in my head, I know the benefit of not having that extra deadline looming”.But that is not to say it was simple, he cautions. “I still find it very difficult. I still get flattered when someone says they’d like me to be involved in their project, and I still find myself saying yes to things that I really shouldn’t. I’m not pretending I’ve conquered saying ‘no’.”It seems it is more complicated to experience “#Jono” than Harding suggests in her book, which is full of sentences such as: “Ditch the guilt.” Reader, at this my laughter was bitter and hollow.This is the problem with the hashtagification of this notion of saying no, of doing less, of reacting against what the psychoanalyst and fellow of the Institute of Psychoanalysis Josh Cohen calls our “manically overactive, hyper-stimulated acquisitive culture”. His book Not Working: Why We Have to Stop, is a critique of our state of perpetual busyness, a hymn in praise of doing nothing. But, he says, while he has added his voice to a “chorus of disapproval” of this culture, he has, at the same time, “a certain suspicion” of what is being created in its place. He says: “I think that once a tendency or a counter-tendency starts to trend in this way, it becomes part of the culture it wants to critique or resist. It enters the circuit of anxiety.” Inevitably, then, we begin asking ourselves, are we saying no enough? Are we missing out enough? Are we not working enough? As we strive to embrace the virtues of restraint, of doing less, of leaving space, we risk destroying that which we seek. It evaporates even as we try to articulate it, like the credibility of people who tweet about how much they are “living in the moment”.But this is nevertheless something we need to grapple with. For Brinkmann, it is not only a question of our psychological wellbeing – although it is that too. He writes that self-restraint and missing out are as vital for the global population as they are for us as iniduals because “for so long our lives have been based on overconsumption, untrammelled growth and whittling away at our natural resources”. His arguments are compelling.Imagine that you have cancelled all your unwanted plans, said no to all your groan-inducing invitations, resisted tempting purchases, turned off your TVs, phones and computers. You are missing out on absolutely everything and feeling very smug about it, too. You are, in this moment, sitting at home, on your own, doing nothing. What happens next?“All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone,” said the 17th-century French philosopher Blaise Pascal. But the solution cannot be to force ourselves to sit quietly in a room alone, because, contrary to our own omnipotent fantasies and risible delusions of self-control, we cannot choose what we feel or what we think. We have to ask, why is this such an impossible thing for us to do? Why do we persist in filling our lives, even when we do not want to? What is it that we are avoiding? Ultimately, why do we continue to do the very things that make us unhappy?Such big questions can be addressed by psychoanalysis, says Cohen, since, “uniquely to itself, it encourages us to ask questions about how we live that we are allowed to sit with, and turn over, and not feel under pressure to resolve. It asks us to be with the question rather than leap to the answer.” He also suggests taking a long walk with no destination in mind, or meeting a friend without a time limit or agenda – in other words, trying to create an expanse in your life that is not hemmed in by time, space, or purpose. “It’s all about cultivating in oneself the impulse to aimlessness,” he says.As for #Jono and #Jomo – well, for me, saying no and missing out are not where I find my joy. I find it when I am not looking for it: when I am making my friend’s children laugh, or when I feel a spontaneous surge of love for my husband, or when I am cooking dinner for my friends. Cohen says: “If you read the great poets of joy, like Rilke, they think of joy as something fleeting. There is something sad about it, because one feels its passing as one experiences it – it is not some kind of permanent aspiration, a solid state.” It is a word that loses all meaning when it is part of a hashtagged acronym.In these dysfunctional times, joy is a high bar. Perhaps we could start with trying to be honest with ourselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/413d3bc09ee3f2ca6604fad0a67640f27ceefec1/2_0_8529_5120/master/8529.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96c40afad0f67677b9303134dda0b9ff","title":"diverticulitis the debilitating bowel disorder thats weakening our guts","story":"John Slater, a former railway worker who lives in Boston, Lincolnshire, was 40 when he first went to the doctor with gut problems. Along with “colossal” lower abdominal cramps, he had started passing blood from his rectum. His doctor thought he had irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and then, when the bleeding worsened, an ulcer was suspected. It wasn’t until Slater ended up in A\u0026ampE, after 12 years of debilitating symptoms, that a colonoscopy revealed adhesions in his bowel lining. “The walls were fused together,” is how Slater puts it.The cause turned out to be a rare and extreme form of erticulosis – a complication arising from the formation of pouches in the bowel lining known as erticulitis. The presence of such pouches usually affects westerners over 50, with the incidence increasing with age.A section of Slater’s small bowel had to be removed, along with his appendix. “There’s now a mesh attached to my spine to hold the bowel up,” he says. But two inoperable pouches remain. “I’m just waiting for one of them to suddenly wake up and then it will start again. I’m living day to day.” Meanwhile, he still has intermittent bleeding and is on medication for pain and to help his bowel function, along with a medium-fibre diet with plenty of fresh fruit, and wants to raise awareness of the condition.Trouble can occur when the pouches get pellets of fibrous material, known as fecaliths, lodged in them. This can be harmless, but will in some people lead to infection and inflammation and, in rare cases, perforation of the gut, causing intestinal waste to leak into the abdominal cavity.Much of the time, fecaliths lurking in erticular pouches aren’t remotely sinister. The trouble occurs, Spiller says, “if food residue gets stuck in there and puts pressure on the lining, which is very thin. Then it might cause a break in the lining and that might let bacteria in and cause inflammation.” Sometimes the pouches bleed and the worst-case scenario, he says, is if the walls burst. That condition, known as peritonitis, can be life-threatening.Diverticulitis is usually relatively straightforward to diagnose and treat, says Spiller. “You’ll get a fever, a raised white blood cell count, pain and tenderness – similar symptoms to appendicitis.” You might be hospitalised, but most cases can be treated with antibiotics. Infection can recur intermittently: “A quarter will get another attack in the next year.”What is more difficult to diagnose is when patients have pain related to the erticular pouches, but no infection. “There are people who get pain every day, which lasts a few hours, maybe precipitated by food. This is very difficult to distinguish from IBS,” says Spiller. In such cases, it may be that another underlying problem, such as “incoordinate contractions”, is causing both the pouches to form and the pain. Contractions in the bowel, Spiller explains, “are carefully controlled to move things along or hold them back. But if you have damage to the nerves, from ageing, for example, then these coordinations fail and that puts the pressure up.”Part of the reason the risk increases with age is that connective tissue weakens. While on the outside this leads to skin wrinkles, says Spiller, “internally, a weaker colon wall can lead to pouch formation”.Diverticulosis is a peculiarly western affliction, but Spiller says none of the theories about why this may be are proven by scientific study: “Many of them are probably wrong.” However, it is almost certainly linked to diet or environment. Diverticular disease is rare in Africa and Asia and studies have shown that the longer people from these areas live in North America or Europe, the higher their risk grows. “Something has made our colons not as strong as they should be,” Spiller says.A diet lacking in fibre gets most of the blame, but Spiller says the evidence is weak. The most-quoted study looked at data from 43,881 male healthcare professionals, but it only shows associations rather than causation. The study found that both consumers of high-fibre diets and dedicated exercisers had the lowest erticular disease risks. “You could say these people were more health-conscious overall and most of their diseases are less,” says Spiller.There are other elements of the western diet that could be weakening our guts. “It could be high fat,” says Spiller. “Some have argued that the bacteria are different in people with erticulitis, but there’s very little evidence on that at the moment.” There may even be other, non-dietary aspects of the western lifestyle that have an effect.The precise cause, he says, could only be established through long-term randomised trials with subjects consuming either a high-fibre or a low-fibre diet and then followed for 10-20 years – but this would be prohibitively expensive and unlikely to attract many participants. Meanwhile, this common condition, which Spiller says “can seriously impair the quality of life of elderly people, is neglected because it’s not an easy problem, and the fact that it doesn’t affect young people works against it. But I do think we need to raise awareness and more work should be done. It’s important.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cde27bbbd179b395a9a60635988a2c35d0ecd509/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09255d8f5750168506ee5a4f724b59a2","title":"seven ways to improve your breathing","story":"It may be instinctive, but stress, anxiety, posture and a host of other factors can affect the quality of our breathingBreathing is so instinctive, you may have developed habits you are not aware of. Start by monitoring your breathing for 48 hours, particularly at moments when you are stressed or anxious. Are you struggling for air, mouth-breathing, breathing rapidly or irregularly or deeply or shallowly?Better posture leads to better breathing, sometimes within just a few breaths. Correct postures means that the diaphragm – the muscle between the chest and the abdomen, which plays a key role in moving air in and out – is not constricted. Ensure that your back is upright and your shoulders back and down. Your chin needs to be very slightly raised and your jaw, shoulders and neck relaxed.Excessive sighing and yawning a feeling of not being able to get sufficient air, known as “air hunger” or a sense of being “spaced out” may all point to overbreathing (hyperventilation). This can become habitual. Breathing retraining may help, but first see your doctor for a check-up.That it’s healthy to breathe deeply is just a 20th century myth. When we are stressed or anxious, our breathing and heart rates increase breathing deeply leads to getting less oxygen, not more, and may increase anxiety and panic. Taking slow, gentle, controlled breaths will be more effective in helping to calm you down if you are stressed or anxious.Unless you are working or exercising vigorously, unblock your nose and get into the habit of nose breathing. It helps to filter pollutants, allergens and toxins as we inhale, and warms and humidifies the air. When we mouth-breathe, the volume of air is markedly increased, which can lead to a habit of overbreathing and increase anxiety it also dries out the mouth, and may lead to a variety of dental issues.Snoring can be associated with overbreathing, due to increased air volume, turbulence and vibration, and may lead to unrefreshing sleep, fatigue, waking with a dry mouth, sore throat or headaches. To improve snoring, always sleep on your side and avoid eating a large meal or drinking alcohol close to bedtime.When you feel anxious, take time out to destress and calm down your breathing. Introduce some destressing activities into your life a daily walk in a park or quiet area is great. When you are calm, you will find that your breathing is effortless, and this is the key to better breathing, refreshing sleep, improved mood and better health.• Breathe: The 4-week breathing retraining plan to relieve stress, anxiety and panic by Mary Birch is published by Piatkus, £13.99"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e32ef75a20b2a2df3118c5a054a2b18b4d30db98/0_582_6271_3763/master/6271.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f05faaea45aa19f950042ee143df19b4","title":"high rents alternative living arrangements","story":"With spiralling rents leaving many people with barely any disposable income, let alone the means to save towards a deposit, some are now choosing alternatives.Office administrator Tina Gotla-Aluri, 42, was struggling to cope with the £950 a month she was paying for her house share in Putney, south-west London, when a friend suggested Share and Care Homeshare, which matches older homeowners who have a spare room with people who can offer practical help in exchange. She now lives in Putney with a man in his 90s and pays £180 a month to the scheme.In return, Gotla-Aluri provides companionship, goes food shopping, and cooks meals. “He is quite well travelled and food is one of the things we have bonded over,” she says. “I cook British food like Sunday dinners and sometimes Indian or Moroccan food. It’s mutually beneficial.”She says the lower rent has made her less anxious about money. “It has given me breathing space. It was very stressful. I was only working to pay rent, and as an administrator I don’t make much. I hardly had anything left for food and travel. It was very depressing, but now I can go to the cinema and out with friends.”When Michael Hayne, 41, a delivery driver from Mansfield, split up with his wife after 10 years of marriage with two daughters, he sofa-surfed at various family members’ homes for about six months because he couldn’t afford to rent.“I worked out it was about £1,100 to get a house to rent plus bills,” he says. “I needed somewhere for the kids to stay and didn’t want a bedsit. I realised I wouldn’t have much money left after paying child maintenance and childcare costs.”He was inspired by reading about a couple who sold up and toured the world in a van. “I took out a loan and bought a Mercedes Sprinter van for £2,500 and spent weeks stripping it out and turning it into a home.” His van includes beds for when his daughters stay, a four-burner cooker and storage at the back for his bike.“I wanted a van because it’s cheaper than a camper van, which can cost upwards of £10,000, plus I like the style of a van. It’s a blank canvas that I can build myself. For example, I made a sleeping area for my girls, and I can change it around.”The cost of running the van, including vehicle tax and breakdown insurance but not petrol, sets him back about £70 a month.Hayne has lived in the van for a year and parks for free in country lanes and near industrial estates. He showers at a local gym. “The girls love it. They’ve been to Scotland, Whitby, Scarborough and the Norfolk coast. Not paying rent frees up the funds to do those things.”While some people house-sit for free to get a taste of luxury or a different life for a few weeks, designer Jennifer Hamley, 39, and her husband, Ben, 37, have turned it into a way to live rent-free.“We decided to try house-sitting after we came back from a year living in Bali,” says Hamley. “Rental prices had escalated and a friend suggested it. We run a business together from our laptops, and are used to being a little nomadic, so the idea suited us well.”The couple tend to stay in a property for at least three weeks, depending on what’s available. “Since we do this full time we tend to only apply for house-sits of three weeks or more. Running a business and moving around too much is way too stressful.”“It is a peace of mind for many homeowners. A homeowner doesn’t need to get anyone to check in on the house, and pet owners don’t have to pay kennels, catteries or dog walkers.”Sometimes there’s a signed agreement but mostly the exchange is done on trust. The duo try to line up consecutive house-sits but sometimes there are a few days’ gap, when they stay in a hotel, B\u0026ampB, Airbnb, or with friends.If Carl Francis, 27, was renting his one-bedroom flat in Barnet, north London, at market rates, he simply wouldn’t be able to afford it. But as a property  – a person who temporarily looks after an empty property that’s between uses in return for cheap rent – his rent comes to just £425 a month.“I didn’t want a cramped studio flat for £600,” he says. He found Dot Dot Dot, which provides affordable housing in buildings that range from flats and houses to churches and even disused fire stations. In return it asks s to volunteer for 16 hours a month with a charity of their choice.“I’m saving a hell of a lot more than if I was living on my own,” he says. The drawback is the property is set to be demolished. “Then I’ll be given 28 days’ notice. But I’ve been here for a year and it’s a really good way to live.”Patrick Smith, 62, the director of a vegan catering co-operative, lives with nine other people in a housing co-op in Nottingham, where he pays a fraction of the typical rent. Housing co-ops tend to be democratic organisations controlled by members, who set their own policies and decisions. In Smith’s co-op, the housemates have two meetings a month, discussing topics such as household issues, cleaning and checking in with others’ wellbeing.The household vies up chores, with each member spending 30 minutes a week cleaning a designated area. The tenants are the landlords and they set their own rent and take responsibility for the needs of the household.Each person has their own bedroom but shares communal areas such as lounge, bathrooms and kitchen, where every night a member cooks a group meal.“Rather than it just being about finances, everyone wants to engage in a sustainable cooperatively managed household.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

But any watering down or deregulation of existing standards could make the UK a magnet for cheap, substandard or counterfeit products, the ESF warns.Research by the charity last year found that one in three UK consumers – about 18 million people – had mistakenly bought a counterfeit electrical item online. Products with safety flaws ranged from large household appliances such as tumble dryers, to kettles, phones and chargers, travel adaptors, hair straighteners and Kodi boxes, which allow users to stream content from apps and on-demand services.Phil Buckle, the chief executive of the ESF, said: “No outcome from the ongoing EU-UK negotiations should be to the detriment of safety standards or consumer protection rights.“The risks posed by substandard and counterfeit electrical products are a very real threat to consumers’ safety. Electricity is responsible for more than half of accidental domestic fires in England and any weakening of such standards could see this figure rise in the future.“It is essential that enforcement bodies, which serve on the frontline in the fight against substandard and counterfeit electrical items, are adequately resourced to be as effective as possible as we depart from the European Union.”After Brexit, the UK will need to assume greater responsibility surrounding enforcement and checks of imports to assess compliance with new customs controls, the ESF says. To do so effectively, enforcement bodies, such as trading standards, must be adequately funded to take on this increase in responsibility.The most recent National Trading Standards Safety at Ports and Borders report identified 1.2m unsafe or non-compliant goods, which could have caused 500 fires, 1,000 major injuries and 2,000 minor injuries.

We have a PM who is incompetent and who has become an international embarrassment, an ineffectual leader of the opposition at odds with his membership and half his party and a media largely hell bent on driving us over the cliff. How has our once revered democracy morphed into this mess? DaivedoverEvery time that May makes a concession to the ERG they take a step back to reveal yet another demand and uncover more of the trap that has been there all along. She is like a weak, second-rate school teacher who is letting the louts in the back row of her class dominate and control all lessons. The ERG has a clear agenda of their own and that has nothing to do with what is best for the country or for the majority of people in the country. These are the arrogant and self-serving men who conned and coerced voters into taking back control and now expect that power to be given to them. Theresa May is incapable of spotting a wolf in wolf’s clothing. Why? John HewardYou get what you deserve. May has been trying to play to all sides of the argument. It cannot work. The hard right Tories will only accept a no strings deal. The more centrist Tories want to either remain or have a deal that to a certain extent, ties us to Europe. This is where Tories have existed for decades. Surely May didn’t really think that the two groups would unite over policies that either side could not agree to? She did not think to plan an exit before even triggering article 50. She should have spent a year in trying to find consensus instead of just applying her “my way or the byway” approach. Cameron is to blame for this fiasco, but May is guilty of completely mishandling the whole thing. morbileBrexit is bad enough, but the constitutional disaster that May and co are overseeing is worse. In the space of just over two months, her government has been found in contempt of parliament, and heavily lost votes on key items of government policy. Yet she maintains that nothing has changed, continues on her path unaltered with little or no admonition from the populist press or the public. Given the precedents she is setting - if a really competent leader ever got into power, imagine what havoc could be wreaked - as parliamentary scrutiny has effectively been shown to be, well, ineffective. dougmeyberryBetween the Malthouse fiasco and now the ERG abstaining on this vote (and handing May another authority sapping defeat) the PM needs to stop pretending that Rees-Mogg and his merry men will accept anything except a no-deal exit. The days are long gone where there was any point in pretending that she can somehow come to terms with them, except by a complete surrender to their position. If there are any solutions to this mess, it will be in found spite of the ERG, and pretending it can be part of any solution is delusional. CaligulaMcNuttMay’s premiership has delivered the very worst of all worlds. It has allowed the ERG to undermine her from the sidelines, given disproportionate levels of influence to the DUP, and allowed no-deal advocates like Davis and Raab to fritter away two years’ worth of negotiating time while supposedly acting as Brexit Secretary. On the evidence since 2017, May must now outstrip Cameron as our worst PM ever. Her almost unique combination of total inflexibility, weakness and insecurity leads to her appeasing the ERG and the hard Brexiteers in her own party while failing to realise that the ERG aren’t remotely interested in anything other than “no deal” WestonTigerSurely it’s time that even Theresa May acknowledges that the ERG are not acting in good faith? They’re advocating no deal because they know parliament will finally have too much sense to go down that route, leaving them free to proclaim their ideological purity and completely disassociate themselves from any problems that arise from Brexit. davidabsalomThe Tories have completely failed at every stage of this process, from calling a referendum on the issue in the first place to everything that has ensued as a result. Any PM with even a crumb of authority would have disciplined or expelled members of herhis party who vote against the interests of the nation. May clearly has no authority and, it is becoming clear, no respect for the good of the nation. Brexit must be paused of stopped altogether so we can bring in a government worthy of the name.

Ashton suffered the injury during a training session at Twickenham on Friday and after further assessment over the weekend he was left out of the 33-man squad which convened at England’s Bagshot base on Sunday night.England are confident Ashton will be fit to face Italy on 9 March but his absence against Wales is a setback for Eddie Jones, who is already without Mako Vunipola for the trip to Cardiff. Maro Itoje will continue his rehabilitation from a knee injury with England this week but he was not named as part of the squad and as a result is not in contention to face Wales. Dylan Hartley, meanwhile, will stay with Northampton, meaning he too will miss Saturday’s match.With Ashton unavailable Jack Nowell now appears in line to start against Wales – he may well have done so anyway considering he was preferred to Ashton against Ireland – but Joe Cokanasiga is another option after he made a try-scoring return to action for Bath on Saturday following 10 weeks out with a knee injury. The Gloucester wing Ollie Thorley is also part of the squad but he is still awaiting a Test debut.For Ashton it is more bad luck after a calf injury cut short his autumn campaign. He has won five caps since his return from France to Sale Sharks last summer, scoring one try against New Zealand, but the back three is arguably the most hotly contested area of Jones’s squad with Anthony Watson still to return from a long-term achilles injury to press his World Cup claims. Ashton was handed a first Six Nations start for six years in the 44-8 victory over France last Sunday on what Jones described as a “gut feeling” before being replaced by Nowell after 51 minutes.Cokanasiga, meanwhile, believes his injury was the best thing that could have happened after scoring two tries in his first two England matches against Japan and Australia in November. The 21-year-old suffered knee ligament damage on his return for Bath in early December and had not played since until his club’s 30-13 win over Newcastle on Saturday.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels“I was blowing at the end of the game but I am confident with the knee and ready for the challenge ahead,” said Cokanasiga. “Eddie spoke to me about getting some game time and being available for selection against Wales. I would like to get a shot against Wales but this is a big year and there are plenty of opportunities. The injury was one of the best things that could have happened to me because I could easily have become complacent after the autumn and relaxed. Now I have to fight to get my place back and there is no danger of complacency.”With Vunipola sidelined, Alec Hepburn has been called in as loosehead cover with either Ellis Genge or Ben Moon expected to start against Wales. Charlie Ewels is also added, taking the place of Nick Isiekwe, who was part of the wider squad for the France match."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1d75f8b422739f78742cc9fe7f1c47e9f067d57/35_16_3411_2048/master/3411.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7792778be1510e8d1db577edccadb5b","title":"danni wyatt horrible thoughts england india tour","story":"Wyatt has become England’s key T20 player over the past year or so and attributes her improved performances in limited-overs cricket to relaxation and perspectiveDanni Wyatt has been having trouble sleeping.

In the final game of the series she hit an extraordinary 57-ball 100 which levelled the Ashes.A few months later she scored a 64-ball 124 against India, meaning at that stage she had England’s only two T20 international centuries (Tammy Beaumont joined her with 116 against South Africa in the summer). A few more key contributions followed and her transformation from decent middle-order bat who bowled neat off-spin to arguably England’s key T20 player was complete.“It’s definitely up here,” she taps her head, when asked about what changed. “Being more relaxed. In the past I’ve probably not been as selfish as I should have been. I’d go out there and get a good 20 but 20s aren’t going to win you games of cricket. You’ve got to go out there and bat longer.“It’s about not giving my wicket away. In the past, if I had a few dot balls, I’d start swinging away and get out. Now, if I’ve got a few dot balls, I’ll maybe just take a single. I’ve definitely matured a lot, which has been needed.”Perspective is a big part of it, too. Some sportspeople like to give the impression that their game is the most important thing in the world, and that’s the only way they will perform. Wyatt takes the opposite approach. “As you get older, you definitely think: ‘It’s just a game of cricket.’ You see ball, hit ball. Whereas in the past I’ve been a bit stressed. I’ve felt like, if I don’t get runs, I’ll get dropped. It’s about getting those horrible thoughts out of your head. If you’ve got the belief of your captain and coach, you’ll be in a good place to perform.”Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsWyatt has not had time to reflect on a successful, if relentless, spell of her career but she prefers it that way. “Personally I’m not that fussed,” she says, when asked if a lack of head space to contemplate developments is a problem. “I went from the World T20, came back to England for two nights and then straight out to Australia for the Big Bash. I like to think about the past, learn from it, move on, concentrate on the next challenge. It’s nonstop now but that’s what we want.”A couple of recent disappointments will drive Wyatt, too. In November England barely showed up in the World T20 final: they posted only 105 (of which Wyatt contributed 43), a score Australia knocked off with 29 balls to spare. And then Wyatt’s Melbourne Renegades were beaten in the semi-final of the Women’s Big Bash, the ever-magnificent Ellyse Perry smacking a six in a dramatic super over to win for Sydney Sixers.Australia are on the horizon again, touring England for the Ashes in the summer, but before that there are three ODIs and T20s in India, then the same again in Sri Lanka. Those 50-over games will give Wyatt another target: having established herself as one of the world’s top T20 players, she wants to do the same in ODIs.“Coming in at five or six, on a good day I’ve got 15 overs to go, so it is kind of like a T20,” she says. “My job probably will be to bat with intent from ball one, like I do in T20. The ball will be a bit older, more fielders out, but that’s my goal: to be one of the best finishers in the world.” After the last year or so, one would not doubt her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1de15ca4734a264e695e47845751db2f3bad96fe/994_600_1956_1174/master/1956.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=373496b31e93472ec0fb991a4a1bfec5","title":"good dog review traverse edinburgh arinze kene 2011 uk riots","story":"Traverse, EdinburghKwaku Mills is a revelation as a boy growing up amid poverty in this touring revival of Arinzé Kene’s crackling, compelling monologueImagine an inner-city version of Under Milk Wood – a tapestry of urban life that’s wry, non-judgmental and crackling with linguistic vigour. That is the initial flavour of Arinzé Kene’s compelling monologue from 2017, revived for a UK tour in Natalie Ibu’s excellent production for Tiata Fahodzi and Tara Finney Productions. But appearances are deceptive: this is a play with a sting in its tale.What strikes you at first is the magnanimity of it all. Where the narrator of the Dylan Thomas poem looks omnisciently over the philandering, drunkenness and small-time scams of the fictional Welsh village of Llareggub, the 13-year-old boy at the heart of Good Dog looks down acceptingly on the quirks of his neighbours from the balcony of his flat in Tottenham, north London.He sees Trevor Senior schooling his son in cricket in the hope of keeping him out of trouble. He sees the shopkeeper known as Gandhi reluctantly befriending the stray cat that becomes his only friend. He sees the disaffected “smoking boys” loitering on the corner and the shoplifting teenagers he calls the “what-what girls” because “what” is the full extent of their vocabulary.There’s the good-natured alcoholic Old Man Boateng, wishing everybody well, and the glass-half-full Mrs Blackwood, who cottons on to her husband’s infidelities long after everyone else. In the beauty parlour, market and bike shop, people get on with their lives, while the warring dogs bark themselves hoarse in the front gardens. The boy sees it all and relates it with matter-of-fact innocence.Even with the malevolent mockery of the smoking boys and the incessant bullying at school, the play has an all-life-is-here charm. It seems whimsical and forgiving. Kwaku Mills makes it more so in a performance of evangelical radiance. In his vest and jogging trousers, he surveys a landscape scarred by violence and poverty as if it were a scene of bountiful joy. Bright-eyed and eager, he filters even the bleakest vision through a whitewashing philosophy of “juss goodness all the way”.So vivid is the attention to detail that you take its developing narrative at face value. Sheltering in the library from the taunts of his classmates, the boy develops a wordless relationship with the shy and neglected Jamilla, a love affair brimming with us-against-the-world hope. As the boy’s mother sinks into a drunken depression, he and Jamilla take on her catering business, building themselves an escape route as they make it a success.This seems possible even as Mills deepens his voice and dims the sunniness in his eyes. The actor’s growth from boy to man is chilling and true, but even as he toughens up there is a spark of the old optimism yet.What Kene demonstrates, however, is how the constant drip-drip of deprivation, exacerbated by nihilistic violence, eventually has an impact. Even with a cheery disposition and an ethos of Christian forgiveness, something has to give. Like the dog that bites back after being cowed by her bigger neighbour, both the boy and the society he lives in are at a breaking point. Without offering easy solutions, the playwright shows that what happens next – the London riots of 2011 – are not a considered act of political protest but an inarticulate howl of rage. For all its self-destructive contradictions, it is a howl that must be heard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24bd5e676ad56c5131896b8c7c609727a90e1656/0_0_1585_951/master/1585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bda46d5e2bebd68721761cf70bf7a2e","title":"only fools and horses musical plonker lovely jubbly","story":"It was the cushty comedy that perfectly captured 80s Britain. As Only Fools and Horses hits the stage, we celebrate the TV classic that needed a new scale to measure audience laughterBack in 1991, Peckham’s leading entrepreneur Boycie paid a visit to one of Peckham’s not so leading entrepreneurs in Nelson Mandela House, SE15. He wasn’t happy to be in Derek “Del Boy” Trotter’s flat, and not just because of the horrible carpet, tacky furniture and pretentious drinks bar. “I’d like to get away as quick as possible,” he said. “I’ve left my Mercedes parked downstairs and you know what they’re like on this estate. They’d have the wheels off a Jumbo if it flew too low.”That might have been what Peckham was like in the early 90s, but not today. Now it’s all pop-up this, artisanal that, symphony concerts in the multi-storey car park, and no change from a million quid if you seek to live in a three-bed terrace off Rye Lane. Like Boycie, Peckham has gone up in the world.Back in its day – the seven series that ran between 1981 and 1991, and several Christmas specials after that – Only Fools and Horses seemed to unite Britain. It still holds the UK record for the biggest audience of a single transmission of a TV programme (24.35 million for the 1996 Christmas special) and it bejewelled spoken English with such gems as “cushty” and “lovely jubbly”. But if Peckham has changed beyond recognition, will anyone care about a new Only Fools musical written by its creator John Sullivan’s son Jim and comedy actor Paul Whitehouse?Of course they will, you plonker! Because Only Fools always appealed most to the demographic who didn’t believe the hype. Those for whom work ethic homilies were nonsense spoken by an establishment striving to keep riff raff in their place. Forget chancellor Philip Hammond’s budget “for hard working families, the strivers, the grafters and the carers.” Only Fools always embraced the scammers, skivers, idlers, loafers, slackers and anyone else who has realised the existential truth at the heart of Sullivan’s title song for the show, namely that only fools and horses work. In 2019, the adventures of a family living off its nerves and ingenuity would still speak to millions.The Peckham-born son of Sri Lankan immigrants Jason Murugesu nailed Only Fools’s appeal in a piece for the New Statesman: “Immigrants understood when Del mispronounced words and used fancy phrases he didn’t know the meaning of. As Del’s Reliant Robin, which proudly proclaimed that he did business in ‘New York – Paris – Peckham’ made evident, this was a man who desperately wanted to belong, failing to fit into the aspirational lifestyle of the 90s. Del Boy was like all the immigrants who laughed at his antics. They related to him even if he was a middle-aged white man.”Murugesu’s mum and dad found Del Boy so relatable that they named their boy after the actor who played Peckham’s finest, David Jason. While other iconic sitcoms, such as Friends or Seinfeld, later dramatised the aspirational lifestyles of middle-class neurotics with first-world problems, Only Fools captured the struggle of those sucking on the fuzzy end of life’s lollipop. Few British sitcoms or dramas dealt poignantly with working-class experience Only Fools did that and something else. It wasn’t just about working-class struggles, but about escaping the tyranny of work.As for the difference between Peckham then and now, maybe it’s not as big as you might think. While on the surface the area appears to have sold its soul for artisanal polenta and gentrified beards, consider what urban ethnographer at the LSE Suzanne Hall told me four years ago. “There are plenty of Del Boys around Peckham now. It’s just that they’re more likely to be Albanian or Nigerian than white working-class English people. There’s plenty of ducking and ing going on.” The old Del Boy would still feel right at home.One could make a case for Del Boy as the personification of Thatcherite neoliberal philosophy. After Maggie had destroyed our manufacturing base and made London the world capital of deregulated finance, City yuppies flogged financial products as unreliable as the bottles of Peckham Spring Water (tap water) Del offloaded in the 1992 Christmas special. What Del preached from the back of his reliant Robin (“No income tax, no VAT, no money back, no guarantee … ”) was a south London echo of what the City of London’s finest were doing on a grand scale a few miles away: mugging off their muppet clients, scamming, flim-flamming, ducking and ing, smashing and grabbing. That neoliberal ethos is still with us, and the scamming business model hasn’t fallen out of favour.Del Boy once explained his business model to Rodney: “I see it as a combination of my business acumen and salesmanship, and your ability to drive a three-wheeled van … badly.” Viewed thus, Del Boy was south London’s retort to north London’s Thatcherite plasterer Loadsamoney. “Oi you!  Shut your mouth and look at my wad!” quoth he at the start of his 1987 hit single. But Harry Enfield’s character was a heartless tool with only a brief claim on our attention s. Del Boy was something else: a charmer whose dodgy means to questionable ends didn’t provoke moral condemnation.Partly this was because we knew he was always going to get his comeuppance. What resonates down the years is the underdog getting bitten on the bum by fate – a timeless conceit that traditionally appeals to Britons. We cut down tall poppies, but hold dear those who aspire but fail, get up, dust themselves down, try again. In this, Del Boy Trotter was the funnyman Samuel Beckett never wrote. Only Fools was Chekhovian, too, in evoking characters trapped in a lot beneath their aspirations. Many great British sitcoms from Steptoe and Son in the 1960s to Man Like Mobeen now, have dramatised that theme, but none as consistently funnily as Only Fools.In a sense, Del Boy is Uncle Vanya in a sheepskin, with better gags and much more moxie, while Rodney is south London’s answer to Chekhovian lugubriousness, one prone to paradoxical comedy depression: “I’ve got this horrible feeling that if there is such a thing as reincarnation,” Rodney said once, “knowing my luck I’ll come back as me.”In his autobiography, David Jason recalled filming a scene in which Rodney and Del Boy were arguing over Rodney’s plans to go it alone and invest £200 as start-up capital in the self-catering holiday trade. Grandad, who had been speechless and probably asleep during the scene, suddenly pipes up: “What you got, Rodney – a Wendy house?” As Jason recalled: “It’s hard even now to summon words that adequately account for the volume of laughter this got from the studio audience. The laughter went on so long, it threatened to run into the next episode.”The result was an Only Fools laughter ratings system, where jokes were judged according to their perceived “Wendy-ness”: there were sub-Wendy and mini-Wendy ratings for decent jokes, but what you really wanted was a full-blown Wendy. Sullivan supplied many of those over the years. Once Del praised Grandad’s cooking: “It’s the toughest chicken I’ve ever known. It’s asked me for a fight in the car park twice.” On another occasion, Trigger, the road sweeper, said of his father: “He died a couple of years before I was born.” But my favourite full-blown Wendy was Raquel’s back-handed compliment to Del: “Derek, will you get it into your thick skull, I’m not trying to meet intelligent and sensitive people, I’m happy with you.” When Sullivan died in 2011, the BBC’s head of comedy, Mark Freeland, said: “He was the Dickens of our generation.” He certainly depicted his London with a similar fondness and sense of comic absurdity.I don’t know if the new musical will retread Sullivan’s outro for the show, but I hope so. Nothing could sum up Britain in 2019 better than: “We’ve got some half price cracked ice  And miles and miles of carpet tiles  TVs, deep freeze, David Bowie LPs  Ball games, gold chains, whatsernames, picture frames  And, at a push, some Trevor Francis track suits  From a mush in Shepherds Bush.” Viva, as the song goes, Hooky Street.• Only Fools and Horses Musical opens at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London, on 19 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c2acaecc9d2bc813bacbf88027c3825d2e5af08/0_367_4899_2941/master/4899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72b5ee0ba7cc107e574445e6b1271b0c","title":"cornwall celtic walk coast path trail hike","story":"A network of old footpaths, mapped by a local vicar to form a new long-distance trail, is dotted with reminders of a spiritual pastOn the strand at Downderry, my guidebook suggests, I should pick up a pebble. “Choose one to mark the start of your journey,” it counsels. I settle on a charcoal-coloured stone featuring lots of vaguely psychedelic parallel pink lines. Some erge and thicken as others separate, going solo. It makes me think first of a network of paths – and then of how lives are spent sometimes in solitude, sometimes surrounded by loved ones.OK, it’s not exactly Nietzsche, but pleasant philosophical musings typify my three days on the Cornish Celtic Way: a new long-distance walking route that takes visitors away from many of the county’s over-visited spots. Dreamed up by a 55-year-old clergyman, the 125-mile trail joins existing paths, bridleways and back roads from sleepy St Germans on the River Tiddy to the coastal village of Downderry, before taking the coast path – further-flung sections of which are wonderfully quiet – all the way to Polruan at the mouth of the River Fowey. After a ferry across to Fowey town, there’s a northerly traverse through quiet countryside to Padstow, before rejoining the coast path – with occasional detours inland.Swerving south before busy St Ives, the route heads back across the county and finishes at the small tidal island of St Michael’s Mount. That amounts to 16 stages which can be completed in two weeks at a leisurely pace, or done in smaller sections.The eponymous laminated guidebook to the route (£15) is written by the Reverend Nigel Marns, vicar at the 14th-century St Paul’s church in Ludgvan, near Marazion, one of the stars of stage 15.It’s a delightful publication, with directions accompanied by poems, songs, quotations, suggestions for activities – such as the Downderry pebble pick-up – and questions for contemplation, around qualities such as patience. And it’s not overly religious.“I’m trying to do something a bit new,” says Marns, who also runs guided group walks on the route. “It’s not purely a hiking guide instructing you to turn left at the third hedge, nor a dry historical text.”It works for me. As I ramble from St Germans to narrow-laned Polperro over two days, and then across country from the outskirts of St Ives to Marazion in one more, the book provides succour and perspective. Take the moment when, sweary after being stung by a nettle outside Seaton, I open it to find an excerpt from Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov. “Love the animals, love the plants, love everything,” it urges. “If you love everything you will perceive the ine mystery in all things.” A bit on the hippy side, perhaps, but I grit my teeth and try to love the nettle.There are some biblical passages (the Celtic Way is intended as a pilgrimage route, after all) but the trail, and the book, will also appeal to anyone fond of history or mysticism. Celtic crosses – stone Christian crosses topped with a ring, common to regions evangelised by Irish missionaries between the 9th and 12th centuries – regularly appear, while standing stones await at St Breock. And close to Perranporth is St Piran’s Oratory, a haunting duneside ruin.And, of course, like Spain’s Camino de Santiago pilgrimage routes, the Celtic Way can be undertaken purely as a hiking challenge. There are lusty hills to climb for majestic views. There are flower-festooned lanes blitzed by butterflies in summer, rust-coloured woodlands in autumn. There are white sand beaches galore, and plenty of highlights: Treffry Viaduct, pretty Fowey and, finally, St Michael’s Mount itself. Being car-free and getting off the beaten track is the biggest bonus.This is a walk for Christians and those of other faiths or none at all. “We live in an era beset by crises, be they ecological or humanitarian, and I think pilgrims or people on a journey often carry those problems with them – as well as their own worries,” says Marns. “Walking pace allows for the gathering of thoughts – a chance to work things out.”Still, at certain times, all pondering must be interrupted to settle a timeless dilemma: left or right? Thankfully, Marns’ directions and maps are excellent, and I never once get lost. His timings and stage gradings also impress.Currently, the chief omission is accommodation suggestions. In future, Marns and his team aim to suggest a range of financial options – from £100-a-night guesthouses to church floors for the pious and less flush – but this won’t happen before next spring.

Warren and Klobuchar join senators Kirsten Gillibrand (New York), Kamala Harris (California) and Cory Booker (New Jersey), as well as Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, former San Antonio mayor Julián Castro and former Maryland congressman John Delaney.Nearly all have touted their progressive bona fides in the hopes of appealing to an energized base. That, some operatives say, has left the “centrist” lane open, at a time when the party must win back working-class and independent voters who chose Trump in 2016.At the same time, some argue that debate over the Democrats’ supposed “lurch to the left”, as relentlessly highlighted by the president, is an oversimplification that overlooks the Democratic electorate’s desire to limit Trump to one term.“The challenge for Democrats will be to have a substantive, even heated debate over progressive policy while still reminding voters that re-electing Trump would be a catastrophe,” said Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Barack Obama whose podcast, The Wilderness, examined the rebuilding of the party after 2016.“Democratic candidates should debate each other but they shouldn’t disqualify each other,” he said.It’s all a far cry from the 2016 primary, when the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders mounted an unexpectedly tough challenge to Hillary Clinton, from the left and with lasting consequences.Sanders pushed Clinton on issues including climate change, trade, Wall Street reform and college affordability. As he did so, he strengthened the progressive wing of the party.Most 2020 candidates have offered progressive platforms. Warren, Gillibrand, Harris and Booker have signed on to Medicare for All, the single-payer healthcare proposal drafted by Sanders. Warren and Gillibrand have called for abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the agency at the heart of Trump’s hardline agenda. Harris has said its role must be reformed.Many of the contenders have pushed a variation of debt-free college tuition and Warren, Gillibrand, Booker and Harris have embraced the Green New Deal championed by rising star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.In a sign of the potential rifts to come, Klobuchar said proposals such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All were “aspirational”.Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who was chief economics adviser to vice-president Joe Biden, said Democrats were broadly aligned on principles but differed on how to pursue them.“There’s going to be a lot of Democrats on the stage when the primaries begin,” he said, “but I don’t think there’ll be nearly as much distance between them as people think.”Differences, he said, would likely amount to one candidate campaigning on a subsidized jobs program tailored to a marginal group versus another advocating for a guaranteed jobs program affecting millions of people.“They’re all trying to solve the same problems,” he said. “Excessive levels of wealth concentration, money in politics, climate, affordable access to higher education. The question is how far does each of them want to push in terms of solutions to those problems.”Biden has been mulling a third run for president and would be the most establishment-friendly figure if he did jump in. He leads several early polls, bolstered in part by name recognition and Obama’s legacy.Other potential contenders include Sanders, who would seek to recapture the grassroots energy of 2016, and Beto O’Rourke, the former congressman whose unsuccessful Senate bid in Texas earned national attention. The Ohio senator Sherrod Brown, another favorite of progressives, staged a listening tour in key states and is expected to mount a bid.Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, expressed frustration that debate in the party was “frozen in time”, in 2016, and thereby ignoring victories in the 2018 midterms.“The electorate is liberal but more practical than the discussion seems to belie,” she said. “I think subconsciously they will think about electability and who can assemble the biggest coalition to take on Trump.”Tanden also warned of potential blowback from pressure to adopt striking positions, stating: “In 2018, there was not a single candidate in a swing district who embraced abolishing Ice. People talked about reforming Ice.”Republicans have sought to cast the Democrats’ agenda as “socialist”, zeroing in on healthcare and tax proposals that poll better than the GOP seems to think.Trump previewed a likely 2020 attack line in his state of the union address, declaring: “Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country.”“Tonight,” he said, “we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.”But even as roughly half of voters appear to be skeptical of a “socialist” candidate, the country’s definition of socialism has evolved towards a concept of equality, calling into question whether it is still an effective scare word.Favreau said he did not believe most voters would impose a “litmus test” on most issues. But he cautioned any candidates who might be inclined to play it safe.“I do think Democrats are looking for candidates who are willing to propose solutions that are commensurate with the magnitude of the challenges we’re facing,” he said. “Saving the planet and guaranteeing universal healthcare will require more than a few new tax credits and regulations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ee290be57b30b975bbe42451704985ef0badd87/1_283_957_574/master/957.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c466ee6fcf3906e3194505771d691f04","title":"flybmi tells customers to seek refunds from credit card companies","story":"Sister group Loganair to take over some routes as thousands remain out-of-pocketFlybmi is advising customers to seek refunds from credit and debit card companies or rebook with other airlines after the company collapsed late on Saturday, leading to the cancellation of thousands of journeys.On Sunday night, it emerged that Flybmi’s Glasgow-based sister company Loganair, which flies to the Scottish Highlands and Islands as well as to a small number of destinations in England, Ireland and Scandinavia, was poised to step in and take over five of Flybmi’s routes from next month.Loganair said it was in a “strong financial position” and would be flying from Aberdeen to Bristol, Oslo and Esbjerg, as well as from Newcastle to Brussels and to Stavanger in Norway. It was also “evaluating Flybmi’s wider network”.Jonathan Hinkles, Loganair’s managing director, said: “It’s always really sad to see an airline go out of business, and our thoughts are with all those affected – particularly staff members. We are evaluating Flybmi’s wider network and assessing routes which align with Loganair’s distinct geographical area and overall strategic plans. We are also working on employment opportunities for pilots, cabin crew and engineering support staff to strengthen the Loganair team.”Thousands of passengers have been left out-of-pocket after Flybmi, which operated more than 600 flights a week from regional airports including Bristol, Newcastle, Aberdeen and East Midlands, said it was calling in administrators.Some passengers are able to rebook via partner airlines Lufthansa, Brussels Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Loganair, Air France and Air Dolomiti, who have “shared ticket” flights with Flybmi.Ryanair said it was offering special cheap “rescue fares” between Belfast and London Stansted and to Milan Bergamo and Nuremberg to help stranded travellers. EasyJet said it was offering a special £80 deal for stranded passengers wanting to fly between Bristol and Paris Charles de Gaulle airport. Flybmi said its trading and future prospects had been “seriously affected by the uncertainty created by the Brexit process”. Spikes in fuel prices and a rise in carbon costs resulting from the EU’s recent decision to exclude UK airlines from full participation in the Emissions Trading Scheme had also contributed to its demise.Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, the industry association that represents 13 UK carriers, said: “Today’s announcement demonstrates once again the ferociously competitive environment airlines currently operate in. It should give government – and other parts of the industry who relentlessly champion passenger growth but too frequently neglect the challenges carriers face – pause for thought.”Regional carriers have been particularly vulnerable to increased costs because their small planes and less popular destinations mean costs per seat are already higher than bigger rivals.Exeter-based Flybe put itself up for sale in November and has warned shareholders it will have to be wound up if they do not back a sale to a Virgin Atlantic-led consortium.John Strickland at JLS Consulting said Brexit had piled on the pressure for UK operators partly because such airlines were less able to fund the cost of securing separate licences to operate in both the UK and Europe – rather than one for both.He said Flybmi was also likely to have suffered as it had a large number of business travellers and struck special deals with business customers such as Airbus, for which it was shuttling staff between Toulouse and Bristol.“Maybe some clients, with all the uncertainty around about Brexit will have been unwilling to extend or renew contracts,” Strickland said.Flybmi, which employs 376 staff and has a fleet of 17 aircraft covering 25 European cities, told aircrew not to turn up for work. Affected passengers were told not to go to the airport unless they had rebooked flights with alternative providers. Flybmi said it was not able to buy or rearrange journeys for its customers.Hundreds of passengers expressed dismay on social media at the sudden demise of an airline that was urging people to book flights via Twitter up until the day before its collapse.Hannah Price, 23, was concerned she would not be able to recoup £550 spent on five flights to Brussels where she travels frequently on business.Her flight was a shared ticket with Brussels Airline and that company has arranged for her to fly back to Bristol via Amsterdam on Monday, but her journey time will now be seven hours rather than two. “It’s good news that I am getting back to Bristol but it’s still frustrating,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83744e16b8bf43dc8030542e677fea0b14341a7b/344_692_5087_3052/master/5087.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=224207d6c2535abafc30b13118a77da9","title":"cubas churches reject gay marriage before vote on new constitution","story":"Methodist bishop says ‘historic’ protest is first time since revolution that churches have agreed on a causeMore than 100 married couples dressed in their wedding clothes have gathered on the Malecón coastal boulevard to renew their wedding vows and protest against gay marriage being allowed in Cuba.The protest is the latest in an unprecedented campaign by evangelical churches against elements of the island’s new constitution, which will be put to a referendum next Sunday.“We’re speaking out in favour of marriage as it was originally designed,” said Bishop Ricardo Pereira of the Methodist Church of Cuba, who emphasised that the event was not political but an “expression of faith”.“It’s the first time since the triumph of the revolution that evangelical churches have created a unified front. It’s historic,” he added, as drivers honked at women in wedding dresses and unwitting tourists in pink Cadillacs waved.Clutching a bunch of flowers next to her husband, Debora Lisset Covas, 32, insisted the demonstration was not homophobic.“My auntie is a lesbian and I have homosexual friends and colleagues. They are all creations of God and I love them,” she said. “But I don’t want gender ideology to be taught in schools. That’s what happens in other countries once gay marriage is legalised.”While the state is using television, newspapers and public billboards to urge the population to vote yes to the new constitution, evangelical denominations have run a bullish and unprecedented counter-campaign.Methodist, Pentecostal, Baptist and Assembly of God denominations have hung three-metre banners on their churches reading: “I’m in favour of the original design. Marriage: man + woman.”Churches have printed hundreds of thousands of posters and flyers which the faithful have stuck on doors, lamp posts and inside buses.The church delivered a petition with 178,000 signatures against the legal recognition of gay marriage to Cuba’s National Assembly in October last year – an event without historical parallel on the island.The church’s highly organised operation has overwhelmed the campaign in support of gay marriage run by the state-linked National Centre for Sex Education (Cenesex) and the island’s LGBT community. Most independent LGBT activists on the island have relied mainly on social media posts.The Cuban government backed away from enshrining gay marriage in the new constitution after widespread popular rejection. In the public consultations about the new constitution organised in neighbourhoods, workplaces, and universities last year, Cubans made 192,408 comments on Article 68 – which defined marriage as “the voluntary union between two people” rather than a union “between man and woman” as in the current constitution. A strong majority requested that Article 68 be eliminated.Cuba’s National Assembly announced on Twitter in December that it had eliminated the language “as a way of respecting all opinions”. The final constitution to be voted on by the population waters down the initial wording while leaving the door open to the legalisation of gay marriage in the future.Analysts expect the yes vote to win comfortably and turnout to be high. But a significant no vote would reflect a political opening on the island coupled with a new generation of leadership that has not yet cemented its authority."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae4124514b0452174e52f7496e9eacd217785762/35_63_2266_1360/master/2266.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a01d650816db3f752787e96bc473272d","title":"islamist extremism in uk shamima begum","story":"Counter-extremism chief makes comments as debate continues over Shamima BegumIslamist extremism is a “chronic and pernicious” issue that has persisted in the UK for decades with hundreds of young Muslims leaving the country to fight for Isis, according to the lead commissioner for countering extremism.The comments from Sara Khan came as debate continues about whether Shamima Begum, 19, a teenager who travelled to Syria to join Islamic State, should be allowed to return to Britain.The teenager called on people in the UK to have sympathy for her, the day after giving birth to a boy in a refugee camp. Begum spoke to the Times while still pregnant earlier this week from the al-Hawl refugee camp in north-eastern Syria, saying said she was desperate to come back to the UK.She added: “I see lots of legal, extremist, radical content online. There is a legitimate question of freedom of speech – we must protect freedom of expression in this country – but I want to see more challenge of extremist beliefs and extremist ideology. We all have a role in that regard. Schools can play an important role in having those conversations. … Faith leaders have a role in deconstructing Islamist ideology and beliefs.”Speaking to Sky News on Sunday while sitting with her baby, Begum said: “I feel a lot of people should have sympathy for me, for everything I’ve been through. You know, I didn’t know what I was getting into when I left.”Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme, Khan said she was concerned about what had radicalised the 19-year-old and what lessons could be learned about what attracted her to extremist ideas.“It’s important to understand when she travelled … she was aware of Daesh beheadings and executions … was becoming more religiously inclined. There are questions about how a young girl was exposed to extremist ideology – some online – and what more we can do to counter than ideology.“What support can we give to families fearing their children are being targeted by Islamist extremists?”Khan was questioned about the role of Tower Hamlets council, which did not conduct a serious case review on Begum. “There are far more chronic and pernicious issues. This is not just about Daesh targeting young people. This is about chronic Islamist extremism that has persisted in our country for decades. We saw what happened after 77. We have seen the fact hundreds of young Muslims left our country to fight for Isis. This is a much wider issue and that is issue want to understand better.“We can talk about those issues and answer those questions but is our response to extremism sufficient? Do we understand the tactics and how young people are targeted?”Khan said it was important to show young people that if they crossed the line there would be punishments. “The challenge is that a lot of extremist content seen online is lawful – radicalising, harmful and online… if people are spouting extremist beliefs that does not necessarily mean what doing or saying is illegal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64a39be36ce1bafca8747e23942c70f55eb1f9fd/0_234_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85c37fefa20f73dece1caad5a184cb1f","title":"monday briefing facebook branded digital gangster","story":"Inquiry into fake news demands regulation of social networks … pleas of UK and US Isis wives to come home … and Flybmi collapse strands passengersHello, it’s Warren Murray shaking the tree of news to see what falls out.Mark Zuckerberg’s social network deliberately broke privacy and competition law and must be brought under regulation, according to a devastating parliamentary report denouncing the company and its executives as “digital gangsters”.The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee says its 18-month investigation into disinformation and fake news was deliberately obstructed by Facebook. Among key points, it says Facebook has failed to tackle attempts by Russia to manipulate elections warns British electoral law is too weak to stop foreign interference and concludes that the Cambridge Analytica scandal was facilitated by Facebook’s policies.The report cites Germany – where tech companies are required by law to remove hate speech within 24 hours or face a €20m (£17.5m) fine – as an example to follow. “Social media companies cannot hide behind the claim of being merely a ‘platform’ and maintain that they have no responsibility themselves in regulating the content of their sites.” Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, refused three demands to give evidence to the committee.Europe told to deal with Isis fighters – Donald Trump has called for EU countries to repatriate and put on trial the 800 Islamic State combatants from Europe who have been captured in Syria by US-backed forces. “The alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them,” said the president. “The US does not want to watch as these Isis fighters permeate Europe, which is where they are expected to go.” A young Isis mother, Hoda Muthana, now 24, from Alabama, is in the al-Hawl refugee camp in north-eastern Syria.

I believe that America gives second chances. I want to return and I’ll never come back to the Middle East.”Meanwhile Shamima Begum, the British teenager who also married into Isis in Syria, has given birth to a son in the al-Hawl camp and repeated her call to be allowed home: “You know, I didn’t know what I was getting into when I left. I was hoping that maybe for the sake of me and my child they let me come back.”Goodbye Flybmi – Customers of the collapsed airline Flybmi are being told to seek refunds from their credit card companies or rebook with its partner airlines. Ryanair and easyJet have said they will offer special prices on some routes to stranded Flybmi passengers. The airline, which says it called in administrators partly because of Brexit uncertainty, operated more than 600 flights a week from regional airports including Bristol, Newcastle, Aberdeen and East Midlands. Flybmi’s Glasgow-based sister company Loganair says it will step in and take over five of Flybmi’s routes from March and look at the airline’s wider network, as well as possibly taking on some of its pilots, crew and ground staff.Backstop stuck fast – Theresa May has written to every Tory MP telling them she will try to eliminate the risk of the Brexit backstop being applied indefinitely and urging them to “move beyond what ides us and sacrifice personal preferences for the national interest”. This week, May will speak to every EU leader and meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, as she seeks a reopening of the withdrawal text. Today, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, will meet the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to discuss proposals to replace the backstop. On Tuesday, Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, will set out how the government thinks the backstop problem can be legally solved. Tobias Ellwood, one of May’s defence ministers, has said he will vote against the government if necessary to prevent a no-deal Brexit. On the Labour side, there are calls this morning for restive MPs to stay the course rather than quitting in protest at Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership on Brexit and other issues including antisemitism.‘Administrative coup’ attempt on Trump – Republicans have called for an investigation over claims that officials discussed invoking the constitution to remove Donald Trump from the presidency. Andrew McCabe, whom Trump fired as acting FBI director in March 2018, told CBS that the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein sounded out members of Trump’s cabinet regarding the 25th amendment to the constitution and its as-yet-unused provision for the removal of a president deemed incapable of discharging his duties. Rosenstein also offered to wear a wire to gather evidence against Trump, 60 Minutes reported. Rosenstein – who perhaps remarkably is still deputy attorney general – has denied the claims. McCabe told 60 Minutes that Trump told intelligence officials “I don’t care. I believe Putin,” when they apparently contradicted the Russian president in warning of the danger posed to the US by North Korean missiles.‘Whitewash’ claim over Grenfell – Firefighters fear they are being “stitched up” in the Grenfell Tower inquiry because their role has already been heavily scrutinised while the failings of government and building companies have not. A Channel 4 Dispatches documentary tonight will report that 55 of the people who died had taken the fire brigade’s advice to “stay put”. But Matt Wrack, the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, countered: “The only thing they did on the night was turn up to put a fire out and yet they are the people that have come under the most scrutiny so far.” Planning and decision-making involved in the refurbishment of Grenfell using combustible materials might not be examined until the beginning of next year – by which time, the firefighters’ union argues, public attention will have waned.When writer Peter Pomerantsev was a teenager, he was sent to one of the European Schools, which count Boris Johnson among their alumnae.

At night, however, most of the luxury apartments remain in darkness and the basement casinos are eerily deserted.Panamanian real estate was a favourite investment of the boliburgues, Venezuelans who grew rich on the back of their political connections to the late president Hugo Chávez and his successor Nicolás Maduro.But in the wake of the Panama Papers scandal it has become increasingly hard to launder money through the country, cutting off a potential exit route for those looking to cut loose from Maduro’s embattled regime.“The Panamanian real estate boom began in 2005 – the Colombians came first, then the Venezuelans,” says Ernesto Gonzalez, an investment advisor for Dproperty, a local property broker. “They would sometimes buy up seven or eight luxury apartments in the same building and leave them vacant but the market has slowed dramatically in recent years, especially after the Panama Papers.”The April 2016 publication of 11 million documents taken from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca shed light on the mechanisms by which Chavistas built their wealth.As part of the Panama Papers investigation Venezuelan journalists Ewald Scharfenburg and Alfredo Meza sifted through hundreds of thousands of documents relating to more than 700 of their compatriots.“Chávez, with good reason, was suspicious of the country’s traditional business elite, so he created a new one,” says Scharfenburg. “Through its government connections the new elite amassed huge fortunes, both by over-billing state entities and through preferential access to dollars, which became a huge opportunity for self-enrichment.”In 2003 Chávez pegged the bolivar, the national currency, to the US dollar. As the bolivar devalued in real terms, huge arbitrage options opened up for iniduals and companies who could buy dollars at the official rate and sell them on the black market, often at over 100 times their purchase value.With a dollarized economy, visa-free travel and a financial sector with a habit of turning a blind eye, Panama – along with Miami, Spain and Nicaragua – became a favourite destination for offshore investment and, for a while, the boligburgues could lead their often ostentatious retirements undisturbed.Juan Guaidó – the opposition leader leader now recognized as Venezuela’s legitimate leader by dozens of western governments – has offered amnesty to Venezuelan soldiers who defect. US security adviseer John Bolton has suggested that Maduro and his inner circle should take “a long, quiet retirement … on a nice beach somewhere far from Venezuela.”But the boliburgues can be forgiven for not taking Bolton at his word. Senior Panamanian sources told  that since early 2017 the US’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) had been working with the Lima Group of 12 Latin American countries and Canada to identify illegal offshore assets belonging to members of the Maduro regime.In November Miami courts ruled that Alejandro Andrade, Chavez’s private secretary turned head of treasury, had accepted $1bn in bribes for providing access to preferential currency rates as part of a money laundering scam. He received a 10-year sentence and his Florida mansion, collection of classic cars and 17 racehorses are to be auctioned by the US treasury.“The Andrade case was an inflection point,” says Scharfenburg. “It was assumed he had done a deal with US authorities to escape prosecution. Since 2016, the US’s approach has changed, the boliburgues know they are under vigilance and they are increasingly trying to move their cash to places like Turkey and the UAE.”In October federal courts also gave a 10-year sentence to Matthias Krull, a Panama-based banker who allegedly managed accounts for 500 Venezuelan clients, for his role in a scheme to wash funds from the Venezuelan national oil company through the exchange rate system. Providing evidence as part of his plea deal, Krull implicated Raul Gorrín, the man responsible for turning opposition media network Globovisión into pro-Maduro outlet and three sons-in-law of the president. US prosecutors unsealed an indictment against Gorrín for money-laundering and bribery in November.In a separate case uncovered by the Panama Papers investigation, Spanish authorities arrested Claudia Patricia Díaz Guillén and her husband Adrían Velásquez. He had been employed as Chavez’s bodyguard while she had been his personal nurse before replacing Andrade as head of treasury in 2011. The pair are accused of pocketing over $4bn through an exotic blend of Seychelles listed shell companies and Andorran banks. Diaz Guillén and Velásquez claim the case against them is politically motivated.In Panama, authorities are cooperating with FinCEN and working hard to clean up a reputation left tarnished by the Panama Papers. On 6 February the country introduced tougher penalties for tax evasion.“The environment has changed significantly,” says Dulcidio de la Guardia, Minister of Finance from 2014 to July 2018. “Panama has worked hard to introduce a world class anti-money laundering framework and it is far harder for both local and foreigners to open bank accounts.”Since 2016 Panama’s banks have ceased to open accounts to iniduals with companies listed in Venezuela due to concerns about exposure to possible corruption.As authorities in the US, Panama and Spain home in on the Chavistas’ errant billions, those close to the regime are running out of time to secure their foreign assets. In any future rebuilding of the Venezuelan economy a strong emphasis is likely to be put on recovering stolen assets according to Pedro Armada, a Panama City based investigator and forensic accountant.“As Venezuela enters ‘end-game’ we are likely to see an acceleration in the rate at which ill-gotten funds are expatriated,” says Armada. “The noose is tightening on the boliburgues.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22400dddcc47e8c456fb7984c11ffc6aa3daf3b5/0_66_5180_3108/master/5180.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f06b3e780858ab26b69f4b32fc6d343","title":"polish israel visit holocaust","story":"Polish officials may cancel their planned trip to Israel, the head of the prime minister’s office, Michał Dworczyk, has said after the media reported remarks by Israel’s prime minister suggesting Polish complicity in the Holocaust.The prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, previously called off his visit to Israel, with the foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, to go instead. However, the entire visit could be cancelled as the diplomatic row deepened.Dworczyk pointed to a “disgraceful” statement by the Israeli foreign minister’s department. “In the light of this statement, any participation of representatives of the Polish state in the V4 summit in Israel is under a very big question mark,” he told state ratio.The V4 summit was a planned gathering of leaders from Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary.The acting foreign minister told Israel’s Army Radio on Monday that he wanted to maintain good relations with Poland, but he repeated his earlier remarks.Israel Katz said: “Historical truth cannot be changed.

Those who complete third level have a better chance of getting a job and of being paid well for it.The figures indicate there is also a strong argument for graduates in certain fields to continue their educational journey to postgraduate level and beyond.It is clear from this report that the ongoing economic recovery is leading to much improving employment prospects for graduates.Overall, a total of 78 per cent of graduates are in employment or due to start a job nine months after leaving college.The remainder are mostly in either further education or travelling just 5 per cent are seeking employment. Of those at work, some 90 per cent are finding work at home.While the data in this year’s report isn’t strictly comparable to last year due to a change in methodology, one thing is clear: these are the kind of indicators we last saw during the the heady days of the economic boom.For those who stay on in education to master’s or doctoral degree level, there is a significant earnings premium.Postgraduate qualificationsEarning data shows students who stay on in college to study for postgraduate qualifications such as PhDs stand to earn about €8,000 more than than average graduates.Jim Miley, director general of the Irish Universities Association, says the outcomes confirms the “clear added value” of higher education for society and for iniduals, in terms of both employment opportunities and graduate salaries.Given the earnings boost of which third level affords, some might argue that it also vindicates our policy of sending ever more school-leavers into higher education.However, as last week’s study by the HEA shows, this doesn’t always hold true.There are alarming dropout rates in some colleges and courses, especially those with low CAO points in computing and engineering.There is a strong argument that some may fare better in more hands-on options such as further education or apprenticeships, which also offer starting salaries on a par with college graduates.If there are any alarm bells in this report, they seem to be ringing for arts and humanities graduates.They have consistently recorded lower earnings and employment levels – at all levels of qualification – although many are progressing on to further studies or training.Many also argue that due to the nature of arts and humanities degrees it just takes a bit longer to find work linked to your qualification.There is also a question mark over the quality of work in some areas. For example, despite high levels of employment, many education graduates say they are engaged in temporary, substitute or part-time teaching in Ireland.Notwithstanding this, the picture painted in this latest report is overwhelmingly positive: starting salaries are rising, employment rates are climbing and emigration is going down.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":null,"title":"employment rates for college graduates at boom time levels","story":"The vast majority of college graduates are opting to stay and find work at home, new figures show. Overall, some 78 per cent of graduates from the class of 2017 were working nine months after graduating, figures not seen since the height of the economic boom.The remainder were in further education or training (14 per cent), seeking work (5 per cent) or engaged in other activities, such as travel (4 per cent).Of those at work, some 90 per cent found employment within Ireland on average starting salaries of €33,574.In a boost for the economy, the bulk of international students (62 per cent) are also choosing to stay and find work here.Earning data shows that students who stay on in college to study for postgraduate qualifications such as PhDs stand to earn about €8,000 more than than average graduates.Overall, the mean salary for an honours degree graduate is about €29,600.This rose to €40,849 for graduates with master’s degrees and €45,325 for those with doctoral degrees.Interestingly, graduates with lower levels of qualifications – such as higher certificates or ordinary degrees – earned slightly more than honours degree graduates.For example, the average starting salary for a graduate with a higher certificate was €32,845, while it rose to €34,348 for an ordinary degree holder.When broken down by geography, the highest average salaries were reported by those employed in the Dublin area.Average starting salaries in the capital were €34,153, while the lowest average salaries were in the Border area at €28,846, a gap of more than €5,000There is also evidence of a gender gap in salaries, with men earning more than women.This is despite the fact that women are more likely to secure higher grades at the end of college.Men reported earning €35,650, on average, while women reported earning €31,670, about €4,000 less.While this corresponds to a gender pay gap of 11 per cent, this reduces to about 4 per cent when the field of study and age is controlled for.The figures also indicate there is a premium attached to graduating from a university compared with an institute of technology.University graduates earn €2,676 more a year on average compared with institute of technology graduates, when controlling for the field of study.However, there was little difference in employment outcomes based on the institution attended.University graduates and institute of technology graduates were just as likely to be employed (78 per cent).Also, male and female employment prospects were similar with 78 per cent of graduates of each gender employed nine months after graduating.The survey also contains a detailed analysis of education graduates for the first time, broken down into early years, primary and post-primary.Of these groups, those in early years earned the least, typically €20-25,000. Primary and post-primary teaching graduates earned more, typically €30-35,000.Employment rates were particularly good for all education graduates. Primary teaching graduates were the most likely to be working (96 per cent), followed by post-primary (89 per cent) and early years (84 per cent).An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3797155.1550432423!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"metrolink route to be published within weeks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA revised route for the Dublin Link rail line will be published within weeks, the National Transport Authority has said.A revised route for the Dublin Link rail line will be published within weeks, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has said.This follows a week where the chief executive of Fingal County Council Paul Reid called for the northside section of the line to be built independently of the southside leg, due to ongoing delays in determining the route south of Ranelagh. South Dublin County Council also called for the line to be erted to Rathfarnham instead of running to Sandyford.It emerged last December that an application to build the rail line from Swords to Sandyford is unlikely to be made until 2020 due to delays in revising the route for the southside section.Transport authorities had been due to announce the redesigned route of the line last August, but postponed their decision, and had been expected to publish the route details by last November.However, publication of the revised route was further delayed to allow time to design an extension of the underground section past Ranelagh in south Dublin.The additional tunnelling was likely to add more than €100 million to the cost of the €3 billion line.The revised alignment is now expected to be published in early March, the NTA has confirmed.Preferred routeThe preferred route of the metro line, which combines the previously planned  North from Swords to the city centre with an upgrade of the Luas Green line between Charlemont and Sandyford, was first announced last March.However, in the subsequent months the transport authorities came under pressure from senior politicians – including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy – as well as the GAA to alter the route.The route had involved the use of Na Fianna GAA club and adjoining school pitches on St Mobhi Road in Glasnevin for a major construction site. Mr Varadkar last May said the proposals would cause “enormous damage” to the schools and sports clubs that use the Glasnevin lands.It had also required the closure of a road linking Rathmines and Ranelagh in south Dublin. Mr Murphy asked the transport bodies to scrap plans to close the level crossing from Dunville Avenue to Beechwood Road in Ranelagh, which would force motorists into a 1.2km detour.The transport authorities initially prepared two solutions for the Dunville Avenue crossing one involved the construction of a rail bridge over the road, the other would see the construction of a railway “cutting” allowing the train to travel under the road. These options would have added in the region of €25-€35 million to the line’s €3 billion budget.However, these options were not acceptable locally, and the authorities are planning to extend the tunnel, which was due to end at the current Luas Charlemont stop north of Ranelagh, south, past the Dunville Avenue junction.Lands belonging to Home Farm Football Club are expected to be used instead of the GAA lands.In the city centre residents in the College Gate apartment block on Townsend Street are fighting against the proposed demolition of their 70 homes, and the Markievicz leisure centre underneath the apartments.The block was last March earmarked for demolition for the construction of an underground station for the line.While in Milltown, one of the most expensive fee-paying schools in the State, Alexandra College, has said it will resist attempts to close an entrance and take some land for the line."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3797181.1550434238!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bam gave varadkar 2 hour ultimatum to clarify lowballing remark","story":"During leaders\u0027 questions in the Dail on Tuesday 12th February, the Taoiseach made comments on companies submitting low bids, only to raise prices afterwards. Video: Oireachtas TV  \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: It is not expected he will reply to Bam chief executive Theo Cullinane’s letter. Photograph:  Gareth Chaney CollinsBam Ireland, the construction firm building the national children’s hospital, gave Taoiseach Leo Varadkar a 2¼-hour ultimatum to back the company in the row over cost overruns at the project.The company’s chief executive, Theo Cullinane, wrote to Mr Varadkar last Wednesday demanding that he clarify his Dáil remarks disparaging some building contractors or else Bam would consider “all our options”.The letter was sent to the Taoiseach at 3.45pm and cited a 6pm deadline for the Taoiseach to clarify his remarks about companies that have been “lowballing” contracts.Mr Varadkar has not replied to the letter, but a spokesman has said he was not directly referencing any specific company in his Dáil remarks.Sources say the tone of the letter and the manner in which a public statement was demanded of the Taoiseach at short notice has caused annoyance in Government circles. It is not expected that Mr Varadkar will reply to Mr Cullinane’s letter.The Government has engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to look into why the cost of the hospital has risen from €800 million in 2014 to €1.7 billion now.Bam last August submitted €200 million in additional claims for its work on the hospital, but this was reduced to €60 million through the involvement of an independent expert helping to determine the final price. The total cost overrun since last year is €450 million.Reputation ‘damage’The Taoiseach last week said “there are one or two contractors who, quite frankly, I would not like to see get a public contract again in this State”.The following day, Mr Cullinane wrote saying the remarks were widely understood to refer to Bam, adding: “It has been seriously damaging to our reputation.”The remarks came at a time when Bam said it was showing “considerable forbearance in managing a misunderstood process” at the children’s hospital “and in terms of making comment on misinformation being put in the public domain about our conduct”. “For the Taoiseach to make an ambiguous statement of this nature under Dáil privilege is extremely inappropriate and damaging,” Mr Cullinane said.He said the company had made a huge contribution to Ireland over 60 years and employs over 2,500 people, “for whom this issue has serious implications”.He called on the Taoiseach to immediately clarify he was not referring to Bam in the Dáil and that it makes a “welcome and significant contribution” including in the children’s hospital where the company is “in full compliance with all its obligations”.Step-down offerWhen the Taoiseach failed to respond publicly as demanded, Bam issued a statement on Friday saying it would step down from constructing the hospital if the development board wanted it to do so.Bam declined to elaborate further on this statement on Sunday, or to say whether the company would be prepared to appear before one of the Oireachtas committees investigating the cost overrun.Asked whether Mr Varadkar was referring to Bam in his remarks last week, his spokesman repeated: “The Taoiseach did not reference any specific company in the Dáil.”Minister for Health Simon Harris said at the weekend that the Government did not intend to retender the project. He also did not believe Bam’s name had been “blackened” or that the Taoiseach needed to clarify his remarks.Retendering would add up to 1½ years to the completion of the project and at least €150 million in costs, according to the development board. Bam would likely be due a contract-break fee if asked to walk away from the project.Mr Harris faces a Sinn Féin motion of no confidence in the Dáil on Wednesday over his handling of the hospital cost overrun, which he is expected to survive. The PwC report is due at the end of March.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Nobel laureate\u0026rsquos comments on race \u0026lsquodo not reflect\u0026rsquo college\u0026rsquos values, says authoritiesDemonstrations to take place at Intreo offices on Monday over demands on pension rightsDriver was sole occupant in incident in NaasHolles Street says new posts available only to consultants willing to carry out terminationsRevised route of Swords to Sandyford rail line due in early March, NTA saysODCE chief to say factors extending \u0026lsquowell beyond\u0026rsquo watchdog contributed to acquittalPakistan-born Sajjad Hussain hopes to be first Asian person to win local authority seatTuath Housing to create 22 units at Ellis Court on Benburb Street for housing listIrish embassy received 55,000 emails about passports in two months last yearSuspicions from Scouting Ireland review that child abuse files \u0026lsquowent missing\u0026rsquoMassive backlog means women have to wait up to 27 weeks for resultsMater\u0026rsquos mission policy urges staff to take part in \u0026lsquothe healing ministry of Christ\u0026rsquoAn Daingean dispute re-emerges over official name given to new local electoral areaFlorist Michelle Moloney says wards banning flowers impacts on patients and business"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3797176.1550434215!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"london embassy stretched by passport demand ahead of brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe passport ision of the Irish embassy in London has warned that it is ‘under pressure’ due to the rising number of applications ahead of Brexit. Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe The passport ision of the Irish embassy in London has warned that it is “stretched and working under pressure” and that staffing levels “are not sufficient” to meet the rising number of applications ahead of Brexit.Correspondence between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the embassy, released under the Freedom of Information Act, indicates that there has been rising pressure on officials at the embassy despite assertions from the Dublin passport office that a new online system is speeding up the system.Between September and November last year, the embassy’s passport office received more than 55,000 emails, including queries on technical issues when applying online for passports, failed online applications, undelivered passports and damaged passports, the documents show.A report sent from London to the department’s management board in November warned that there had “not been a major drop off in the number of UK applications to the counter in Cromwell Road despite online renewals”.In an email dated November 27th, 2018, Irish Ambassador to the UK Adrian O’Neill said the move to online applications would not “necessarily result in a commensurate freeing up of resources in London”.In another email, a passport officer writes that “extensive media coverage of Brexit” is adding to the embassy’s workload and that requests from the Irish community in Britain were increasing.The UK is due to leave the European Union on March 29th and as it stands, there is little clarity as to what its future relationship with the bloc will be. This has increased interest among people living in Britain with Irish links in obtaining an Irish passport in order to allow them continued full access to the EU.One in six claimThe number of passport applications received by the embassy has almost doubled in recent years, rising from 46,229 in 2015 to 91,623 in the 11 months to the end of last November.It is estimated that one in six people in Britain could be entitled to claim Irish citizenship.To date, around 20 per cent of those who are eligible to claim Irish citizenship appear to have done so. However, an increase in this number to 40 or 60 per cent would require an 18 to 36 per cent increase in overall staffing levels in 2019, according to the Department.A total of 98,544 people living in England, Scotland and Wales applied for Irish passports last year, up 22 per cent on 2017. Last year, 862,415 passports and identity cards were issued.So far this year, 10,833 people in Britain have been issued Irish passports, up from 7,076 during the same period last year. Some 10,796 people in Northern Ireland have been issued passports, up from 7,519 last year. A total of 92,301 people have received Irish passports so far this year, up from 73,894 during the first six weeks of last year.A departmental forecast estimates that 2.1 million people are eligible for immediate applications – 800,000 in Britain and 1.3 million in the North – up to 2023. It cautions that about 4.4 per cent of the 1.2 million UK citizens living across the EU may also be eligible for Irish passports.While a decision last May to redirect all postal applications for passports to the Cork office had somewhat reduced the workload, the embassy underlined that it was still receiving 60 per cent of all British postal applications.The embassy requests that the department arrange for at least three temporary clerical officers to assist the embassy in its passport requests. It warns that staffing levels “are not sufficient” to cover the “blocks of work” in the passport ision.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.Aerogels are a material made up of air that is stuck within a network made of a solid medium, such as ceramic, metal or carbon.Ceramic aerogels can be incredibly lightweight, but still able to endure demanding environments. However, they are usually very brittle and easily degrade, making them hard to use as insulation and limiting their adoption.However, the new ceramic aerogel has been created using atomically thin sheets of a substance known as\u0026nbsphexagonal boron nitride. That was carefully engineered into a new material that does not expand outwards when it is compressed or heated up, unlike other similar materials.It then succeeded in a whole host of tests, including experiments that heated and cooled it rapidly. The aerogel hardly changed at all, the authors right, and did not lose any strength.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some pastors take worshippers for full immersion baptisms in the cold of the Thames Estuary. Others believe that when congregants suddenly start speaking in unknown languages it marks the presence of the Holy Spirit.But the researchers from the University of Roehampton found things that many churches have in common, including a drive for professional advancement, a commitment to spend three hours or more at Sunday service and typically very loud worship.“That is how we express our joy and gratitude to God,” says Andrew Adeleke, a senior pastor at the House of Praise, one of the biggest African churches in Southwark, in a former theatre.“The church is not supposed to be a graveyard,“ Adeleke says. “It is supposed to be a temple of celebration and worship and the beauty is to be able to express our love to God, even when things are not perfect in our lives.”For some, the noise from amplified services is a problem, leading to complaints to local authorities from residents.But many churches face bigger challenges than unhappy neighbours: some provide food for people struggling to make ends meet, or work with young people at risk of recruitment by gangs.With clubs, churches and motorcycles, Berlin becomes home for migrantsAndrew Rogers, who led the University of Roehampton researchers, says pastors have to juggle retaining the churches’ African identity while appealing to children of first-generation immigrants, many of whom have never lived outside Britain.They typically have a more liberal world view which can be hard to reconcile with conservative Pentecostal teachings.Rogers recalls speaking to one pastor who lamented he was unable to talk about religious miracles to his children.“If the church doesn’t adapt, then they are going to leave and look elsewhere,” Rogers says.Reporting by William Schomberg, ReutersWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Like many other entrepreneurs, she is spending a lot of time in London, masterminding the expansion of Karma in the UK.\u0026nbspSince it launched in London in February 2018, 80,000 users have signed up to click and collect surplus food from delis and restaurants for half price. On any day, users can browse nearby restaurants and cafes for surplus salads, pastries and full meals to buy and collect before closing.\u0026nbspAll that waste has been good for business: Karma is working with 600 independent retailers in London and makes money by taking a cut of sales. Food waste costs businesses in the UK around\u0026nbsp£20bn annually, according to Wrap, the food waste charity –\u0026nbspthe equivalent of more than £300 per citizen.In September, 90 organisations signed a commitment to reduce food waste through the food chain, from field to fork, by working with suppliers and engaging with customers alike. Supermarkets are increasingly seeing apps as part of the solution.\u0026nbspIn November last year, Karma teamed up with appliance manufacturer Electrolux to test out a smart refrigerator for grocery stores. In a trial in Stockholm, users signed up to buy reduced-price chilled goods that would have otherwise gone to waste, unlocking a connected fridge at the entrance to a supermarket with a QR code.Karma has raised €18m\u0026nbsp(£16m) from investors to expand the number of retailers it works with in London and is planning a test launch in Paris in 2019. But Bernadotte says the app works just as well in small towns with just one or two retailers as it does in big cities. She says: “It’s about matching supply and demand.”It’s also about beating the competition. The number of food waste apps on the market has multiplied in the last decade, fuelled by environmental pressure from consumers and industry bodies. Winnow, which launched in London is 2013, provides chefs in commercial kitchens a set of scales to weigh food and measure how much is thrown away. The app can then assess the value of what is being lost, with the idea that restaurants adapt their menus.\u0026nbspOther apps are based on Bernadotte’s notion of matching supply and demand. Tessa Cook co-founded Olio\u0026nbspin the UK in 2015. The app now connects supply and demand for surplus food within communities in 32 countries, with 75 per cent of food listed picked up within 24 hours.\u0026nbspOlio\u0026nbspcurrently makes money by charging business for its Food Waste Heroes Programme, in which a group of volunteers rescue unsold food from businesses and add it to the app. But its core business is connecting people within communities who may only need one red onion, for example, and have another two to give away. Olio\u0026nbspattracted $6m\u0026nbsp(£4.7m) in Series A funding in July led by Octopus Ventures, which was attracted by the value of connecting people through the app.\u0026nbspKarma’s major competition comes Too Good To Go, an app founded in Copenhagen in 2016. It\u0026nbsphas raised a total of €16m\u0026nbspto expand\u0026nbspin Europe. Too Good To Go founder Mette Lykke knows a thing or two about seeing a gap in the market and scaling a business. She previously co-founded Endomondo, an app for tracking and sharing workouts. It sold to Under Armour for $85m\u0026nbspin 2015.\u0026nbsp“The reality is that it’s standard practice for food businesses to throw away perfectly edible food,” she says. “We give them the flexibility to offer up anything that’s still good to eat and sell it to consumers through the app at a discounted price. It’s a win for retailers, because they reduce waste, acquire customers and increase revenue\u0026nbspit’s a win for consumers who get great food for a reduced price –\u0026nbspand it’s obviously a win for the environment.”In France, Too Good To Go is campaigning for Carrefour, the French retail company, to change its food labels from “best before” to “best before, not bad after”. The campaign comes after Tesco scrapped “best before” labels in the UK in October 2018\u0026nbspon more than 100 products. In its native Denmark, Too Good To Go is also working with the country’s minister for education to create webinars to educate children about how to reduce waste at home.\u0026nbspBut its main business is comes from taking a cut of surplus food sales from restaurants and cafes – with a plan to save 20 million\u0026nbspmeals by the end of 2019. Bernadotte says the main difference between the apps is that Karma users know exactly what food they are picking up, which can help with allergies and dietary requirements. Many of the meals on Too Good To Go are listed as “the magic bag”, a mixed bag of any surplus food that a restaurant might otherwise throw away.\u0026nbspHarriet Jenkins is chief operating officer for Detox Kitchen, a health-food home delivery service that has two delis in London. Detox Kitchen switched from using Too Good To Go to Karma after it was contacted by the latter app when it entered the London market in 2018. “Karma was working with a good number of stores and slightly bigger numbers, so we thought we’d experiment with them,” Jenkins says.6 easy ways to prevent food waste at homeDetox Kitchen had long been interested in reducing food waste in its kitchens, but had found it difficult to strike deals with charities because the delis couldn’t guarantee a set amount of waste to make a worthwhile pickup at the end of the day. Through Karma, they could list as much or as little food for half price to be picked up by customers. In the first week of December last year, Detox Kitchen sold 100 units through Karma, raising £230.\u0026nbsp“It’s not a huge boost to revenue, but it’s not about making money – it’s about not losing money by throwing this stuff away,” Jenkins says. “Anything that is raising the profile of our brand is good for us.”With 700 retailers in London, Karma hasn’t even begun to test the potential of the model, according to Bernadotte. “We started off with restaurants and big hotel chains, and now we’re ramping up with grocery stores, supermarkets and school kitchens,” she says. “I haven’t found anyone who doesn’t have any food waste.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

No prizes for guessing where this is…From one mighty ocean to another – ships passing through the Panama canalAstronaut Tim Peake previously revealed the damage that orbital junk can cause spacecraft, when he shared an image of a chipped window panel on board the International Space Station in 2016.It is believed that something as small as a paint chip could have caused the damage, as it hurtled towards the International Space Station.When in full operation, scientists aim to make the harpoon fire at debris up to 30 metres away.Engineers back on Earth are still trying to work out how the system can be used to target moving objects.A previous RemoveDEBRIS\u0026nbspexperiment demonstrated how a net could be used to catch potentially dangerous pieces of rubbish orbiting the Earth. Next, the group are expected to test the drag sail part of the test on 12 March.\u0026nbsp“Successful in-space demonstration of the harpoon technology is a significant step towards solving the growing issue of space debris, said Chris Burgess, Harpoon Lead Engineer at Airbus Defence and Space.Professor Guglielmo Aglietti, director of the Surrey Space Centre at the University of Surrey, added: “This is RemoveDEBRIS’ most demanding experiment and the fact that it was a success is testament to all involved.\u0026nbspThe RemoveDEBRIS project provides strong evidence of what can be achieved with the power of collaboration – pooling together the experience across industry and the research field to achieve something truly remarkable.”Additional reporting from agencies.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Several celebrities have pleaded directly with Mr Dorsey for an edit button feature that would allow them to change the text of the original tweet.In June 2018, reality TV star Kim Kardashian West claimed to have almost persuaded the Twitter boss, prompting an angry reaction from many Twitter users.What Twitter\u0027s Jack Dorsey said about Elon Musk is the last strawJack Dorsey: Mark Zuckerberg tried to feed me goat he shot with laserTwitter CEO won\u0027t say if Trump would be banned for ordering murderI had a very good convo with @jack this weekend at Kanye\u0027s bday and I think he really heard me out on the edit button, she tweeted.\u0026nbspOne of the most liked responses to her tweet came from Twitter user Beau Sloane,\u0026nbspwho pointed out the flaws of such a feature.Guys if we get an edit button on Twitter, it would defeat the entire purpose of the app, he tweeted. Think about how corrupt it would become! People could change conversations from the past and twist words!Mr Dorsey told the Goldman Sachs audience clarifications added to a tweet would appear alongside any further interactions with the original tweet, such as a retweet.You wouldn\u0027t be able to retweet the original tweet, for instance, he said.\u0026nbspYou would just show the clarification, so it always carries around with it that context.

Therefore any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the six months that should be remaining for travel to most countries in Europe.The \u0027blue\u0027 passport, like Brexit, is an international embarrassmentCombining these two rule changes means that\u0026nbspthere are some passports out there which could be rejected even though they expire 14 months and 29 days after the date of travel.\u0026nbspHowever, these rules do not apply when travelling to Ireland. To try to eliminate any confusion, the government website has a new passport checker service to see whether\u0026nbspyou should renew your documents or not.If the UK leaves with a deal, travel to the EU should\u0026nbspremain the same as now until at least 31 December 2020.That would mean\u0026nbspUK passports would\u0026nbspbe valid for travel anywhere in the Schengen area (the vast majority of EU countries as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) up to and including the expiry date.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

In some countries British spending power has weakened -\u0026nbsp£500 in US dollars today buys almost £50 less than it did in spring last year.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Further votes may take place the following day.However many, including Sir Keir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, believe Ms May\u0026nbspis planning to delay the meaningul vote until after the European Council meeting on 21 and 22 March, even if an extension to the Article 50 deadline of 29 March\u0026nbspis offered.Labour MP David Lammy said: “It is in those final days that we have the biggest chance to convince MPs to give this decision back to the public.”What will the march be demanding?The key demand is that\u0026nbspany Brexit deal should be put to a public vote for final approval.“Instead of letting Theresa May kick the can down the road until the March 29 deadline, hundreds of thousands of people will march on parliament offering a solution to a crisis that threatens our rights, our living standards and our environment,” said former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas.One proposal for avoiding a no-deal Brexit and securing a second referendum involves tabling\u0026nbspan amendment\u0026nbspin the last week before 29 March.MPs would then approve her deal only if it was subject to a public vote.Where\u0026nbspwill the march take place?The march is set to begin at 12pm, or “high noon”, on Saturday 23 March, on London’s Park Lane.Organisers from the People’s Vote campaign\u0026nbsphave not yet released full details of the route but the march is due to end at Parliament Square with a “mass rally and keynote speeches”.Who will be joining the march?Several leading politicians\u0026nbspincluding Caroline Lucas,\u0026nbspDavid Lammy, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Conservative MP Anna Soubry, and the leaders of the SNP and Plaid Cymru in Westminster, Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts, have already confirmed their support.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspis supporting the march and encouraging readers to attend.The organisers are hoping to widen their appeal beyond those who have previously supported the People’s Vote and Final Say campaigns.\u0026nbspThe Independent‘s petition calling on the prime minister to give the people a final say on Brexit has attracted well over 1.1 million sigantures.“The only way forward out of this Brexit mess is through a People’s Vote,” said Sir Vince.For more details about the Put It To The People march\u0026nbsp– and to sign up – please visit\u0026nbsppeoples-vote.ukmarchFor updates on what’s going on with Brexit, you can register here to receive our new Brexit in Brief newsletter and other benefits.

Jeremy Corbyn and those around him are on the wrong side on so many international issues, from Russia to Syria to Venezuela. A Corbyn Labour government would threaten our national security\u0026nbspand international alliances.Ann Coffey, the Stockport MP,\u0026nbspis next up.\u0026nbspShe\u0026nbspsays Labour is no longer a broad church - any criticism of the leadership is responded to with abuse and accusations of treachery.\u0026nbspShe says antisemitism in Labour is rife and that Jeremy Corbyn has succeeded in\u0026nbspchanging this party beyond recognition\u0026nbspShe finishes\u0026nbspby saying:\u0026nbspLoyalty cannot be an end in itself, so I leave the party with great sadness but in hope that we, as a independent group, can start to change a political system in which people feel they have no voice.Gavin Shuker, MP for Luton South, is now speaking.\u0026nbspHe says the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn has turned its back on the British public - their hopes and ambitions.Next up is Angela Smith, MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShe says she comes from a staunchly Labour family that believed in helping people to get on.\u0026nbspShe says:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Most people are like my family. They do not want to be patronised by left wing intellectuals who think that being poor and working class is a state of grace.Chris Leslie, MP for Nottingham East, says the Labour Party has been hijacked by the machine politics of the hard left.\u0026nbspHe says British politics is now well and truly broken and that he is unable to advocate a government led by Jeremy Corbyn.\u0026nbspHe says MPs have a duty to say publicly\u0026nbsphow irresponsible it would be to allow\u0026nbspthis leader of the opposition to take the office of prime minister of the United Kingdom.Luciana Berger says her values have not changed, but that they have been consistently undermined and attacked as the current Labour Party refuses to put the national interest before party interest.\u0026nbspShe says Labour is institutionally antisemitic and that the party leadership has wilfully and repeatedly failed to address hatred against Jewish people in its ranks.\u0026nbspShe is leaving behind a culture of bullying, bigotry and intimidation, she adds.The Labour MPs have entered the room.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLuciana Berger, Liverpool Wavertree MP, is speaking. She says the MPs have made\u0026nbsp a painful but necessary decision.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFrom today, we will all sit in parliament as a new, independent group of MPs,\u0026nbspshe says.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn refused to comment on reports of a Labour split when leaving his house this morning\u0026nbspArriving in Brussels for talks with EU foreign ministers, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has called for trust and vision on both sides, insisting there is a way through the impasse on Brexit.He said it was a critical period and the message I am coming with is a very simple one, which is there is a way through, we know how we can get a majority in Parliament.\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s MP for Hove, Peter Kyle, who has been a regular critic of the direction Mr Corbyn is taking the party, said he would not be among those making announcements about their future but\u0026nbsp rejected the idea of forcing MPs to sign a loyalty pledge of the kind currently being circulated by the pro-Corbyn Momentum group.He told Today: I would never sign a pledge of loyalty. I think leadership should be compelling not compulsive. I\u0027ve worked with great leaders in the past and I\u0027ve been drawn to them. That\u0027s the point of leadership.Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA union, urged Labour MPs to stick with the party.I\u0027d urge anyone in our party thinking of bolting not to do so, he said.Brexit\u0026nbspor any other issue isn\u0027t an excuse for breaking away. Labour is the only show in town for creating a fairer Britain. Our voters need our MPs to be made of sterner stuff.The Tories, not Jeremy, heaped the calamity that is\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon our country and on our neighbours.\u0026nbspTheresa May had made clear that she wanted to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement to secure legal reassurance on the backstop, said Mr Lidington, though he accepted that would be very difficult.Whenever I have sat down with the Prime Minister in private, I have heard nothing from her other than an absolute determination to get the right deal for this country, for every part of this country, for every sector of industry.It is a determination that is driving her forward. She believes, rightly, that it is a democratic duty to deliver the result of the 2016 referendum, but at the same time to protect jobs, investment and living standards of ordinary families up and down this country. That\u0027s what she\u0027s about, that\u0027s what I\u0027m about.David Lidington has dismissed suggestions on Today that last week\u0027s visits to Brussels by ministers including himself and\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspSecretary Stephen Barclay were no more than courtesy calls.They are a lot more than courtesy calls. It was a very useful discussion about the politics both within the United Kingdom and within the EU27 and a scoping-out of what was possible.Labour\u0026nbspleader Jeremy Corbyn left his home in Islington, north London at around 8.15am and got into a waiting car.When asked by reporters whether he is expecting resignations, or if his party is in trouble, Mr Corbyn replied, with a slightly irritated tone: Good morning, how nice it is to see you all here.A no-deal Brexit will lead virtually instantaneously to price rises on popular food products in shops, the head of Birds Eye in the UK has warned.The frozen food specialist\u0027s managing director for the UK and Ireland, Wayne Hudson, said manufacturers would have to pass tariffs of up to 20 per cent\u0026nbspon to retailers, who would themselves have to decide how much of the extra cost to pass on to shoppers.Mr Hudson said the uncertainty around Brexit was seriously delaying our ambitious plans for continued growth and imposing additional costs, with four of the company\u0027s senior executives focused entirely on contingency planning.Please allow a moment for the liveblog to loadWe’ll tell you what’s true.

The truth is that Meghan is not remotely being hunted by photographers and enjoys extraordinary freedoms.The paparazzi do not stalk her like they did the Princess of Wales — although they were often tipped off about where Diana would be.Snappers were told  when she was going for lunch  with a friend, dressed up to the nines, or out for a night on the town in a sizzling frock. She had her favourite writers and her favoured photographers.But the only paparazzi pictures ever to have been published of Meghan were taken when the story first broke that she was romantically linked with Harry.This was a genuine news story. But because their media minders at Kensington Palace refused to issue an official photo of the couple together, they had created a market for one, and every paparazzo was desperate to get the first photo of them together.Since then, in all her public engagements, she has been closely monitored by the Palace Press team. Even her wedding pictures were so tightly controlled that just one Press agency was allowed to photograph the marriage service inside St George’s Chapel in Windsor last May.As a result, Meghan can quite happily live as a semi-private citizen in her palace.She comes and goes when and where she wants, with no photographers following her.We know precious little about the le she and Harry lead in London or at their luxury bolthole in Oxfordshire.Yes, she likes Soho Farmhouse and she writes on bananas — but that’s about it.Like everyone in the public eye, she is trolled on social media. Palace aides supposedly “spend hours” deleting hateful comments — but why bother  Why not simply ignore it  Their PR advisers hope to bypass the traditional media by controlling the photographs and stories they release.Meghan deleted her own social media accounts when she and Harry became engaged.  Perhaps the Royal Family should do the same. Instagram does not equal real le.When The Sun accurately reports about Meghan in fairly harmless stories, their frankly second-rate PR people set lawyers on us.Yet the biggest invasion of her privacy was triggered by Meghan herself, after she gave consent to friends to talk to People magazine in America last week about the awful relationship she has with  her dad.Although there have been stories about the “dficult Duchess” and the fall-out with Kate, most of her problems stem from back home in the USA.Meghan’s father Thomas Markle, her half-sister Samantha — who Meghan says she barely knows — and her cannabis-grower half-brother Thomas Jr, have only ever said disparaging things about the Duchess.I suspect that Meghan knew the letter she sent to her dad last August would be published and she used it to make sure the world knew she was disgusted with the lies being told by her family.Meanwhile, in his bid to “protect” his we, Prince Harry — once the Press photographers’ favourite among the royals —  has gone from hero to zero in his relationship with the media.I have asked twice for Meghan to meet Britain’s royal correspondents but so far it has not happened. If she did, I am sure her profile would improve.Despite being surrounded by great wealth and privilege, the young royals seem to have been seduced by the cult of victimhood.Harry talked about his anxiety and stress and Meghan is a victim of “global bullying” — whatever that means.Meghan really needs to lighten up. So does Harry.The pair of them should look across the road at Harry’s father, the Prince of Wales, and his lovely we Camilla, who has had more hostile Press coverage than any other member of  the Royal Family, including Diana.But they just worked harder and harder to win people over, and Camilla’s approval rating is now sky high and she will certainly be our Queen.Every job I have been on with Meghan she has been the star of the show. She engages brilliantly with people and is a true royal star.My main hope is that this phoney war with the media — that they started and which has now been  intensied by their friend Clooney — comes to an end before the Press loses interest.Newspapers and websites could, after all, simply stop covering Harry and Megan’s engagements, which I’m not sure would please either of them.So stick to acting, George, because there is no part for you in this royal soap opera.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So British workers, who earn an average of £, a year, are each getting richer by £ a week, every week.Not that you may have heard the good news on inflation and real wages.As ever, it was drowned out by the relentless drone of bad news stories, all trying to convince us that Britain is in an economic crash, caused by Brexit.In this fictional version of Britain’s economic health we are all getting poorer. Factories are closing like never before and jobs are drting away to the rest of the EU.Yesterday, for example, thegave prominence to a claim by a member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, Gertjan Vlieghe, that Brexit is already costing us £million a week.It was fantasy, based on Mr Vlieghe’s guess that the economy would have been two per cent larger had we not voted to leave the EU.Why should anyone believe him when the Bank of England’s economic forecasters have such a terrible record A month before the  referendum, the bank’s governor, Mark Carney, predicted Britain could fall into a “technical recession”we voted to leave.It didn’t happen — or even come close to happening.Then on Wednesday, Carney stunned many with a speech saying Brexit could usher in a golden era of “international co-operation and crossborder commerce” and even that it could be a springboard to a “new global order” of free trade.It is true that economic growth in Britain is sluggish by historical standards, but then it has been ever since the economic crash of  .But at . per cent growth in the past three months, it is outpacing Germany, where the economy was static over the same period. Italy is in recession.It is more than six years since Britain saw the economy shrink over the course of three months, and more than nine years since the economy shrank by more than two quarters in a row — the official definition of a recession.We might not be booming, in other words, but we have gone a remarkably long period without a bust.As for jobs, the unemployment rate has fallen to four per cent — the lowest since the first three months of .Employment, however, is far higher than it was then.We are in the middle of a jobs miracle, yet you would never guess this from listening to many news bulletins.Last week, we never heard the end of it when Nissan announced that it would not, after all, be building its new X-Trail model in Sunderland. You had to read a little more deeply to realise that not a single job is being lost at Britain’s Nissan plants and that the X-Trail is only being dropped because European consumers have turned against diesel.In France, by the way, the unemployment rate is . per cent and in Italy it is . per cent. So much for the notion that the Eurozone economy is powering ahead while Brexit Britain lags behind.Ever since the referendum, the economy has defied the doom-mongers. The past month has been no exception.The High Street was predicted to be a bloodbath. Yet several large chains, including Next, Dunelm and Pets At Home, reported strongly rising sales in the weeks up to Christmas.We have continued shopping after Christmas, too. Consumer spending in January was . per cent higher than a year earlier, according to Barclaycard.The stock market and housing market have both failed to crash, as many predicted they would. In fact, the FTSE  is up seven per cent this year.House prices, according to the Government’s index, are up . per cent over the past  months. That’s no rampant boom, but it is certainly nowhere near a crash.The one thing on which economists were right was that the Pound would fall after a Brexit vote.It is  per cent lower than in early .That is bad newsyou are going on a foreign holiday. Butyou have a job in a company which exports goods or services, it is a pretty good thing.By increasing exports and decreasing imports, the lower Pound is helping to reduce Britain’s trade deficit.In  we imported £billion more in goods and services than we exported. In  the deficit grew to £billion. But by , once the lower Pound had taken effect, it was £billion. However former Brexit Secretary David Davis was wrong when he pinned hopes this week of a sizeable, long-term export boost on a devaluation of the Pound.Brexit success depends on cutting taxes, trade barriers and regulatory burdens, just as Singapore has done.No matter how positive the economic data, however, there are many Remainers who simply will not accept that the economy is not crashing.They want that to happen because they want to be proved right. It is surprising the relentless tales of doom have not caused a recession by destroying consumers’ confidence.If we had taken notice of what the Eeyores were trying to tell us about economic collapse and stopped spending, recession would have become a self-fulfilling prophecy.Evidently, British consumers have the good sense to see the forecasts of doom as the anti-Brexit propaganda that they are.The economy is not roaring ahead, but strip away the gloomy headlines and there is more good news than bad.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But she was old enough to know right from wrong — to know IS were an evil army of terrorist cut-throats.Even now she has “no regrets” about supporting the Islamist butchers as they raped and massacred women and children and beheaded hostages. She seems proud she was unmoved by the sight of an enemy’s head in a bin.No remorse. No tears for the family le she abandoned in Bethnal Green. No nostalgic longing for our food, telly or shops. No hint her mind has changed.Begum simply no longer has “high hopes” IS will survive and wants taxpayers to look after her and her baby.We won’t.Security Minister Ben Wallace rightly won’t lt a finger. He says she will face justiceshe turns up. Let’s go further: Strip her of her citizenship. Stop her at the border. She is eligible to become Bangladeshi. Let her try her luck there.Begum would eradicate our way of leshe could. Why should we pay to house or police her SHAME on the MPs backing today’s mass school truancy dressed up as a “climate strike”. What is the point of it Britain has cut its greenhouse gas emissions by  per cent since , faster than almost every other major nation, even as they have risen globally.Yet schoolkids nationwide will walk out over “an alarming lack of Government leadership” on climate change.It is politically-motivated drivel.You’d expect the Green Party to support it. They’d love to scrap air and road travel and grow all Britain’s food on allotments .But why is the ambitious Lib-Dem MP Layla Moran, a former teacher, irresponsibly indulging this naïve protest and encouraging kids to skive off School heads are right to be furious.WHAT possesses leaders of our supposed allies to casually abuse Britain Holland is a fabulous place. We share much with the Dutch. Yet their PM Mark Rutte belittles us as “a weakening country on the wane . . . too small to appear on the world stage on its own”.What a time he has picked, with the EU facing recession and a populist uprising, to try to talk up staying in it.

It repeats endlessly that the withdrawal agreement is closed and that it isn’t going to reopen it.When the Brady amendment passed the House of Commons, saying Parliament would accept the dealthe backstop was replaced, the EU responded by saying they didn’t think this Parliament majority was “stable”.Thursday night’s vote helps them make that argument.As one No source laments: “We don’t want to give the Europeans a chance not to engage with us.”I understand that when the Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, dined in Brussels this week Sabine Weyand — the EU’s deputy negotiator — spent her time telling him that a customs union was the only major change available to the backstop.The EU think that Corbyn’s support for it means that a customs union could pass Parliament. I am told Barclay attempted to disabuse them of this idea.Mrs May can’t entirely escape blame for this week’s fiasco.No should have made sure that its own MPs were happy with the wording before publishing the motion.“She’s like a football team that can’t string two wins together,” complains one minister.But the Tory Brexit ultras should have paid more heed to the real-world consequences of their actions.Another effect of Thursday night’s defeat for the Government is that it increases the chances of the Cooper amendment passing on February .This would compel the Government to seek an extension to Article Mrs May hasn’t won Parliament’s support for an exit deal by March .One Cabinet minister, with close links to several of the ministers who might quit to ensure this amendment goes through, tells me it is now “much more likely” to pass.This Secretary of State complains that the Government’s defeat “makes it harder to make the argument that we should hold our nerve” as “the best evidence for holding your nerve was that the outcome would be the same as when the Brady amendment went through”.Another minister warns: “If she doesn’t come back with something cooking by the th, there’ll be trouble.”I understand those around Mrs May know they need to have shown progress by the th.One insider tells me: “If the Government doesn’t want Parliament to take control, they need to have a plan.They can’t just sit there for two weeks.”Other Cabinet ministers aren’t so sure Cooper will pass.One tells me: “I don’t think the ministers will resign, andthey don’t resign, then it doesn’t pass.”If Cooper does go through, politics will enter into an even more unpredictable phase. One May Cabinet ally is predicting a general electionthis happens.But it is hard to see how a general election could end in anything other than disaster for the Tories in these circumstances.If Mrs May is forced to ask the EU for an extension but with no Parliamentary agreement in sight, the EU is more likely to offer a long extension than a short one.I understand the view in several EU capitals is that the longer the extension, the more likely it is that the political dynamics in the UK will change.But a long extension would prolong this damaging, political uncertainty.This Government, and this Parliament’s, job is to get Brexit done. Time is running short. Both Parliament and the Government need to get their act together.But it may well be because the NHS – traditionally Labour’s strongest suit – is not the most important issue in politics right now.But that number is down to  per cent this winter, according to the pollster Ipsos Mori.The question now is whether the Tory decision to spend an extra £billion a year on the health service by  leads to a decline in public concern.But in January AE departments recorded their worst waiting times since the figures started being collected in .Matt Hancock, the new Health Secretary, is setting up a new NHS-X unit to try to bring the health service into the digital era, which would help the NHS to better use its resources.There are many things the Tories have to do to win the next election – not least, deliver Brexit – but they must also reassure voters on the NHS.Butthey can be ed they should be subject to the full force of the law.Justice must be done and must be seen to be done.Churchill wouldn’t have been Prime Minister but for the Labour Party’s willingness to serve in a government led by him.When it came to the crucial decision to fight on in , Clement Attlee and Arthur Greenwood, two Labour members of the War Cabinet, were more solid than some of Churchill’s Tory colleagues.But Attlee and Greenwood came from a very dferent Labour tradition to McDonnell: They weren’t Marxists or Trotskyists.There are some Labour MPs who are just not prepared to try to put into power people who are so outside the traditional bounds of the party.One minister likens the coming Tory leadership race to the  Grand National, when a crowded field led to a pile-up at the rd fence and the victory of the - outsider Foinavon.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Time to offer them up.Brexiteers must then hold their noses and vote for Theresa May’s deal. All other roads lead to catastrophe.They won’t get the backstop removed. We don’t believe they’ll get a No Deal exit either, and eventhey did the short-term chaos would kill their party.Instead Parliament would postpone Brexit, possibly finishing the Tories for a generation. This current purgatory would go on for months longer — maybe long enough for Remainers to reverse the referendum result.The Government would have failed in its only mission. It would instead have undermined our democracy and ensured bitter isions that would never heal.The one person unable to compromise, oddly, is the Prime Minister. Because what Brussels, Labour and Tory Remainers glibly ask of her, a permanent customs union, ALSO wrecks her party and destroys Brexit’s economic case.It was folly to expect the Tory ERG group to vote to “take No Deal off the table” on Thursday night. Logic was on their side, at least.But they need to think hard now how they will feel on March Brexit is put off and they are blamed. If they have opened the door to a toxic, anti-Semitic, anti-Western Labour rabble so crazed by ideology they cannot even allow Winston Churchill’s historic defeat of Nazism to trump his other failings.A party committed to massive tax rises, maybe even a  per cent windfall levy on anyone’s “wealth”. A party led by pension-age Marxist revolutionaries friendly to Putin, Hamas, the IRA and hard-left dictators but hard on private enterprise, job-creation and free speech.We sincerely hope Labour moderates stop dithering and resign to undermine Corbyn and McDonnell. We marvel that so many can still stomach these sinister men poised to do unimaginable harm.But eventhey can’t grasp that, Tory Brexiteers can. And we say this to them:Wake up. Look how close you now are to bringing this calamity about.WILL the Government squander the biggest potential shale gas discovery in our history It is believed there is enough under the East Midlands alone to power Britain cheaply for  years.Yet the Tories are suffocating this new industry at birth by persisting with an absurdly low limit on the level of tremor allowable when drilling. It is hundreds of times weaker than anyone can feel.A Government public information campaign must nail the lies the eco lobby has told to turn Brits off fracking.If Theresa May ever sorts Brexit, she must take charge of it personally.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it was an old-school print journalist, the brilliant Anthony Loyd of The Times, who found Begum in a Syrian refugee camp containing almost , people.Loyd’s interview with her is a gripping insight into the twisted mind of a British youngster who ran off to join IS’s murderous caliphate. And the BBC had bugger all to do with it.While BBC staffers were sipping their skinny lattes and nibbling almond croissants in Broadcasting House, a journalist from The Times got his scoop the hard way, tramping into a chaotic refugee camp in one of the most dangerous parts of the world.Why does this matter  Because this country has one of the most vibrant newspaper industries on the planet.And the bloated, over-funded BBC is KILLING it.The Cairncross Review, a Government report into the future of UK journalism, revealed this week how tax-dodging tech giants Facebook and Google, together with the publicly-funded BBC are annihilating our free Press.They have already destroyed what was once affectionately known as “the local rag”.Over the past seven years, hundreds of local papers have shut down and thousands of regional journalists have lost their jobs. , journalists worked on local newspapers in  — now it is just ,. And it is your money that bankrolls the BBC.At a time when the BBC is contem­plating ditching free TV licences for the over-s, the debate we should REALLY be having is about how much of your money we should be chucking at Auntie.We have a great newspaper industry and it is worth preserving.Because it wasn’t the BBC that broke the story of MPs fiddling their expenses — it was a newspaper . And it wasn’t the BBC that broke the story about charity Age UK receiving £million from an energy company to flog gas and electricity to pensioners — it was a newspaper .It wasn’t the BBC that dared to publish the names of the killers of Stephen Lawrence — it was a newspaper .And what was the most-read story on the BBC last year  Strictly minx Katya Jones snogging Seann Walsh  — a Sun on Sunday exclusive.The BBC, like Facebook and Google, is a parasite that lives off the flesh of real news-gatherers.What makes the BBC dferent from the tax-dodging tech giants is that we love it. And you can’t grow up in this country and not have a deep and abiding affection for the BBC.I have endless happy memories of the BBC — from Match Of The Day to Top Of The Pops, from David Attenborough documentaries to The Likely Lads, from Fawlty Towers to the Hairy Cornflake.But the BBC has got far too big, far too bloated and far too wealthy.Lord Reith, the visionary behind it, wanted our state broadcaster to “inform, educate and entertain”. Lord Reith never dreamed of a state broadcaster that was all-powerful.The BBC gets far too much of your money and spends it far too easily. Why does the BBC need to be over every nook and cranny of the internet To the generation growing up on Netflix and YouTube with an entire universe on their smartphones, the BBC pocketing more than £ a year from everyone with a TV set is absurd.The BBC has got too big for its publicly-funded boots.That’s what we should be talking about — not the merits of free TV licences for granny and grandad!The Cairncross Review told how the BBC’s expansionist online empire has come very close to destroying the local newspaper industry.Are we really going to keep giving the BBC £billion every year so it can do the same to the national newspaper industry In the same week as the Cairncross Review came out, Bruce Sharma, , fought off thieves armed with a hammer and a machete with just his rolled-up copy of The Sun.Bruce was reading The Sun in Ram Stores in Long Eaton, Derbys, when the hooded pair burst in demanding money. “Instinct took over and I tried to whack them with the paper,” says Bruce.You can’t do that with a TV licence.GORDON Banks lit up my childhood.For my generation – a wide-eyed kid on that magical summer’s day in  – those World Cup winners will always feel like family.Gordon never got a knighthood.

However, the door should be left open for hershe shows heartfelt contrition and agrees to speak out on behalf of our nation against radicalisation.She has to be investigated for any criminal actions she has undertaken.

This was planned and conducted, carried out by one inidual who had control of the aeroplane via his job to have control of the plane.”He claimed that the pilot or co-pilot made the decision “to take it to a remote part of the ocean and make it disappear forever”.Passengers included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadnt been home in a year.But at .am on March , , Malaysia Airlines lost contact with MH close to Phuket island in the Strait of Malacca.Before that, Malaysian authorities believe the last words heard from the plane, from either the pilot or co-pilot, was Good night Malaysian three seven zero.Satellite pings from the aircraft suggest it continued flying for around seven hours when the fuel would have run out.Experts have calculated the most likely crash site around , miles west of Perth, Australia.But a huge search of the seabed failed to find any wreckage - and there are a number of alternative theories as to its fate.Vance spent  months doing research for his book MH Mystery Solved, but he was not part of the official investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.Vance’s theory has not been accepted by everyone.Former head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau Martin Dolan said on  Minutes: “The evidence is not yet sufficient to draw as firm a conclusion as you appear to have done.”He said there were two possible theories - that someone was in control of the plane or not - and that “there’s evidence that supports both of those theories”.Dolan added: The evidence is not yet sufficient to draw as firm a conclusion as you appear to have done.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000469847046.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"worlds worst tramp stamp tattoos","story":"A cringe-inducing gallery of the worlds worst tramp stamp tattoos will make you think twice about getting your lower-back inked."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000450450690.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eu lorries security checks no deal brexit avoid jams hmrc customs","story":"HMRC will this week declare a six month “standstill” in an admission that Border Force is nowhere near ready to cope with the extra administration.They have already waived the need for goods declarations at U.K. ports because of fears of massive jams.The Sun last week revealed the Home Office wanted hauliers to fill out -point safety and security forms in the event of No Deal.

If you look at our portfolio of goods, that could range from anywhere between % and %. That is a signicant new cost. We buyfishon a global basis, we makefishfingersin our factory in Germany and we bring those into the UK. We want to continue our investment story, we want to continue to grow our business and expand our capacity. But where we place those investments, with the current situation and the fiasco around Brexit, we cant decide where to do it until we get clarity.  Mr Hudson said that food manufacturers cannot control prices charged for their products by retailers in shops. But he added: If we are faced with substantial tarfs we will have to pass those tarfs on, and in turn our customers will need to decide whether or not they pass those on to consumer and shopper. Retailers are warning that there isnt the margin in the supply chain to absorb any more tarfs, he said. Writing in The Grocer, Mr Hudson dismissed claims from pro-Brexit politicians that warnings of the possible effects of EU withdrawal without an agreement amounted to scaremongering. The brutal fact is that,we leave the EU without a deal, food prices will increase virtually instantaneously as WTO tarfs would apply, he said. Scaremongering  Absolutely not. Whats really scary are the politicians who claim it is. For low-income families most vulnerable to food price increases a no-deal Brexit holds no positive outcome - a fact that politicians seem to be ignoring in their self-serving posturing, he said.

With weeks of nothing but a few slices of bread stretching out in front of the engaged couple and their unborn baby, Jaedyn put out a desperate plea to their new community. The response from kind-hearted locals was astonishing. As soon as his request for advice about food banks began to circulate online residents rallied together to donate a huge hamper of food. Where before they had the bare essentials, the couple quickly found themselves with a fridge full of bacon, fruit, soup, pasta, crisps, bread and dozens of tins, as well as eggs, milk, butter and cheese. The pair said the food haul will last them up to two months and will help four-weeks pregnant Lizzie to enjoy a healthy pregnancy.   Jaedyn said: I was amazed by the response we got, we didnt expect it at all. We had food from about three people, picked up by one of the ladies and dropped to us all on the first night that we had put the post up. And then from there to yesterday we have had four more people drop food to us. While doctors have recommended that the teen should not work at the moment, he is still looking for a job to make ends meet.   Jaedyn continued: The universal rate for being signed off is awful to live on so Im still looking for part time work, even when advised by the doctors not to be in work for the time being. I struggle quite badly with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I also have problems with my chest and breathing which makes physical tasks dficult, still waiting on x-ray and blood results to figure out why my breathing is so limited. I can barely make it up a set of stairs without gasping for air so any physically job wouldnt work. As well as the food the couple received plenty of advice as to which food banks to go to and how to get vouchers.   Jaedyns heartbreaking appeal on the Erdington community group on Sunday, February  read: Me and my misses are new to areaand we have been here for about four months now. We have moved into a house share of four people and unfortunately due to having a shared kitchen keep having our food vanish out the freezer. We have informed our support staff but they can only recommend calling policeWe have completely run out of food and we dont get any money between us until Thursday . We want to know where the nearest food bank is and how to get vouchers for it  My misses is pregnant and I dont want her to go without anything to eat for the next week, possibly month.

They found fumes from the meal were  times more polluting than a London roadside and  times over World Health Organisation safe outdoor limits. The shock levels were far higher than expected by scientists. Tests detected tiny particles, PM.s, that are inhaled and linked to heart disease, stroke and lung cancer, which contribute to , early deaths in Britain each year. Over a day, in a purpose-built home in Austin, Texas, the HOMEChem project produced and tested meals such as a full English breakfast, a vegetable stir fry for lunch, roast turkey for dinner and pies for dessert.  WHO safe limits of  micrograms of PM. per cubic metre were exceeded for eight-and-a-half hours out of the . Heating and burning during cooking produces particles, with some food producing more than others. A roast turkey dinner saw pollution levels hit  micrograms per cubic metre. The most PM.s appeared to be produced when Brussels sprouts were charred.  A similar cooking style for vegetables in stir fries was just as polluting as cooked meats. Burning fats in meat or adding them to frying and roast pans also gave high levels. Other sources of PM.s were oils left on electric hobs, heated saucepans and open flames on gas stoves. High levels generally lingered for about an hour after the cooker was used. Even putting two pieces of bread in a toaster produced  micrograms which stayed in the air for about  minutes afterwards. Lead researcher Prof Marina Vance, of the University of Colorado, said: “We were all a bit shocked when we saw our first measurement.  This is the most comprehensive ever assessment of chemistry in a home. These high-end instruments have never really been used to detect pollution levels indoors.” Levels detected dwarfed our Government’s Air Quality Index highest warning rating for outdoors. When there are - micrograms per cubic metre the public is warned to avoid strenuous exercise outdoors. The results were unveiled at the shyAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D.C.  Prof Vance said studies are linking long-term exposure to particles with brain ageing and increased stress levels. Leading British pollution expert Prof Ian Colbeck, of Essex University, said: “A roast is one of the worst ways of cooking as regards indoor air pollution. “However once you stop cooking, concentrations shygradshyshyuallyto background levels.” The AAAS also heard that children in homes with vinyl floors had far higher levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers — toxic, fire retardant compounds — in their blood.   Always cook using the extractor fan The shock findings of the HOMEChem study has sparked an urgent call to families to ventilate their kitchens. Prof Marina Vance said: “We’ve been telling ourselves ‘boil everything, don’t roast’ but roasts are just too delicious.”   The researchers advise while cooking to: open windows always use extractor fans and hobs at the back of the cooker keep your cooker and pans clean of oils heat on as low a temperature as possible and boiling food on electric hobs is best. Prof Vance said: “Use an exhaust hood, try to ventilate your home while you’re cooking. That’s really my prime piece of advice. “Before, I only used the oven hood ventilatorI was cooking something smelly. Now I put it on for everything.” "},{"url":null,"title":"flybmi woman left stranded after","story":"NewsFlybmi: Woman left stranded after airline collapse faces  hour journey homeHannah Price from Portishead is one of many British passengers who faced nightmare journeys home after the airlines sudden announcementShareCommentsByRobin Murray:,  FEB NewsHannah Price was in Brussels for work when the airline announced it had suspended all operations \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA British woman is facing a nightmare seven-hour journey home after being stranded in Belgium thanks to the collapse of airline Flybmi.

Liam Byrne is suspected to be lying low in the West Midlands amid a gang war in his homeland - where the authorities are trying to seize his cash and assets . The -year-old is allegedly a “trusted lieutenant” of the Kinahans, a feared cartel behind an international drugs empire estimated to be worth a billion euros, reports Birmingham Live. Originally from Dublin, the organised crime boss is said to have fled to the city in the midst of a gang war that has claimed  lives so far. Byrne was previously photographed carrying the coffin of his brother David, shot dead at a boxing event in Dublin in .   It is understood he is now living in a €,gated mansion in a Birmingham area popular with Premier League stars, entrepreneurs and millionaire professionals. Byrne is said to be affiliated to the wider mob, whose godfather is Christy The Dapper Don Kinahan, who now lives in Dubai. The High Court ruling against his operation, in favour of Irelands Criminal Assets Bureau , has also been said to be a reason why he has relocated to the West Midlands suburbs. An international operation involving Irish and UK law enforcement agencies is targeting the Kinahans and their associates.   They include jailed underworld boss James Mulvey, who was a key figure in rackets run by the Kinahans. Mulvey’s name has repeatedly cropped up despite the fact he is currently serving a -year jail stretch for running a pound million drugs trafficking empire. The -year-old mobster, originally from Solihull, lived a jet-setting lestyle, flitting between five-star hotels across the globe while managing a number of front operations for the Irish cartel. The CAB has been cleared by Irelands High Court to seize €.millionworth of assets belonging to Byrne and his gang. This includes two houses,  luxury cars and gold and diamond jewellery. One of the houses is his six-bedroom house in Dublin suburb of Crumlin, which has six bedrooms with en-suite jacuzzis, a cinema, swimming pool and garden hot tub.   In the original High Court document, which Birmingham Live has seen, Byrne is described as a “trusted lieutenant” of the Kinahans. The high-flyers operation is said to have originated in Dublin but to have interests in Spain, the Netherlands, South America and Dubai and to have links to criminal activity in Asia, the Middle East and South America. The court papers say: “He is the current head of the BOCGfraternity and is thereby heavily involved in drug trafficking and violent crime.”   The judgement, delivered by Ms Justice Stewart in July , also detailed the high-rolling lestyle of Byrne and his associates.

Byrne’s gang also moved between five-star hotels around Dublin and spent tens of thousands of pounds on flights. Byrne lost his brother, David, to the mob war between the Kinahan cartel and the Hutch gang. He was shot dead in the gun attack at Dublin’s Regency Hotel in , which is said to have sparked the feud. The venue was the setting for a boxing match but four masked gunman burst in and began shooting. Law enforcement agencies on the both sides of the Irish sea, including the National Crime Agency, are continuing to investigate the cartel.

Jenna Johnson died on January  however her family believe that the horric ordeal days earlier was the catalyst. The -year-olds body was found at her home in Thurso, Scotland after she failed to join her family for lunch at her mum’s house. Jenna was said to have been tormented by the thought of people in her home town finding out about the assault, report the Daily Record. After Jenna’s body was found, it was taken to Glasgow for a forensic examination. But tests were inconclusive because the sexual assault by two men happened days earlier, on the night of December  or early hours of December . Jenna told close friends and her little sister Ky the shyidentities of the two men who drove her to kill herself. Now her family wants justice.  And Ky and mum Carol Forrest have reached out to another Caithness family still demanding justice after more than five years. One of the men Jenna accused of rape is suspected locally to have murdered Stefan Sutherland, , in September , and to have got away with it. Police and the Crown Office continue to claim there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding Stefan’s death, despite a catalogue of evidence to the contrary. Stefan vanished after a night out in Lybster, Caithness, on September , . His body was found on the beach at nearby Occumster on September .  His blood was found on the walls of the suspect’s home and he had injuries consistent with being tortured when he was found. Carol said: “We know, and our whole community knows, that these two guys are evil and have carried out other sickening and violent crimes. “Stefan’s killer is the shyringleader. He thinks he is above the law and is a very dangerous man. He needs to be locked up or there will be more deaths.” Stefan’s dad Sandy said: “This guy should have been in jail for Stefan’s murder andhe had been, another family would not be suffering as we have.”  About a week before she died, Jenna had woken to find herself covered in bruises and scratches, with needle marks in one arm. As her head cleared, she recalled being seriously shysexually assaulted by one man and raped by another. The two told her they had filmed the attack and shythreatened to publish the video, taunting her that it would lead to the loss of her children. She showed Ky, , her arms after the assault.  Ky said: “One arm had needle marks and the other was covered in scrapes and bruises that looked like they had been made by fingers holding her down. “She didn’t tell me the full story but she told me who she had been with and I knew one of them was considered a murderer in our community. “She said she must have been drugged as she couldn’t remember clearly all that had happened. “I was actually angry at her for associating with them. “Over the Christmas period, she was subdued and quiet. But on Hogmanay, she brightened up, ordered a shymicrowave, things for the kids, shyornaments, candles and we talked about taking a winter trip together to Iceland and a summer holiday in New York.”  Carol added: “Jenna was not suicidal when she left her kids with me on Hogmanay. “Who orders things for their home and plans holidays when they intend to end their le  “In the morning, when I texted, ‘Happy New Year’ and she never replied, I got a bad feeling. She was coming to me to eat but she didn’t show and there was no sign of her on Facebook.” Worried, she called the police and two officers went with her and broke into Jenna’s flat, finding her dead inside. Later that day, Carol and Ky heard a full account of what Jenna had apparently gone through from friends. Ky said: “It seemed a few people in the community knew these two guys had drugged and raped her and filmed it, because they had actually been boasting about it. “They told Jenna they had filmed themselves doing sexual things to her and were shythreatening to send it to people, saying she’d lose her kids. “I don’t knowthey were blackmailing her or just enjoying having power over her but she was distraught. “Jenna was a loyal friend and totally devoted to her kids. “The thought of losing them would have been too much for her.” Her mum added: “I’m so angry with both these men. One is the ringleader and nothing about him surprises anyone who knows him but Jenna trusted the other one as a friend and he betrayed her.” The family has been told Jenna was drinking with the men when they turned on her, held her down and injected her with a sedative. Breaking down, Ky recounted how Jenna described the rape. She said: “We have told the police and the people she confided in have also made statements identying the men who did this, and they are both well known to the police. “We have no ideathey have been shyquestioned but we have been told that no video footage has been found and that they have been unable to access Jenna’s phone because it had a passcode. “Police told us it could cost pound to have an expert bypass the security and they would have to justy the cost to their bosses. “My sister was raped, threatened with public humiliation and I don’t know what  and she has killed herself as a result. “I don’t think you can put a price on doing everything possible to gather evidence to deliver justice.” Carol added: “The police appeared at first to want to push as hard as they could. “But we feel that it’s already been downgraded. There should be no argument about the phone being examined, no matter the cost. “Jenna was out with friends at a house party after leaving me on New Year’s Eve. They all say she was in good form. “She got a phone call and became agitated, but didn’t say who called or what it was about. “A text followed and her mood got even worse. When her friends moved on to another party, she wanted to go home. “She called me at about .am and told me to tell her kids she really loved them. I was half asleep and thinking she could tell them herself when she came for her dinner. “I didn’t realise there was anything major wrong and that it would be the last time we spoke. “The most important thing I can do now for my daughter is look after her children. “But I can also demand justice. She doesn’t have a voice any more so we have to speak for her. Too many serious and violent crimes have been swept under the carpet in this area in recent years. “Ky and I need to make sure this isn’t another one. “We want people to know how Jenna died and to know that eventhe men who raped and threatened her didn’t kill her with their own hands, they are responsible. “We won’t be fobbed off and we won’t stay quiet. “I had to bury my daughter two weeks after her th birthday. Our lives will never be the same. We are devastated. “Yet they remain free to walk around and choose their next victim.” Police said there were no shysuspicious circumstances surrounding Jenna’s death but refused to give further comment as there was an “ongoing investigation”.

It was speculated that at the time of the tragic Paris car crash that the late People’s Princess was expecting lover Dodi Fayad’s child. But Angela Gallop, whose career spans over  years, claims to have taken a sample of the -year-old’s stomach contents. And she explained that there were two key areas involved in the high profile investigation. She told The Sunday Times: The first was to seethe blood samples taken from Diana contained any of the pregnancy hormonehuman chorionic gonadotropin . The second was to look for any evidence that she might have been taking a contraceptive pill. The expert has written about her findings in her new book, When the dogs dont bark: A forensic scientists search for the truth. Professor David Cowan, former head of forensic science at Kings College in London led the forensic investigation to establishDiana was expecting her third child at the time of the crash.   At the time, Prof. Cowan said that blood transfusions desperately needed to save the Princess complicated pregnancy tests post-mortem, which meant that stomach contents were used to find the truth instead.Ms Gallop added: “So the best sample for testing was some blood that had been recovered from the carpet in the footwell of her seat in the Mercedes.” She confirmed that the results came out negative which means that it was very unlikely that Diana was pregnant at the time of the crash.  This reportedly matched up with information given by those close to Diana that there had been no other evidence to suggest she was pregnant.

It looks like they have got an exciting week planned as their mum and dad the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge appear to have taken the whole week off work. The couple have no engagements planned, so we hope theyre spending some quality time with their three children, reports the Express. Theres a chance the family will leave their Kensington Palace home and go away for a few days.   They normally go skiing around this time of year, and in  they released a set of adorable photos of a -month-old Princess Charlotte enjoying her first holiday. Kate and William are both keen skiers, as are the rest of the Royal Family, and go regularly. Butthey dont fancy a cold break the family might head to their country home Anmer Hall in Norfolk. Whatever they end up doing were sure George and Charlotte will spend lots of time playing with little brother Louis.  Last month Kate revealed that her youngest child is already a fast crawler, which suggests it wont be long until he talks those exciting first step.She also said that shes teaching George and Charlotte to cook , and they like to make meals together.Matthew Kleiner-Mann, chief executive of the Ivy Learning Trust, said: She was telling us how much her children love cooking and how they cook for her. They made cheesy pasta the other day. One stirs the flour, one puts the milk and butter in. And they make salads and stuff.

La Fauxmagerie, in Brixton, south London, sells artisan cheeses made from plant-based sources. It is the first totally vegan cheese store to open in the UK. But the dairy industry want to stop the shop branding plant-based products as cheese saying it is misleading to shoppers. The sisters who launched the business branded Dairy UKs claims both ridiculous and unnecessary. Rachel Stevens, , opened La Fauxmagerie with her -year-old sister, Charlotte.   The shop was hailed a huge success with vegans travelling far and wide to check out the new award-winning dairy free cheddar, camembert, mozzarella and halloumi on offer. The sisters, originally from a rural village in south Wales, ditched their day jobs to launch the business. But within days the independent business in the Brixton Village complex has ruffled feathers. The industrys trade association, Dairy UK, has accused the sisters of misleading customers by labelling vegan goods as cheese. But Rachel says the dairy giants claim discredits and underestimates the intelligence of their customers.   She said: Its clear in the name of our business that we are selling dairy free products - its a pun. Our tagline also clearly states we are a plant based cheese monger. We are not misleading and the claim that we are discredits the consumers and underestimates the intelligence of our customers. It all seems a little unnecessary, people are generally aware that plant based means non-dairy. Peanut butter doesnt include butter and when people ask for a soy latte at Costa, they ask for soya milk - not blended soya beans.  The former Marks and Spencer merchandise worker said: We expected some attention because we knew wed be the first in the country, but we didnt expect to ruffle feathers. Dairy UK sent a letter to the shop. We are going to take things as they come. I understand people might be sceptical because the food culture in the UK is very meat heavy. Rachel who moved to Balham, south London, four years ago only became a fully fledged vegan last month. But she and her lactose intolerant sister began plans to open their own dairy free business last autumn. Dairy UK has been contacted for comment.

Theres even the possibility of thunder for the Hebrides, while at the other end of country its a frosty start for the southeast of England. For many of us today will be a mild February day with temperatures hitting C - evenits a bit more dicey in the north. Fear not though, temperatures will be on the rise giving us the hottest day of the year so far later this week. And theres even an outside chance of the UK recording its warmest February day EVER with previous record seeing the mercury tip .C in .   As warmer air floods in from the south this record could be under threat. But back to today and southern and south-eastern England face a frosty start and it will be rather cloudy with some light rain, especially after noon. Elsewhere, there will be sunny spells but with showers for south-west England, Wales, Northern Ireland, north-west England and heavier rain for most of Scotland. Later on it will be a dry night for most, although northern England and southern Scotland may see a scattering of showers.  Coastal areas in northern and western Scotland may see some light showers in the early hours as well, but large parts of northern England will also see a mild night. But then temperatures will steadily climb, the the Met Office predicting a mild February - which could see the hottest day recorded in the month ever.Forecaster Simon Partridge told The Sun : “The February temperature record is .C - and theres a chance of reaching it, albeit a low chance.“The mid-teens are likely later in the week ahead, with potential for higher, although its a bit too early to say.

Britain could be set for its hottest February daya surge of warm air arrives next week, claim forecasters. It comes after an sudden break in the cold snap last week, with temperatures hitting C in parts of the country thanks to a Spanish plume.  The Met Office doesnt appear to be quite so optimistic, however, and is predicting snow could still be on the way by the end of the month.Writing on Twitter , Channel  weather forecaster Liam Dutton said: Signs that impressively warm air is likely to surge towards the UK and Ireland later next week.If it happens, theres a chance that the record for the UKs warmest February daycould be challenged.

Mystery still surrounds the final fate of the deadly flight which disappeared on route from Malaysia to China in  with  passengers and crew on board. Now writer Christine Negroni has suggested that the tragic jets demise may have been caused by a sudden depressurising of the cabin killing everybody on board. She believes the Boeing s captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah may have been on a break at the time with co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid at the controls. The sudden lack of oxygen would have killed all passengers and crew within  minutes, however, Hamid was insulated from its worst effects in the cockpit. But Negroni theorises, while not dead, the co-pilots oxygen starved brain led him to make a series of bizarre choices while attempting a rescue mission.   Eventually, he would have been unable to stop the final descent into the sea, which investigators believe is somewhere in the Indian Ocean. The author of The Crash Detectives: Investigating the Worlds Most Mysterious Air Disasters, told the Daily Star : The plane starts heading south. Whatever that time period is, thats the period of time I believe he went unconscious. The oxygen available for the passengers was about  minutes, so the passengers were all dead, theres no chance they were resuscitated, they were dead long before that plane hit the water. Negorni believes the cabin depressurised  minutes into the flight when it lost contact due to an electrical failure.  She added: Nothing that this pilot did, after the plane experienced its issues, made sense. To me when a pilot does something that doesnt make sense, it is a very strong clue that the pilot is not sensible. And what makes a pilot insensible is hypoxia, not just once but repeatedly.  Last week former air crash investigator Larry Vance suggested the crash was a murder-suicide. Vance said he was certain that either Captain Shah or Hamid stole the plane in what he termed a criminal event.

The ships were anchored well within British territory when it made the order to leave Spanish waters. The Gibraltar Chronicle obtained radio traffic between the boats, which allegedly told the boats they were “violating the condition of innocent passage”.The Royal Navy’s Gibraltar Squadron despatched two vessels, HMS Scimitar and a inflatable boat to shadow the ship.The Tornado then kept close to the Gibraltar coast line as it sailed out through the straight out of British controlled waters.   A spokesman for the Gibraltar Government told the Gibraltar Chronicle that officials were aware of the incident. “Her Majesty’s Government of Gibraltar is verying every aspect of the incident in order to ensure that appropriate action is taking as soon as possible,” the spokesman told the Chronicle. “Gibraltar VTS ensured that the vessels in question did not act in consequence of the illegal Spanish instructions.” “There is only nuisance value to these foolish games being played by those who don’t accept unimpeachable British sovereignty over the waters around Gibraltar as recognised by the whole world under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.” “It seems there are still some in the Spanish Navy who think they can flout international law.” “This probably accounts for the state of

decommissioning and steel tubulars specialist, John Lawrie Group, has agreed a multi-million pound deal to develop a new site at the Port of Dundee.The Aberdeen-headquartered company has reached an agreement with Forth Ports to establish a new metal recycling and decommissioning base at the Port.Both organisations will invest in the project, which will see an existing two-acre site at the city port redeveloped to create a new purpose-built concrete pad.The site will support the existing supply chain in Dundee in delivering oil and gas and decommissioning projects in the city.A combined investment of about £million is being made by both businesses in the development, which covers construction costs, the long-term lease of the site and the purchase of plant and equipment.John Lawrie Group will use the site to dismantle redundant offshore infrastructure brought ashore during oil and gas decommissioning projects and also for metal processing operations.Scheduled to be up and running in early , the facility will be operated by John Lawrie Group’s metals ision.  At launch, up to  new full-time jobs will be created, with the prospect of further posts being added as operations at the site develop.John Lawrie Group, which annually processes around , tonnes of metal, has been involved in the decommissioning sector for over  years.During that time it has handled piece small items from repair and modication projects, to piece large items brought ashore as part of entire  or field decommissioning programmes.John Lawrie Group, which operates metal recycling facilities in Aberdeen, Montrose, Evanton near Invergordon and Lerwick on Shetland, has previously carried out decommissioning work at the Port of Dundee.In , it dismantled a -tonne offshore module at the port, with the materials then being transported to the firm’s Aberdeen metal recycling facility where the redundant North Sea structure was fully processed and recycled.Dave Weston, John Lawrie Metals managing director, said: “This is a signicant investment for John Lawrie Group and comes  months after we acquired a metal recycling facility on Shetland.#It underlines our commitment to support the oil and gas decommissioning sector and forms part of our long-term strategy to develop John Lawrie Group’s operations across the country.#Operating facilities in close proximity to Scotland’s major ports also acknowledges the strategic importance we see them continuing to play as part of the country’s infrastructure.#Over the coming  months we will be working closely with all of the relevant authorities and licensing bodies as we finalise plans for this development in Dundee.#Our aim is to maximise the amount of materials that are reused and recycled, in order to minimise the volume of waste sent to landfill, helping to create a greener and more sustainable economy.”Led by Forth Ports and public-private partnership, Dundeecom, work is underway to position Dundee as an integrated hub for North Sea oil and gas decommissioning work.Boasting deep-water berths and a strategic east coast location, it is hoped Dundee will secure a sizeable portion of the £.billion that is forecast to be spent on decommissioning oil and gas infrastructure from the UK Continental Shelf over the next decade.David Webster, Forth Ports’ Senior Port Manager for Dundee and Leith, said: “This is a major milestone in Forth Ports’ strategy to develop a full service oil and gas decommissioning hub here at the Port of Dundee.“We are excited to be working with John Lawrie Group to develop this new decommissioning facility.  We have worked closely together on a number of projects and the company’s commitment to reuse and recycling and its strong track record is evident.#The opening of the facility in early  will be a very visible sign of the Port of Dundee’s ambition to support the North Sea oil and gas decommissioning sector.”Callum Falconer, CEO of Dundeecom, added: “John Lawrie Group is a long-established and highly regarded company that has an extensive track record of innovative thinking in oil and gas decommissioning.#It is great to welcome the company to Dundee on a permanent basis, where it will complement the existing supply chain.#John Lawrie Group’s decision to locate here is a real vote of confidence for the city as it seeks to continue to ersy its economy

Now it’s a question of getting settled in as quick as I can and just playing football,” he said.“I had obviously spoken to Derek McInnes and he said to speak to Jim McIntyre before making any decision.“The gaffer at Aberdeen left it up to me.“He told me he’d love to have me still up there butI wanted to go and get games he understood.“So I spoke to the gaffer here on the phone and I loved everything he had to say. I jumped at the chance to come down here.”And the -year-old sees the draws against Hamilton and Kilmarnock since he arrived as proof this is a squad that can pull away from the relegation zone between now and the end of the season.“The only frustrating thing for me so far is that we’ve not taken six points out of six from the two games I’ve been involved in but I think all the fans and us as a team can feel from those performances that we are building momentum.“In the Hamilton game it was a case of everyone trying to get used to each other. A lot of us had only come in right before the deadline and we only really had one training session together.“It was about trying to get to know everyone’s games, their personalities. I think we are all starting to gel now and you can see that on the pitch.“Not having a game last weekend because we’re out of the cup has given us a bit more time to work on that. That gives us a better picture going into the game against Livingston this weekend.”Today’s trip to the Tony Macaroni Arena to face Livingston is a meeting with a team who have taken the Premiership by storm this term but have been struggling for a win of late.Since thumping Hearts - in mid-December, Gary Holt’s team have not won in eight outings. Wright does not see that as a sign this could be an easy  minutes for Dundee.“We have to treat it that every game from now on is going to be a big game for us and this will be.“We know how Livi will be and they will work hard but all we can do is just prepare the way we want to and work on how we can play. Hopefully, that will be enough.“They haven’t won in a few games but it’s a testimony to Livi how many points they have. They started the season so well.”Today, of course, will see Dundee asked to play on Livi’s much-criticised plastic pitch.The debate over their use has surfaced again this week via the PFA canvassing their members for views on them. While Wright is very much in the camp that prefers grass surfaces, the articial surface is not something he’s going to gripe about.“All we can do is get on with it and we are not going to use the pitch as an excuse,” he added.“Playing in Scotland, you get used to them.“However, I think having everyone playing on grass is something that would benefit the top league.“You prepare for a team each week but, for these games, you also have to prepare for the pitch as well.“All we can do as players is give our opinion about them.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c63eaae15c952.51377498.jpg ","title":"dundee people next generation of female scientists see life inside working laboratory in dundee","story":"The next generation of female scientists visited a working laboratory as part of their Rainbow badge work.Young members of Girlguiding Dundee enjoyed a trip to Dundee University’s School of Le Sciences as part of efforts towards their “Medicine Maker” insignia.The girls worked with university experts to learn about bacteria, disease and the role of women scientists to mark Unesco’s International Day of Women and Girls in Science.The badge and activity pack have been developed by Dundee Guide leader and university undergraduate Jess Morris and a team of scientists led by medicinal chemist and Brownie leader Dr Fiona Bellany, of the university’s Wellcome Centre for Anti-Infectives Research .Jess said: “Fiona gave a talk to the girls about her work as a scientist, and they were surprised to find out about Dundee’s world-leading role in medicine making.“We decided we wanted to make sure that Girlguiding members could learn more about science in a fun way.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c66f3c140bd42.03003741.jpg ","title":"dundee residents physically sick after sea of human waste comes through pipes in their homes","story":"Resident on a city street have been physically sick after a “sea of human waste” came through the pipes in their homes.Carol Kilburn and neighbour Gail Taylor say they have had enough of the disgusting problem in their Dens Road properties.The sludge has seeped through the pipes over the last two weeks and homes have been left stinking as a result.The pair have contacted their landlords, the environmental health department and Scottish Water about the issue.The problem is not only in the flats, with the waste also running down the side of the building and into the garden.Carol said: “There have been issues with the main drain and pipe system at the back.

They have some very good players,” he said.“The first thing we have to do is try to win our battles but don’t forget they have scored some quality goals, some good team goals.“We have to try to make sure inidually we get the better of them and try to go and create opportunities to win the game.”Dundee go into the clash with controversy over plastic pitches like Livi’s rekindled by a PFA survey showing top-flight players are unied in opposition to them.The manager is also in that camp but hasn’t forgotten that defeat at the Tony Macaroni in his first game in charge was down to what happened in the air and not the surface.That day back in October his team conceded four goals from set pieces.“We didn’t deal with set plays and that killed us. It was an eye-opener that day in terms of what we had to work with,” he said.“There’s no doubt, though, the surface is an advantage. I was the manager of a team, Queen of the South, who had an articial surface andyou train on it every day it’s a definite help.“At the same time I’m not trying to detract from how well Livingston have done because they’ve done exceptionally well.”Dundee are still nursing a few niggling injuries from that Killie draw, but it’s hoped everyone who was on duty then will be available. Midfielder Ethan Robson is expected to recover in time from the groin injury that forced him to miss that game."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c66f3e663dbf4.07241684.jpg ","title":"respected dundee shop owner sorry for moment of stupidity in selling bottle of vodka","story":"A shop owner has been given a verbal warning after he sold alcohol outside trading hours – his only misdemeanour in  years of trading.Balbir Sharma – better known to locals as Bobby – sold a single bottle of vodka before am to a regular at his store on Haldane Avenue in Kirkton.The recently bereaved customer had “practically begged” him for the bottle of spirits, the city’s licensing board was told.Janet Hood, representing Mr Sharma, told councillors he was a “well-respected and hard-working man” who had acknowledged his error.She said: “He is really sorry he had this lapse and that he pretended having not made the sale.“He was afraid he was going to lose his business.“He knew this particular customer had recently lost his we and the man was very upset.

table will be hammer blow to their chances of overtaking second placed Rangers in the Premiership.The only positive, albeit minor, is that the Dons did not lose ground on Rangers who were held - by St Johnstone.A dismal day for the Reds was made even worse when on loan Watford defender Hoban was stretchered off with a knee injury late in the first half.Aberdeen fell behind to a penalty from Duckens Nazon before Lewis Ferguson headed an equalizer in the first half.However Buddies went ahead again through a strike from Kyle McAllister before a goal from prolic scorer Sam Cosgrove restored parity.Aberdeen made two changes to the side that defeated Championship Queen of the South - in the Scottish Cup fth round on Sunday.One was enforced with right-back Shaleum Logan ruled out with an ankle injury sustained in that cup victory.He was replaced by Mikey Devlin who made his first Aberdeen starts since a - defeat of Hibs on November .Devlin had been ruled out for three months with a foot tendon injury.Following his impressive sht as a half-time substitute in the cup tie Niall McGinn was handed a start with Stevie May dropping to the bench.Aberdeen should have netted the opener in the th minute when McGinn#s corner kick from the left found Lewis Ferguson racing in at the back post but he headed wide from eight yards out.Moments later McGinn raced onto a clever through ball from Mackay-Steven.Racing towards the by-line McGinn drilled a low, inviting cross along the face of goal but there were no takers.However it was relegation battling St Mirren who went ahead in the th minute when goal machine Sam Cosgrove, on  goals in the last  games, tugged down Paul McGinn.Referee Craig Thomson awarded a penalty that was converted by Duckens NAZON who fired the spot kick in off keeper Joe Lewis# right hand post.Aberdeen threatened in the th minute when Cosgrove played a superb through ball that split the defence to release Greg Stewart.Keeper Vaclav Hladky raced off his line

ahead moments later when Stewart squared a pass to McGinn but with the goal beckoning he scooped a shot over from  yards.Aberdeen suffered an injury set-back in the rd minute when on loan Watford defender Tommie Hoban was stretchered off with a knee injury.The defender went down when his studs looked to have caught in the surface going for the ball in front of the Main Stand.There was no contact with a St Mirren player as he appeared to twist awkwardly.Clearly in distress Hoban received treatment on the pitch before being stretchered off.It was the latest injury blow for the Watford defender who has only recently ed from five months out following shoulder surgery in August.Hoban also missed the whole of the previous season having suffered  a knee cruciate ligament injury that required surgery.St Mirren should have gone ahead soon after the break when Kyle McAllister#s cross from the right found Brad Lyons unmarked  yards out but his header flashed inches wide of the near post.Slack play when trying to move the ball out of defence was punished by St Mirren in the st minute when a loose pass was intercepted.Buddies raced up field and Lyons found McALLISTER who fired a magnicent,  unstoppable shot from just inside the penalty box into the far corner beyond Joe Lewis.The Reds drew level  in the th minute when COSGROVE met a cross from the left side with his  and

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"hscp welcomes community commitment ahead of crunch meeting","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

The bunds will help reduce the risk of debris reaching the A in the event of a landslide.This project allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of recycling the material being excavated from the Rest and Be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works.To keep roadworkers and motorists safe throughout the works, temporary traffic lights will be in place on the A at each location. This next phase of the works is expected to last approximately  weeks.Commenting on the works, Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland’s North West Representative said: #The installation of the next stages of the mitigation measures will provide more protection and resilience against any future landslips blocking this key route at both the Rest and Be Thankful and Glen Kinglas.#The temporary traffic lights are necessary to keep our teams as well as users of the route safe during the works, and the teams will do all they can to complete the project as quickly and safely as possible.#We encourage road users to plan their journeys in advance by checking the Traffic Scotland website for up to date travel information.#"},{"url":null,"title":"third sector interface launches new approach to service delivery","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Third Sector Interfaceis changing the way it supports all types of third sector organisations, including charities, social enterprises and community groups.Due to many people now finding information through digital means and the need for information and assistance to be accessible and consistent across the whole of Argyll and Bute, not just in the main towns, the organisation has launched a new website, argylltsi.org.The website, reflecting the TSI’s new corporate identity, contains a self-serve area allowing third sector organisations to find links to a whole iety of locally-based and more national resources that can support their development needs, as well as useful templates to use to run their organisations.The TSI will be growing and developing self-service over the coming months, with the site becoming a ‘one-stop shop’ for information that third sector organisations need to set up, govern and manage organisations – everything from how to start a social enterprise to raising funding from major donors.The TSI can also now be contacted through a central freephone number #   , available between the hours of am-pm, Monday-Friday.

Arthur Street Kitchen applied for permission to host live al fresco entertainment in the town centre. But councillors worried about noise want to carry out a site visit before making a decision. The venue’s manager Andy McPherson said: “We would like to have entertainment for customers in the garden this summer.” He said the music would not be too loud as the business is aware of residents living in the Arthur Street area of the town. Appearing before the South Ayrshire Council licensing board, he added: “We are hoping to reinvigorate Arthur Street. It is starting to come to le again.” Board chair Craig Mackay said: “Noise is the main issue here. “We would be looking for a noise report.” Mr McPherson said it would be background music featuring a musician playing acoustic guitar, for example. Ayr manager John Neil told the meeting no noise complaints were made last summer. The restaurant and pub also want to have a large screen to show sport and films. Arthur Street Kitchen is based in the former West of the Moon premises and beside the Vinyl night club. Councillor Mackay said: “The West of the Moon was a family space. What you are proposing is quite dferent.” Mr Neil said Arthur Street Kitchen still caters for children. He said: “We want to cater for as many dferent people as we can.” The decision will be made at a later meeting following a visit to the venue.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGardens and flowersAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback.

Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending.

His death revealed he had left his entire fortune in his will to his native town of Troon. His legacy would provide education awards and grants for the people of the town along with a new public school. As Marr’s train travelled north he decided to break his journey, to pay a visit to his sister in Girvan. He was close to his sister Helen and visited her often after her marriage to ColonelABGrant, owner of Killochan Castle estate at Girvan, who was also a senior partner in the firm of Grant Somerville  Co in London and was later ordained as Revd. Grant in the Church of Scotland. Marr had intended to spend part of his fortnight at Girvan but extended his stay to a month. Perhaps his change of heart was due to the widespread unrest taking place in Glasgow at that time. The January of  saw the so-called ‘Harbour Riots’, where racial confrontations were breaking out between black and white merchant seamen on the town’s quayside and spreading into the town. A four day General Strike was called for on January  and four days later George Square was crammed with tens of thousands of angry workmen. Crowds of unemployed men joined in the fracas for a  hour working week. As tempers flared the army was deployed, troops brought in tanks and armored vehicles to control the crowds. As tensions heightened it was not an environment travellers would want to find themselves caught up in. Eventually CK Marr left Girvan on Saturday February  for his onward journey north to his annual shooting and fishing break in Perthshire. As the train made its way towards the city he took ill with acute appendicitis. When taken off the train at the Central Station he was rushed to the Glasgow Nursing Home, but it was already too late as he tragically died in the operating theatre. There is little known of Charles Kerr Marr, despite having a successful career in the coal exporting business. Born on October , , at  Welbeck Crescent, Troon, he was the third son of Captain John Marr, master of the merchant ship ‘Reciprocity’, sailing between Troon and Canada. John Marr and his we Amelia had five children, sons William, John and Charles, along with two daughters, Helen and Amelia. Up to the age of ten, Charles attended the Parish School in Academy Street at Troon, going on to join his two brothers at Irvine Royal Academy to complete his education. On finishing his schooling, Marr was apprenticed at A  J Guthrie, Coal Agents at Troon Harbour. Unlike his brother John, who followed in his father’s footsteps to become a sea captain, Marr left home as soon as his apprenticeship ended, to work as a Commercial Clerk with Kitstons, Iron Merchants in Glasgow. Moving later to take up the position of cashier at Clyde Ironworks, only to leave a short time later to be manager of the firm of GrantSomerville  Co in London. The move may have been influenced by A B Grant, who was a senior partner in the company and married to his sister Helen. By the time he met his future we, some years later, there is no evidence as to when he moved back to Glasgow, or indeed any explanation found as to his change of occupation. Marr is recorded in the Scotland census of  as residing in Renfrew Street in Glasgow and again on his marriage certicate a year later, where he is also recorded as being employed as a Soft Goods Warehouseman.  Little is known as to why he left coal exporting to go into the Drapery business, or where he met and fell in love with his we Agnes Murray Kinghorn. However, Agnes’s father was a General Merchant, so it would seem likely he met her in his line of work. Charles and Agnes married on March ,  and set up home at Sutherland Terrace in Glasgow’s Hillhead. Unfortunately, after only  months of married le, Agnes tragically died of Phthisis Pulmonalis . She was just  years of age. Her death was a severe blow to Marr, leaving him brokenhearted and distraught, which had a profound effect on him. Shortly after he laid his we to rest, he had thought of going abroad to work, but instead accepted an appointment with Hull Blyth  Company of London. Within a year he was made a partner in the company when he developed the firm’s export trade. His work of establishing depots in numerous ports in the world gave him an opportunity to travel abroad, especially to China and Japan, where he found an interest in collecting oriental treasures. During his time with Hull Blyth the firm went on to become one of the largest shipping charterers in the UK. Charles Kerr Marr played a signicant part in the company’s worldwide success. Charles Marr moved to London after his we’s death, he never again owned a house. All his years in London, he alternated between two clubs, the Athenaeum and the Constitutional. The nearest he came to having a home was in his later years, when he rented two rooms in Camden House at Chislehurst in Kent, which was originally built for Napoleon the rd. Just being there helped him to relax and take up golf. He was reputed to be good company with a great sense of humour and well known to be very generous. Marr was a lover of the arts and music and in all that time he rarely spoke of his we, or of her death and he never remarried, even his closest friends assumed he was a bachelor. When he retired in  he spent a good part of each year fishing and shooting in Scotland. Two years before his untimely death, Charles Marr carefully drafted out his will in , leaving his entire fortune to the people of Troon and setting out the way it was to be carried out. Marr’s coal fortune legacy has given the town a magnicent architectural school building with playing fields the envy of the country. Marr College on its own is a fitting tribute to this man of extraordinary vision. By the time Marr College opened in  the school had attracted the most renowned academics to come and teach. It was the only grant aided school in Scotland that didn’t charge fees. A public school for every child of the town, had oak led class rooms, inlaid parquet flooring, Italian tiled corridorsa copper domed library, purple velvet drapes and teachers attired in flowing cloaks with mortar boards on their heads, this was seen by all to be a stunning,not magnicent, comprehensive school, deemed to be the best school in Scotland and envied by it. The CK Marr Educational Trust, the only one of its kind in Scotland, has provided awards or grants to hundreds of Troon students, of all ages each year. The addition of the MarrEducation Resource Centre in Troon Library, the only one then in Ayrshire, is a valuable educational resource for all who use it. Marr College and the CK Marr Educational Trust are a testimony to the wishes of Charles Kerr Marr and a fitting memorial to this great benefactor. He was buried beside his beloved we in CathcartCemetery in Glasgow. Over the past century the people of Troon owe a huge debt to custodians of Marr’s vision, the Marr Trustees, past and present. Over the decades the many Trustees, Boards of Governors and ious Clerks, Treasurers and Accountants, who have and still do today and for many decades to come, have successfully upheld the wishes of the town’s greatest ever benefactor and extraordinary visionary, Charles Kerr Marr.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnChurch of ScotlandUniversities and CollegesGlasgowEducationFishingArmed forcesLove and romanceSchoolsRenfrewTroonPerthshireGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema set return prestwick after","story":"NewsCinema set forto Prestwick after  year gapReturn to the golden age of screen in PrestwickShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB NewsFriends of Broadway - they want cinema open again \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCinema made a boldto Prestwick for the first time in more than  years.

He pointed to Celtic and Rangers matches as examples of tense clashes requiring robust licensing rules. Mr McCall said: “The standard practice is games start early and the reason for that is to limit the amount of alcohol supporters can have.” “We all know the outcome excess alcohol can have in certain circumstances.” Congragulating Talbot, he added: “We are all delighted to see the result. “The maintenance of the policy is important so we are not accused of favouritism.” Some venues wanted to offer breakfast to supporters. Auchinleck Talbot defeated Ayr by one goal to nil. Alcohol was not permitted inside the grounds and fans were told they would be refused entryintoxicated. However the licensing board made a slight concession for the Auchinleck Talbot versus Hearts game on Sunday, February .

John Senior has been an animal surgeon in the town for  years. He has also immersed himself in activities and volunteering for all sorts of causes. This week he was continuing his latest community activity as a hand bell ringer at Cumnock Old Church. John, , said: “All I want is the best for Cumnock and we are so fortunte to have so many things going on now. “I just want to make it better than it is.” The Keir McTurk Memorial Committee chose John after “much deliberation” from all the nominations. Chairman Colin Chisholm said: “John is someone who prefers to work behind the scenes rather than be at the forefront. “But his efforts for the community have proved invaluable.” John, originally from Edinburgh, has freshly retired from the Crossriggs veterinary practice in the town. When he arrived in  it was chiefly large livestock but treats mostly small animals. His we Heather, also a vet, remains involved in the management and their son Iain, the third member of the Senior family who is a vet, runs the practice. John is a very active member of the Cumnock Action Plan Committee, in which he has reformed the Cumnock Gardening Club assisted living in the arrangements for the Christmas festival and was actively involved in the poppy display marking the centenary of the end of the First World War. He is also an elder in the Trinity Church and a member of the fabric committee. John is an active member of Cumnock Business Association, a board member of the credit union and of Glaisnock Trust and Cumnock Tryst. Assistance he gives to both the Highland games committee and Camps is described as “invaluable.” But he said: “I don’t like standing on a pedestal. I prefer being in the background. “I somehow manage to find time for the things I want to do and I am not very good at sitting down doing nothing. “I enjoy being active and putting things back into a town that has supported me and given me a living for  years.” The presentation is likely to be at Dumfries House. The couple also have a son Alan, a chemical engineer in Cleethorpes, and daughter Kirsty, who works in Christian outreach in Hong Kong.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnCumnockAyrAyr NewsEdinburghChristmasChristmas gtsReligion"},{"url":null,"title":"volunteers bike tackle social isolation","story":"NewsVolunteers get on their bike to tackle social isolationCycling Without Age Prestwick is transforming lives of those with limited mobility in the area with their specially designed trishaw, a light three -wheeled vehcile with pedal used in Asian countries.ShareByLochlin Highet:,  FEB NewsVolunteers get on their bike to tackle social isolation \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCommunity volunteers are coming together to tackle social isolation and loneliness - and their project is wheely fun. Cycling Without Age Prestwick is transforming lives of those with limited mobility in the area with their specially designed trishaw, a light three -wheeled vehcile with pedal used in Asian countries . The three-wheeled rickshaw is a little more than a ‘sofa on wheels’ as it is engineered to accommodate two passengers in the front and driven by a pilot in the rear. Those with mobility restrictions - old and young- can take a trip to the seafront, enjoy the Prestwick promenade views and have a good old natter. Now the community project, who’s base has been kindly gted by St Ninian’s Episcopal Church, are eager to find more volunteer pilots and those keen to get out on the trishaw. Chris Cheales, of Cycling Without Age Prestwick, said: “We now have two trishaws and we are in the middle of a training programme to help - people become qualied before starting the operation in spring. We offer two-hour sessions to two passengers and there is the opportunity to go for a drink, stop to chat, pet a dog or just enjoy the views. “We are looking for people with limited mobility who may or may not also struggle with loneliness and isolation and who would benefit from the freedom of feeling ‘the wind in their hair’. “Time is a wonderful gt to give anyone. The group hope to expand as the project grows and take their trishaws on tour to visit care homes in the area. Chris added: “We envisage days allocated to ‘user groups’, to include care homes, those recommended by Dementia Friendly Prestwick, retirement housing and local churches. “Trishaws are not cheap so we need ongoing help to keep all this on the road. “We are looking forward to another sunny summer and sharing the project with others.” The Prestwick Peoples Project has also benefitted those involved, helping volunteers flourish and gain confidence. Zara Crumlish has been a Young Ambassador for Cycling Without Age for six months. Zara, , said: “I’ve always wanted to ride a bike when I was younger but I didn’t have the balance. “The trishaw has helped me get my confidence up. “It gets me out and about with the community. “And I’m excited because I really can’t wait to take elderly people out and show them the Prom.” •Would you like to be trained as a Trishaw Pilot  Or a willing volunteer to be a co-pilot to accompany trips  .

But wersquore not waiting. We have already made substantial changes so that every political ad on Facebook has to be authorised, state who is paying for it and then is stored in a searchable archive for seven years. No other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do.ldquoWe also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users.ldquoWhile we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago. We have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to , people and invested heavily in machine learning, articial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse.In the last year Facebook has come under intense pressure over some of its business practices, following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a series of data breaches and concerns over fake news and other content on the site.The committeersquos final report into disinformation and fake news also said electoral law was ldquonot fit for purpose and should be updated to reflect the move to ldquomicrotargeted online political campaigning.They called for a comprehensive review of the current rules and regulations surrounding political work during elections and referenda, and separately urged the Government to put pressure on social media companies to publicise instances of disinformation.Ministers were also asked to reveal how many investigations are being carried out into Russian interference in UK politics.The report is the latest attempt to crack down on social media networks, and follows accusations from digital minister Margot James that some firms show little regard for the security and safety of some of their more vulnerable users.The issue has come under increased focus following the case of schoolgirl Molly Russell, who took her le aged , after her family found material relating to depression and suicide when they looked at her Instagram account following her death.The Government is expected to publish a white paper later this year on proposals to reform laws to make the internet and social media safer.Damian Collins accused big tech companies of failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content Tory MP and committee chairman Damian Collins said: ldquoDemocracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised lsquodark advertsrsquo from unidentiable sources, delivered through the major social media s we use every day.

We need new independent regulation with a tough powers and sanctions regime to curb the worst excesses of surveillance capitalism and the forces trying to use technology to subvert our democracy.ldquoFew iniduals have shown contempt for our parliamentary democracy in the way Mark Zuckerberg has.

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"young footballers saddled up for funds","story":"Last Saturday, in the Co-op foyer, players took half hour shts, on two bikes, to raise more than £, towards funds to compete in the three-day Edinburgh International Youth Cup in August.A Campbeltown and District Juvenile Football Association spokesperson said: #A massive thank you to Campbeltown Co-op for allowing us to use their foyer to spin our way to a massive £,..#Thank you to each and everyone of you who supported us and also the words of encouragement, which meant a lot.#CDJFA, supported by quiz queen Helen Gilchrist, will hold a Big Quiz Night, at Stronvaar Bowling Club on Saturday March  with a £ top prize.The evening#s entertainment will include a quiz, raffles and television show games.The young spinners from left are: Josh MacDonald, , John McTaggart, , Jack MacNab,  and Daniel McEachran,._cfootballfunds_CDJFA"},{"url":null,"title":"andrew mccornick re elected president of nfu scotland","story":"Having already led the union for two years, Dumfriesshire farmer Mr McCornick will now hold office for a further two years by which time he will have served the maximum allowed under the constitution of a pair of two-year terms.After a keenly fought election, the vote for the two vice presidential posts saw Perthshire farmer Martin Kennedy re-elected to serve alongside Charlie Adam from Aberdeenshire, currently Livestock Committee chairman.The unsuccessful vice presidential candidate was Ian Sands from Perthshire, who is chair of the NFUS#s Combinable Crops committee.Under the terms of the constitution, Mr Kennedy, as a serving vice president, will be seeking re-election next year, having already served as vice president for two years.Mr Adam, being elected to the position of vice president for the first time, will initially serve for two years before the post reverts to an annual election.After the election Mr McCornick said: #There are dficult and challenging times ahead but Martin, Charlie and I have been given a clear mandate by members to represent them and we are honoured to carry their message forward.#Throughout the protracted and frustrating Brexit process, NFUS has been crystal clear about its priorities and through our ‘Steps to Change’ work we have mapped out our thoughts on a new agricultural policy for Scotland.#I believe we have a top table team, which, backed by the members, staff and secretaries, has the vision to deliver on that.#Those who choose to seek office and represent fellow members in any capacity undertake a huge commitment and although missing out, I congratulate Ian for the part he played in a hard-fought campaign and the outstanding work he does in representing his sector.#NFUS president Andrew McCornick.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

There is limited space for such activities within the building which can be accommodated where, enabling access to a wider range of activities and resources.

These staff are not involved with the day-to-day running of the building or the activities which take place there, as it is managed by FES under a separate contract. This arrangement continues.ldquoWe are always keen to maximise the use of community buildings and are exploring whether it might be possible to establish additional provision within the building in the future.

But consent is something that has more weight, more value, more meaning.\"To consent to something demonstrates an understanding, that its something youre thought about. To me, the two are not interchangeable.\"Britton said that existing case law also highlights that the next of kin have a human right to be consulted under an opt-out system, pointing to the case of a bereaved we from Latvia who took her case to the European Court of Human Rightsafter medics failed to get her permission to remove tissue from her husband after he had died in a car crash in .Dzintra Elberte only discovered that tissue had been taken from her husbands legs before his funeral when Latvian police launched a criminal inquiry two years later into the illegal removal of organs and tissue between  and .It turned out that forensic experts had removed and dispatched some of his body tissue to a pharmaceutical company in Germany to be modied into bio implants.The prosecution was eventually dropped in  when Latvian judges ruled that while the countrys presumed consent system gave next of kin a right to object, the law \"did not impose such an obligation\". However, Mrs Elberte subsequently took her case to the ECHR where she was awarded euro,damages after judges ruled unanimously that her human rights had been violated.They also criticised \"inadequate legal safeguards\", which meant that while a deceaseds next of kin were allowed to object to organ donation the law \"did not clearly define the corresponding obligation of experts to obtain consent\".\"There is this aspect of a human right to be consulted,\" said Britton. \"But the opt-out legislation thats been passed in Wales and proposed for Scotland hasnt really gone down the path of defining that. Now perhaps they feel that because that dialogue and that communication is going happen at the time with the families, but the reality is that very often time is of the essence.\"The law would look at a reasonable attempt - whatever that means in law - to get in touch with whoever is available.\"The vexed question of whether opt-out will actually increase the number of organs becoming available for transplant is something we \"cannot answer\", said Britton. Partly it is because very few people - around one per cent - die in circumstances, such as road accidents, where organs would be viable.In Wales, where an opt-out system came into effect in , there was little change in the number of organ donors: figures show there were  deceased donors in the  months before the law changed, and  in  months after.Britton stressed that a change of legislation alone on its own will not be enough - something she acknowledges that MSPs have taken on board.In Spain, where opt-out was introduced in , there was little discernible effect until a decade later when funds were poured into training more doctors and nurses for intensive care. The whole ethos of the country is also geared to organ donation as a norm, said Britton. But, she stressed, this is something that Scotland - with its comparatively high donor registration rates at present - is well-placed to mirror in future.She said: \"Scotland sadly doesnt have the luxury of the number of intensive care units that Spain has. The other dference is that where we talk about opt-in, opt-out and presumed consent, Spain doesnt tend to emphasise so much on the opt-out element.\"They emphasise much more that there is a general cultural understanding that everybody opts in, but they still have discussion with the family as well.\"Scotland actually has a very good record in terms of the size of the country and population we have. There is good uptake of people currently opting in.\"So evenit doesnt make a dference in the short term, looking at the experience of other jurisdictions in the longer term, it does.\""},{"url":null,"title":"monica-lennon-msp-snp-government-must-ensure-school-meals-are-nitrite-free","story":"Nitrites add colour to processed meats and prolong their shelf le but scientists are clear on the dangers these foods pose to the public.Four years ago, the World Health Organisation published evidence that linked processed meats ndash such as bacon and ham ndash to colorectal cancer, identying nitrites and nitrosamines as the likely cause.And last year, a ground-breaking University of Glasgow research study of more than , women found that reducing processed meat consumption could cut a womanrsquos risk of developing breast cancer.

The Scottish Tories make valid points about the Governmentrsquos record on transparency, but their arguments is weakened by the fact they voted against the Freedom of Information Scotland Act in .ldquoIn our view, open government need not necessarily mean a bureaucratic system that will cost the taxpayer pound. million a year, declared the then Tory MSP Lord James Douglas-Hamilton. Such opposition has not aged well.In coalition with the Liberal Democrats, Labour introduced the FOISA, but Ministers quickly became exasperated. One dismissed the legislation to me as the ldquonosey bastards charter. I am also old enough to remember Labourrsquos Margaret Curran, at that point the Parliament Minister, toying with a new charging regime in order to deter journalists and lawyers.However, the SNP Government has proven to be an Olympian of anti-FOI activity. And Alex Salmond, as First Minister, was the Steve Redgrave of secrecy.After he became FM, the Scottish Government contended that FOI provided a right to information, not documents. Applicants could not simply ask for emails, reports or minutes, but they would have to say precisely what they wanted in these documents. It was an impossible ask that thrust a stake through the heart of the legislation.In , Ministers told the Scottish Information Commissioner - who adjudicates on disputes - that  of  appeals to the SIC were invalid on the grounds that ldquodocuments were being sought. Some of the cases included requests for correspondence between Salmond and SNP donor Brian Souter, as well as between him and tycoon Sir Angus Grossart, and pop star Sandi Thom.Pushing ahead with this cynical approach, which followed a Court of Session ruling, would have destroyed FOI and Salmond eventually relented.His Government also tried to undermine the authority of the Commissioner. During an appeal process, the SIC can have full access to the information in a dispute, but Salmondrsquos administration queried this power in court. Again, he backed down after a backlash.The Sturgeon Governmentrsquos hostility to FOI is less overt, but no less insidious. Rather than challenging the law through the courts, other ways have been found to dodge its provisions and block the release of embarrassing disclosures.The Act provides a right to ldquorecorded information. If it is not recorded, it cannot be released. And so dozens of vital Government meetings, which have led to decisions that bear a cost to the public purse, have never been minuted.Backers of billionaire Jim McCollrsquos private college project met Government officials in  about securing funds for the project. No minute was taken. The same was true when the then Justice Secretary Michael Matheson held meetings to discuss the reinstatement of a chief constable suspended for alleged bullying. A bad habit appears to have turned into Government policy.The Salmond sexual misconduct investigation Salmond symbolises the SNPrsquos approach to FOI. The First Minister met her predecessor at her house to discuss the Governmentrsquos handling of its internal probe into Salmond. Her publicly-funded chief of staff was also present. But, according to Sturgeon, this was party business and no minutes exist.It is also not possible, claims the Government, to say whether Salmond emailed Sturgeonrsquos office last year about the probe. This is because, apparently, officials ldquodo not keep a log of every email received on a topic.By contrast, the SNP issues regular demands for full transparency from the Tory Government on Brexit and host of other reserved matters.

He denies any criminality.The Herald on Sunday last month asked the Government for the number of emails that the offices of the First Minister and the Permanent Secretary received from Salmond, or his representatives, between January  last year and August .The content of any emails was not requested, just the number of communications, but the response stated: ldquoThe Scottish Government does not have the information you have asked for because while we retain key documents as appropriate, we do not keep a log of every email received on a topic.One insider said the answer was ldquostrange as a search of a relatively small number of staff inboxes would be ldquostraightforward.However, the response has raised further questions about the Governmentrsquos commitment to freedom of information.Sturgeon met Salmond three times last year to discuss the misconduct probe, but no minutes were taken of the meetings.It was also reported yesterday that Sturgeonrsquos officials blocked the release of a letter sent by the First Minister to Evans about her contact with Salmond.On January , the First Minister told MSPs: ldquoI was concerned that [a legal] challenge could be imminent, so I told the permanent secretary then that I knew about the investigation and I told her about the previous meeting, including the reference to a potential legal challenge.ldquoI told her that I supported her decision to investigate and that I would not seek to intervene in the investigation in any way.However, in response to an FoI request by the i newspaper, the Scottish Government said disclosure of the full letter ldquocould prejudice a case currently in court in Scotland.Sturgeonrsquos chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, was also present at the meeting Sturgeon had with Salmond at her home, but her attendance was not in her official Government diary."},{"url":null,"title":"two-thirds-of-organic-land-in-scotland-has-disappeared","story":"And yet, almost unnoticed, Scotland has lost its early lead. Two-thirds of what was once organic land has reverted to conventional farming just as other nations soar ahead. Scots, hit by first the financial crash and then Brexit uncertainty, consume far less chemical-free food than most other western Europeans.Even after years of gradual increase in demand, the total market for organic food and drink in Scotland last year was less than a twentieth of that of Denmark, a country of roughly the same size.In  the Scottish Government moved to stall the decline with a new plan of subsidies and support. The number of producers is at a six-year-high and the amount of land farmed originally has stabilised.But with reforming agriculture now a global climate change priority, can Scotland, and its multi-billion-pound food and drink industry, now catch back up with faster-moving rivals The ShoppersWilliam Swanson knows his food. Or rather, he knows what can be in his food. And that worries him.The retired analytical chemist is doing his messages, squinting at the ingredients and provenance of some chilled tofu.After a career checking, among other things, how much pesticide or herbicide is in what we eat, Mr Swanson takes care of himself.So he, we Janette and daughter Louise - all vegetarians - are browsing in Locavore, a store on Glasgowrsquos Southside which sells mostly organic or local produce. His concern  Chemicals. His wersquos  Plastics.ldquoI am really worried about plastics and all the extra packaging you have these days,rsquo Mrs Swanson. ldquoHere you bring your own bottle and fill it with shampoo.rsquo Behind her, customers are doing the same with milk from a tap on big stainless steel fridge.Reuben Chesters likes what she is saying. He runs Locavore. He waves towards his green-grocery section where there is barely any plastic, bar bags of salad. Locavore packages some of its greens - often from its own small-holding in East Renfrewshire - in plastics. But they are biodegradable, made from thistles. Most of his shoppers pick up their loose veg and pop in in their own bags - or paper ones.But concerns in to plastics and pesticides - the traditional drivers of organic shoppers - now fit in to a bigger picture: global warming.The RetailerLater, perched on a old-style dustbin full of loose rice, Mr Chesters, , explains that people come in to his store for a whole bunch of reasons - not least the coffees served in s beige cups and saucers at tables next to big picture windows,Some are health conscious, he says. Some are environmentally conscious. Some both.But why did he get involved  ldquoClimate change is my initial driver, he says. ldquoAlong the way, everything  has got tied in with it, overall sustainability, for employees and suppliers and packaging and the wider natural environment,ldquoBut climate change is a huge part of it. Food is very often overlooked as a cause of global warming. Food is a third of all greenhouse gases, before we start tying in transport and energy production related to it.That makes Locavore, its aisleslightly dusted in good clean earth from loose boxes of organic root veg and its walls painted autumnal yellow, the front line in the war against global warming. It and an entire global movement to make food and farming more sustainable.Agriculture accounts for around a third of carbon emissions, compared with perhaps a th for aviation. Why  Party because conventional farming uses vast quantities of fertilisers made using fossil fuels. The take-away:we want to save the planet, we are going to need to change the way we farm. What kind of farming avoids chemical fertilisers  Organic.Tackling climate change, cutting greenhouse gas emissions, is a global and Scottish policy priority. So what are national and local authorities doing to support change in farming The IssueScience - and the the United Nations - is on Mr Chesters side. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation backs low-impact farming, using a combination of old customs and new technology. \"The lower-input of fossil fuel dependant resources and the use of renewable energy all present opportunities for organic agriculture to lead the way in reducing energy consumption and mitigating the negative affects of energy emissions,\" it says.The Scottish Government agrees. It has a plan to reboot Scottish organic farming. Its objective is far from hidden: \"An increase in the proportion of land managed organically,\" it declares, \"will ultimately help to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.\"That, at least, is the aspiration. The reality is rather dferent. Mr Chesters is quickly upscaling Locavore, which has its own smallholdings producing salads and even livestock and a chain of loyal suppliers.But it is far from always easy to source Scottish organics, even for some of the nations iconic produce. Fancy home-grown organic strawberries  Rapeseed oil  Ayrshire tatties  They do not exist. A single orchard is trying to grow organic apples.Organic advocates are quick to stress the commercial market for produce has been growing steadily for seven years. The Soil Association, which certies producers as organic, measured the entire UK market at pound. billion in , its highest ever figure. That amounted to . per cent of all Britains food and drink. A lot  Yes, but not by international standards.There is no Scottish breakdown of that number but separate figures suggest the market is disproportionately small north of the border.The Scottish Government cites data from consumer intelligence firm Kantar World suggesting sales of organic groceries were up some . per cent in the year to March , to roughly pound million.That compares with a figure in Denmark, which is roughly the same size as Scotland, of more than pound. billion in . More than  per cent of Danish groceries are organic. That is the highest figure in the world. In Sweden the figure is nine per cent in Germany more than five in France more than four.And yet it used to be Scotland that was ahead of the game. Back in  some . per cent of farmland was certied organic. The figure is now hovering at . per cent, having risen in , for the first time in a decade, to , hectares. Across the UK the organic acreage fell from . per cent to . of all farmland.Meanwhile, in the rest of the European Union, the trend is the exact office. The share of EU land farmed organically has jumped from . per cent in  to . per cent in .There is a a slight health warning on the scale of Scotlands \"crash\" in organic acreage. Some of the decline comes from hill farms which have deserted certication schemes, finding the extra expense of going organic was not delivering premium prices for their lamb. These businesses may have owned a lot of rough grazing land but they may not have produced much meat.The Big EstateOne of the big hill farming businesses to drop out of Scotlands organic scheme was Atholl Estates, effectively three or four huge chunks of Highland Perthshire.It is , hectares in total. The equivalent of nearly half Scotlands current total organic land area. It had been an early adopter of organics. So quitting was not taken lightly.Its general manager, Andrew Bruce Wootton, blamed demand. Just not enough Scots were ready to pay more.\"Sadly, I think it was the loss of premium prices in the market probably caused of downsizing in the organic acreage,\" he said. \"Pre-financial crash there was a very healthy premium, particularly in the aftermath of mad cow disease and other food scares.\"People were concerned about how their food was produced and where it came from. Economic pressures have put pay to that discretion.\"Mr Bruce Wootton cited other problems with being organic. His estates centre-piece, Blair Castle, missed weedkiller on its lawns and gardens. Its appearance, he said, started to \"worsen\".But Mr Bruce Wootton raised another issue. There are strict rules on what counts as organic. You can lose certication - and subsidies, such as they are,you flout them. But that does not mean that conventional farmers or producers cannot use some organic methods.\"We maintain a lot of the standards and approaches the organic scheme taught us,\" he said. \"So there is a legacy improvement to the environment but the scheme was not making commercial sense to us.\"The agronomistPeter Lindsay, breaking off from ploughing a field at his farm, Wemyss, near Forfar, echoes Mr Bruce Woottons warnings on price.But he admits that is far from always commercially easy, not least for farmers selling a premium product, such as grass-fed Scotch Beef. Consumers do not, he reckons, want to pay for two premiums, one for for a quality provenance and another for organic.Mr Lindsay works for SAC Consulting, a spin-off firm of Scotland Rural College, SRUC. One of his jobs is to help farmers go organic. So he knows the score.ldquoThe credit crunch made things dficult. People did not have spare cash. Demand dropped. But now I think we are seeing an increase again.Mr Lindsay things the demand is coming first for cheaper produce, vegetables rather than prime beef. But the thing about organic farming is that it is particularly well suited to a traditional mixed farm producing a whole range of produce, from potatoes to cereals to meat.That is because organic farmers rotate their fields, from livestock to dferent plants. ldquoWith more organics, ldquoMr Lindsay explains. ldquoYou wonrsquot see fields of monoculture. Yoursquoll see more weeds. And yoursquoll see more wildle as beetles and other bugs come back - and the birds and animals that feed on them. And there are more native breeds, animals more suited to our grass.But with just two per cent of Scotland farmed this way, Mr Lindsay acknowledges it will be a while before Scotlandrsquos agricultural landscape reverts back to is old image.ldquoOrganic is still niche. I cannot see the tide turning completely. There is a long way to go before we notice an impact. In some ways, organics is easier for Scottish farmers. Because itrsquos ato traditional methods. It is all very much grass-based. More organic farming might just mean Scotland starts to look more like itself.The farmerThat is how is how Robert Shanks feels. He has a dairy farm, Queenscairn, near Kelso, and has recently gone back to organic milk after a few years of conventional. His voice brightens up when he talks about his new-ish herd: Frisians. ldquoI love the black and whites,rsquo he says. ldquoMy grandfather started with them in . They eat our grass and here in the Borders we have as good grass as anywhere.When he was making non-organic milk he had Holsteins, an American breed that has bigger yields than Frisians, but which rely more on extra food than the more traditional British animal.ldquoIt is like a turkey that cannot fly, he said of the foreign cow. ldquoAll they do is have feed shoved down their necks. That feed, of course, is not organic. The cost of organic cereals or soy for as animal feed is prohibitively high. Hence a switch to native breeds.But that comes at a cost. Mr Shanksrsquos Frisians produce - per cent less milk than his old Holsteins. That is  litres less of the white stuff per cow per year.Mr Shanks, who has  cows, has no problem with friends and neighbours, some of whom have more than  animals, sticking with conventional farming. Like Mr Bruce Wootton at Atholl Estates he stresses there are plenty of good clean Scottish producers who are not organic but still pretty environmentally responsible.ldquoSome people pooh-pooh organic farming, he explains. ldquoBut I say it is like farming  years ago but with modern equipment. I think it is the modern way. I do think there is an overuse of chemicals.ldquoI think the government has abdicated responsibility on food policy to the supermarkets. That is why we have obesity and poor health. And it is why farmers are not making much money - I am living proof of that. Yet we are producing a surplus of food but wersquore not rich. That doesnrsquot make any sense.Mr Shanks loves clover, the way farmers like his grandfather, also Robert, kept their grazing lush and green. This little plant helps fix nitrogen in his grass, boosting growth, rather than the chemical fertilisers most farmers use. It is not quite as effective. But it works. That gets Mr Shanksrsquo Frisians their dinner. And, he swears, it makes their milk tastier.ldquoEverybody thinks their product is good,\" he says with pride. \"But I think my milk tastes better, because the grass-fed cows produce more butterfat.\"The DairyRobert Graham buys Mr Shanks milk, all of it. Hes managing director of Scotlands biggest independent dairy, Grahams. Organic business is doing well for him, with year-on-year growth, he says, \"in the teens\".A few years ago over breakfastMr Graham dreamt up a new product, or rather than old one: organic non-homogenised milk in a bottle. Or milk, as it used to be called, with cream on the top. \"It has a dferent taste profile,\" he says. \"And it has been phenomenal and is selling in Waitrose and Sainsburys across the UK.\"A litre of Mr Grahams whole organic milk sells in Waitrose for pound., in a recyclable PET bottle. The same quantity in Locavore is roughly the same, pound., though you have to bring your own refillable container.Those prices, in most supermarkets, would buy you more a standard four-pint, .L plastic bottle of conventional semi-skim.The GovernmentPolicy-makers know high prices for organics will depress the market, not least with Brexit uncertainty on the horizon.So the state - with its climate change agenda - has to pick up some of the slack. That means subsidies - and public procurement, for school, military or hospital dinners - to push demand to a scale where prices can come down off their heights.Take rich Denmark again. Its government last year announced a package of subsidies of nearly poundm for its organic sector in -. Ministers in Copenhagen are snfing export opportunities too. \"We are seeing places where the middle class is growing and demand becoming larger. We see it particularly in China, its food and environment minister, Esben Lunde Larsen, told Ritzau, a news agency.And Scotland  Conventional food and drink experts are booming. So is the domestic market. So what is the Government here doing to support the sht to organics  It is currently offering subsidies through something called its called Agri-Environment Climate Scheme. A spokeswoman valued such support at poundm. That is not poundm this year. That is the figure for total subsidies, including a predecessor fund, ever, to date. True, there is also free advice on hand for farmers.Back in , just as figures underlined the scale of decline, the Government announced a plan to increase organics. It ends next year but has no specic targets. How can we measure its success  A spokeswoman said: \"We do not support the idea of a land target as conversion to organic is a business decision for each farmer.\"The planrsquos vision is to have a vibrant, successful, sustainable, world-renowned Scottish organic food and farming sector by . We are currently assessing progress with delivery of the plan.\"There is some good news, she said, the number of organically certied producers was up in , to a six-year-high.The Government, meanwhile, does not buy much organic good. It is investing in Food for Le, a scheme that helps schools purchase local or organic food for lunches Only two Scottish councils, north and east Ayrshire, have managed to get full gold awards under the project. That means  per cent of what goes in their dinners is organic.Scaling up this scheme, whisper organic market watchers, could be revolutionary. Producers selling to the state, even at low margins, could scale up and cut costs. The dference, they argue, between selling by the cardboard box, and by the palet, is huge.The LobbyChampions of organic farming sound upbeat. David Michie, of Soil Association Scotland, concedes the industry took a hit after the financial crisis, from -. Demand, is recovering, but by the very nature of farming, supply is taking time to catch. \"Perhaps inevitably, farmers did not see organic as a viable option after ,\" he said. \"As sales in the market picked up again, there was a lag between this sales growth and the amount of land farmed organically because the conversion period to organic from conventional farming is two years.\"Mr Michie said more and more businesses are applying for the conversion subsidies from the government, \"in part because support payments are guaranteed for the next five years... but also because organic sales have been growing.\"The Soil Association - which has been supporting organic farming for decades before it became trendy in the s and early s - backed the Scottish Government approach.Mr Michie said: \"In the past wersquove found that targets have been counterproductive because increasing production is not always matched by increasing consumption.\"Having organic farming as a National Priority, where farmers are helped to get access to conversion and maintenance support, is more appropriate.\"The ShoppersBack at Locavore in Govanhill, the Swansons have thousands of whole or organic products to choose from, many Scottish. But are they too expensive  Is organics a middle-class fad  Mr Swanson nods.\"If you look at some of the product, you would have to say thatit was not organic or locally sourced, it would be cheaper,\" he says. \"I think there is an argument to say it is for people with money.But there is a but, he reckons. Root vegetables or salads, even organic ones, are not expensive compared to ready meals. \"If you were prepared to make your meals from scratch, your food would be cheaper and tastier,\" he said.Mr Chesters listens. His food, he says, is price competitive with the supermarkets organic range. Locavore is a community interest company, so any profits are for public good. But he admits getting poor people to buy is \"tricky\"\"Our custom is overwhelmingly local, walking distance,\" he says.\"We dont have the basement prices or a Lidl or where-ever because we are doing this properly and doing things properly is expensive. We are conscious there are barriers.\" \"We have a good food fund, which is effectively a food bank we operate.

That responsibility should be the hallmark of a good education system.A policy of inclusive education requires that schools are supported to suit the abilities of all children. When pressures mount ndash whether that is due to budget cuts, how resources are deployed or when what counts as the hallmark of a good education system changes ndash there will be those who will say inclusive education is a failed policy.Yet there is no guarantee that another type of school will be better.

However, we do have the  FGM Act. Recently, we learned of the first conviction for FGM in the UK since the Actrsquos introduction  years ago. Why such an effectively zero conviction rate after  years  Is it because pound million was spent by the UK Government on tackling FGM not here in the UK but in Africa, as announced by the International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, in November The UK Governmentrsquos track record for both convictions and funding over the past  years speaks for itself and shows us the  FGM Act of Parliament is as useless as one that goes by the name Do Not Step on the Grass.Dr Graham SeedLivingstonDouble standards on permissionWhy does the Scottish Government need permission from Westminster to hold a referendum to leave the Union of the UK but Westminster did not need permission from anyone to leave the European Union Scotland voted to remain but not only are we outnumbered by English voters we hardly ever appear on discussion programmes about Brexit.Real control over Scotland comes from Westminster, not Brussels.Bill KerrCumbernauldJust a theory  Donrsquot be so sureIn his article ldquo +   , it is sad indeed to see Neil Mackay stigmatise dissenters and parrot the Establishmentrsquos denigration of iniduals prepared to challenge official mainstream narratives . Mr Mackay implies those who do not believe government explanations for certain major events such as  , the moon landings or the assassination of President Kennedy are innumerate, paranoid, deranged weirdos.In doing so he disparages over , highly intelligent, educated and respected architects, physicists, civil engineers, explosives and demolition experts from across the world who have clearly stated that it is impossible for the twin towers to have collapsed as they did purely from fires on the upper floors caused by aircraft crashing into them.Rather than taking cheap shots at these experts, perhaps Mr Mackay might care to explain how they are all mistaken. Perhaps he could also explain how World Trade Centre  ndash which had not been struck by an aircraft ndash likewise suddenly collapsed. By applying the basic laws of physics to the destruction of the buildings, experts have proven that official explanations that fire caused their collapse are fraudulent.Regarding events in Dallas in , Mr Mackay likewise denigrates the thousands of scientists, ballistic experts, legal experts, film analysts and others who have debunked the official Warren Commission finding that a lone gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald, killed President Kennedy. Anyone who now believes that guff about Oswald must be seriously intellectually challenged.On the moon landings, Mr Mackay likewise dismisses as cranks the many top physicists and radiation specialists across the world who state categorically that it is impossible for living beings to survive passage through the lethal Van Allen radiation belts that exist between planet Earth and the moon. Official accounts that the astronauts were protected internally with massively heavy lead shields are beyond a joke.No astronauts have died after passing through the radiation for the straightforward reason that no manned spacecraft have ever traversed that expanse. Any Herald on Sunday reader who wishes to understand how the ldquomoon landings were actually faked in Hollywood studios would do well to purchase a copy of the truly astonishing documentary film American Moon by a real investigative journalist, Massimo Mazzucco.Arguably the biggest ldquoconspiracy theory of all relates that the mainstream press and its reporting is controlled by the ruling oligarchs.

Short of a calamitous sht in the military dynamic on the ground whereby the Kurds find themselves preoccupied with, say, advancing Turkish forces and are hard pressed to concentrate on securing the IS prisoners, they will remain incarcerated.Quite simply, itrsquos in no onersquos interests ndash least of all Washingtonrsquos ndash to have hundreds of jihadi fighters back in circulation.That said, therersquos no doubt the Kurds are currently struggling to cope with the responsibility of holding perhaps , IS detainees, many of them foreign fighters from up to  countries.ldquoWe canrsquot do it alone, was how it was summed up recently by Abdulkarim Omar, a leader of the Kurdish-led foreign-relations commission, which is affiliated with the US-backed SDF.ldquoEveryone is running away from the responsibility, he insisted.Like others who have visited this part of eastern Syria, I can vouch for the fact that the Kurdsrsquo fledgling administration lacks the resources and capacity to put on trial, or detain indefinitely, so many people.The Kurds then are right when they say they should not be left to shoulder this burden. Aside from recognising this, there are very sound, pragmatic and strategic reasons why it would make sense for Europe to take back its fighters.Mr Trump alluded to this last weekend when he said that the US doesnrsquot want to stand by and watch as IS fighters ldquopermeate Europe, which is where they are expected to go.While not all those fighters being held in eastern Syria are of European origin, many are. The prospect of them at some point being able to move around freely again, perhaps making their way illegally to Europe or rejoining the global ranks of IS or a similar organisation, is worrying to say the least.No doubt this was very much on the mind of the head of Britainrsquos Secret Intelligence Service , Alex Younger, when he warned ISrsquos threat is likely to ldquomorph and spread and that its threat is ldquodefinitely not done while attending the Munich security conference over the last few days.Mr Younger also cautioned about showing triumphalism at the demise of IS, something Mr Trump, of course, is already doing by declaring a ldquo per cent victory.This is where Mr Trump is wrong and, indeed, his triumphalism flies in the face of a recent report by his own US Department of Defence that warns an ldquoeffective, clandestine IS organisation appears to be taking hold.In describing the future course of IS, counter-terrorism officials speak of an ldquoatomised, clandestine network of cells with a decentralised chain of command.This is the reality faced on the ground so, while Mr Trump is wrong to talk of all-out ldquovictory, hersquos right in voicing concerns over the potential capacity of IS fighters currently detained being recycled into the jihadi cause and ranks.For this reason alone the British Governmentrsquos reluctance to take back UK nationals who have served with IS or supported their ranks in Syria and Iraq is incredibly short sighted.Evidently, itrsquos at odds too with the kind of thinking expressed by Britainrsquos head of overseas intelligence.As its stands, the options are simple. Either run the risk of leaving those UK nationals in Syria and them rejoining IS as it goes back to its roots and re-galvanises itself as an insurgency ndash or bring them back.In so doing they would effectively be taken out of circulation and an opportunity to glean invaluable intelligence gained. Adding to these considerations too is recognising the importance of having those accused of atrocities stand trial and,convicted, facing punishment.Time and again IS has shown its capacity for strategic retreats in hard times only to rebound when circumstances change.As the MI chief made clear a few days ago: ldquoThe military defeat of the caliphate does not represent the end of the terrorist threat that we face.Itrsquos time the UK Government woke up and recognised the long-term implications of any decision it makes not to bring back its nationals who fought for the jihadists.Itrsquos time it listened to Mr Trump on that point at least, evenit should ignore his boast of ldquovictory over IS."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-the-eu-has-much-less-to-lose-from-a-no-deal-brexit-than-the-uk","story":"The main problem with a no-deal Brexit is that apart from seeing a large fleet of lorries assembled in an airfield in Kent we have no idea as to how a no-deal Brexit will impact on the UK. We are assured that we will simply revert to the position that applied in  prior to joining the EU and that it will be a simple matter of implementing World Trade Organisation rules.As far as the European Union is concerned it will be relatively simple to deal with a no-deal Brexit since the United Kingdom will be added to the list of countries not in the union and trade terms that currently apply to non-member countries will then apply to the UK. In the case of the UK we presumably will want to reap the benefit of being able to trade with the entire worldwithout the restrictions currently imposed by the EU.

That was on June , , almost three years ago. What has been done in all that time to prepare for leaving without a deal  She has never told us. It should have been straightforward to begin then to prepare for that event given the acknowledged determination of the EU to punish us for leaving, expressed the world over, even in the papers produced by Michel Barnier  Co, asit were proper conduct and only changed when complained of. Of course, they intended to punish us for leaving to discourage other EU countries from following us. Time and again the hysterical Remainers have grabbed the floor to terry everyone into some kind of deal, even a bad one. Yet a no deal Brexit was the strongest card in our hand. The one that might have ensured a deal that made sense.Instead, the deal she has been forced to accept and they now refuse to alter is completely unworkable, ties us hand and foot and leaves us far worse off than we were before we decided to leave. That was not what we voted to leave for.Most of the decisions have yet to be settled. Disputes are to be resolved by the EU court asits impartiality is a given. Nonsense! No court on the planet is ever wholly impartial and in this case, the EU will give us a few crumbs to suggest fairness while keeping the plums for themselves. Emmanuel Macron has already refused to sign unless Frenchmen are allowed to continue to fish our waters. The Spanish want Gibraltar and wont sign unless they get it. They have said this and they have a veto over the deal along with every one of the others, whose price may yet be even worse. This has been swept under the carpet, like the redactions in the \"summary\" of legal advice the government wanted hidden and only released the full document when forced to do so in December , bringing about the Government being held in contempt ndash the first time in  years. Morally, that was a disgrace. Mrs May has led the worst government in forty years! And it continues, day after day, so that we cannot recognise our Parliament as anything but a shambles. Her Government has failed and is heading for the wire, hoping that enough frightened MPs will allow her rotten deal to be voted for.She set out to lead the country to leave the EU. She was resolute, polite and that was not good enough. The men in the EU played with her like cats with a mouse. All she can hope for is to be known as the worst Prime Minister in history: the one who set out to free us of the EU and left us worse off than we had ever been. There is only one thing to do: leave with no deal. Then and only then can we secure our freedom to make deals the world over, control our borders, our fisheries and colonies like Gibraltar, that rightly view themselves as British. We need to show our courage brace ourselves to be at our best again. No deal is no disaster but an opportunity to control our own destiny.William Scott, Argyle Place, Rothesay.ON October , , Enoch Powell pleaded with the delegates to the Tory Party Conference in Brighton to reject entry to what was to become the European Union, saying: \"I do not believe that this nation, which has maintained and defended its independence for a thousand years, will now submit to see it merged or lost.

But isnrsquot it a shame Scotlandrsquos politics rarely has the same effect  Instead, in the last few days, this blessed country has seen yet more bitter debate about nationalism and the views of one nationalist in particular, Andrew Wilson. Mr Wilson, you will remember, was the man behind the SNPrsquos Growth Commission last year, so we should pay attention.The most controversial bit of Mr Wilsonrsquos most recent pronouncement for hard nationalists is his support for ldquosoft independence. Some nationalists would like to move immediately to a Marxist state, he says, but the party should try to create a  for a softer independence that might win broad support. ldquoThe reality, he says, ldquois change of such signicance in any organisation, let alone a major country, is a process rather than an event.Mr Wilson does not go into great detail about what he means by a soft break-up, but I think he may be onto something and, strangely, I think The Thirty-Nine Steps and John Buchan can help. Most fans of Buchan know he had a strong romantic bond with his homeland ndash you can tell that from the descriptions of Galloway in The Thirty-Nine Steps they may also know that he once said, ldquoevery Scotsman should be a Scottish nationalist. But the important point is he was a very particular type of nationalist and, crucially for Mr Wilsonrsquos idea of soft independence, itrsquos one that still exists in great numbers today.The speech Buchan gave during a debate in the Commons in  while he was an MP gives a more detailed idea of his views. The subject was home rule for Scotland, which at the time was attracting more supportand in the end, Buchan told the Commons he did not back a Scottish parliament. However, he also said thatit could be proved it would be advantageous, then Scots should support it.Read More:Andrew Wilson: SNP should back soft version of independenceThis is a pretty clear example of the kind of nationalism Buchan preferred: you might call it patriotic pragmatism, although perhaps therersquos a better way to describe a slice of Scottish opinion that has been somewhat forgotten. In a new biography of her grandfather to be published in April, Ursula Buchan also attempts to capture the novelistrsquos views and settles on an interesting description. John Buchan wasnrsquot a unionist, she says, but he wasnrsquot a nationalist either. He was a ldquounionist nationalist with concentric, not warring, loyalties.I realise that in the current climate, ldquounionist nationalist is a confusing term, but I also think itrsquos the right one for Buchan and other Scots with similar views. Not only that, I think the SNP is unlikely to attract greater support until they better understand how ldquounionist nationalists think. Thankfully, Buchanrsquos  speech is helpful in this regard because he explains it perfectly.First of all, the unionist nationalist is just as likely as any SNP supporter to have romantic views about Scotland ndash in Buchanrsquos words, nationalism on romantic or historical grounds is ldquoperfectly respectable. The unionist nationalist is also likely to believe decisions about Scotland should be made in Scotland or with Scotlandrsquos consent. To quote Buchan again,therersquos something wrong with Scotland, itrsquos the business of Scots to put it right.However, Scots in the mould of Buchan are not just nationalists, theyrsquore internationalists and they would reject putting a nationrsquos interests first whatever the consequences, as in ldquoAmerica First or ldquoScotland First. Buchan put it this way: ldquoit would be a bad dayScottish MPs ever came to support a measure which was for the moment good for Scotland, but was demonstrably bad for England hellip or the world. This is a critical point and explains why the SNPrsquos ldquoStanding up for Scotland slogan rings hollow for some voters.Which brings us to possibly the most important quality of the unionist nationalist, which is that they keep their romantic nature in balance with their pragmatic side and make decisions on what they see as the economic facts. Buchan said Scotland was a nation in the closest corporate alliance with her southern neighbour, and that to attempt to separate them would be a costly blunder. ldquoI do not believe, he said, ldquoand no Scotsman believes, in spending money without a proper .Read More:Joanna Cherry joins attack on softest possible independence planIn writing his report last year, Andrew Wilson seems to have understand all of this his awareness of the concerns of those who might be described as unionist nationalists also explains his call for slow progress towards a soft independence ndash the question is how soft it has to be. Admittedly, some unionist nationalists will never support complete independence, particularlyit is done precipitately, but perhaps they could be persuaded to support something lighter, a third way in which Scotland loosens the ties of the union until the point where it would be economically harmful ndash in other words, it would remain at least as close to the rest of the UK as the UK used to be with EU, although possibly much closer.I realise Mr Wilson has something much more like traditional independence in mind, but I think he should at least give John Buchanrsquos speech a read. Among other things, Buchan warned against ldquoarticial nationalism which manufactures dferences, but more importantly he promoted ldquosane nationalism based on what is economically good for the country. At the time, many Scots would have agreed with him. I think many Scots still do."},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-peter-capaldi-delights-fans-at-charity-signing","story":"The former Doctor Who star spent nine hours meeting  fans in Edinburgh over the weekend, stopping only once for a -minute break.Capaldi was appearing at Capital Sci-Fi Con, anot-for-profit sci-fi, movie and pop culture event which raises money Childrenrsquos Hospices Across Scotland .Donatinghis entire autograph fee to CHAS, the actor stayed an hour after the convention had closed on Saturday to meet fans who had queued to see him.He even treated fans to a rendition of David Bowies Star Man on the guitar.#PeterCapaldi playing Starman by David Bowie on #CapitalSciFiCon in Edinburgh##part ## I died@supportCHAS pic edpAeohGSOther from the weekend include special appearances from Star Wars and Harry Potter star Warwick Davis and Scottish comics talent like Frank Quitely and Gary Erskine.Laura Campbell, Senior CHAS Community Fundraiser, said: ldquoKeith and his team of lsquocauseplayersrsquo are a phenomenal group of fundraisers.

Connelly has worked in traffic control since  so theres not much he hasnt seen. The Beast from the East brought the worst weather conditions hes encountered during his many years of service. The team is both proactive and reactive in its mission to keep Scotland’s roads moving – planning for issues it can see coming and responding quickly to those that it can’t.Partnerships play an essential role in the day-to-day operations here.For example, we’re sitting in the resilience room where Transport Scotland, the Scottish Government agency which oversees our transport industry, meets during major crises, such as the Beast from the East.It is here, too, where action plans are drawn up to cope with major events on the annual calendar or roadworks on vital routes.A Police Scotland officer is based in the centre at peak times, along with Traffic Scotland’s media officers who Tweet updates throughout the day and INRIX, a radio team which transmits travel updates, both on the website and to most of our radio stations.From September to April, a MET office employee is also based in the centre.But Traffic Scotland has many more partners behind the scenes too.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"It looks likely that the council will raise the areas Council Tax rates by three per cent\"  Counterfeit cash alert after incidents reported in Fe viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Stein explained: “We work closely with event organisers to ensure people get to the Open or Royal Highland Show with as little disruption as possible, particularly when two major events are on at the same time.“We also work with the road operating companies, Freight Haulage Association and public transport providers, such as Abellio Scotrail. We co-ordinate road and rail works to minimise the impact for commuters and the Scottish economy.”With all of the country’s roadside SOS calls also being answered at the centre, there are few down times.It’s a round-the-clock job and often a tough one, with operators witnessing incidents that take a toll.Even Stein, despite his many years in the job, isn’t immune.He explained: “Operators can take a call from someone saying they’re going to jump off the Erskine Bridge, pan the camera round and see them jumping. That can really stay with someone.“One that sticks in my mind was an accident at Charing Cross in Glasgow.“The car was a mess and as we panned the camera round we saw a child’s car seat, empty, on the road.“The room fell quiet but nothing was said. Later on, the police told us there were no fatalities and no children had been hurt – the sense of relief here was amazing.”Staff have access to counselling, should they need it as a result of anything they’ve witnessed.But you get the sense of a camaraderie among the team too which undoubtedly helps get them through the tough days.Last February and March, the Beast from the East proved a real challenge – some operators didn’t make it home for days, while others couldn’t make it in.Stein was at the helm through it all, steering the ship through the worst road conditions witnessed in Scotland in a generation.He said: “It was pretty bad in  but the Beast from the East is the worst weather I’ve ever experienced.“Usually, we can marshall maintenance teams and gritters from one part of the country to help in other areas hit by severe weather. That just wasn’t possible. “I was camped out here for five days, as was Humza Yousaf, the then transport minister. The operators couldn’t get home either so they just got on with the job, like they always do.“It was the first red weather warning in Scotland – everyone learned from it.”A Hilltip Icestriker from Finland is now being trialled on the M to ensure recovery teams can access incidents and an electric powered spreader has been deployed on the M.As for daily operations, the public also has an important role to play.“We have just over  CCTV cameras on km of roads,” said Stein. “It’s not a lot to cover such a large area.“So the public are often our eyes and ears, alerting us to breakdowns so we can send out a recovery team.“We get a lot of thank you letters as a result.”Those worried about big brother watching need not fear either.Stein added: “We don’t record number plates or incidents, unless the police ask us to.“So while we get a lot of requests, we can’t help solicitors looking for accident recordings – we don’t have them.”Crossing over the Forth is now far more reliableTraffic Scotland’s National Control Centre was opened on April , , by then depute first minister Nicola Sturgeon. Also used as a contact and education centre for pupils to find out more about the £. billion Queensferry Crossing, thousands of children visited to get a bird’s eye view as the project unfolded. At . miles , it is the longest bridge of its type in the world and also the tallest, towering mhigh. But has it eased congestion for those travelling along the east coast artery between Fe and Edinburgh According to Traffic Scotland statistics, the crossing is very much doing the job it was intended for.Since September , there have been  occasions when the Forth Road Bridge would have been closed to high-sided vehicles due to high winds.Wind shielding on the new crossing enabled it to remain open, affording far more reliability for commuters and hauliers who regularly use it.The hard shoulder on the new bridge also means there are no longer lane closuresvehicles breakdown along its span.Stein said: “The crossing’s improved reliability is delivering benefits not only for commuters but for businesses and the wider Scottish economy too.”"},{"url":null,"title":"crossing borders with your dog after brexit","story":"A.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution.

If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

This was despite the fact that the name and address of the person they needed to contact — his mother Edna — was engraved on the memorial.#Vandals couldn#t have done a better job,# he said.Following this wave of public concern, OIC convener Harvey Johnston and chief executive Alistair Buchan have now released a statement apologising for the concern and upset that this project has caused.#Following a tragic accident involving a young child at a Glasgow cemetery, the Scottish Government asked councils to carry out detailed inspections in the interests of public safety,# they said.#We therefore engaged in the kirkyard safety programme for all the right reasons, but recognise that the process we have followed needs to be improved. It was never envisaged that the resulting work would leave kirkyards in the condition they are in. We are sorry about the concern and upset this has led to.#As a caring organisation, responsive to public concern, we will restore kirkyards to the condition people would expect. We will also consider how best to contact and discuss the remedial work required with those concerned. People’s safety is an important concern for us and we will continue to carry out headstone inspections. As at Warebeth , we will use blue pegs to mark stones identied as being unsafe and highlight these to local community representatives.#These stones will not be touched until we publicise the inspection results and give relatives the time they need to discuss with us any work they might wish to carry out themselves.#The statement also confirmed that further updates from the council will be provided further updates over the weeks ahead.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work. Through the games we’ve designed, attendees will be able to competitively play roles on both sides of a cyber-crime. This offers a unique perspective that can show just what preventative measures can be taken to outsmart these online criminals.”To learn more about the Cyber Sense on Tour event and to book a free place, visit www.hellodigital.scot cyber-sense- copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It was a beautul thing and I cherished it for years. But I remember one of the strange things about that Christmas was going back to school.It must have been primary  or , and we had a group discussion in class about what Santa had brought us all.At the time, I wondered why so many of my classmates had asked for what I innocently termed “boring” things, like a new coat.Years later however, when Christmas began to bite into my own budget, I realised that my child’s vision of the world had not seen the real signicance of the gts.I do not come from a particularly well-off background.For the first decade and a half of my le we lived in a house rented from the housing association.We didn’t have a lot but I had both a new coat and a bike that year.I’m not sure but I think that memory had a lot to do with my recent determination to be my party’s spokesperson on the Department of Work and Pensions .Oh some witty person – probably one of my sisters – will say it’s more to do with me getting closer to my pension.But as any WASPI woman will tell you, that’s not as close as it used to be, which is an argument for another day.No. Every week constituents come to me who have been given what can best be termed as “the run around” by some section of the DWP.: Amber Rudd: Families on universal credit did have to use food banksIt could be pensions, it could be Universal Credit or it could be the system of Personal Independence Payments for those with a disability which, as assessment systems go, is not fit for purpose.In every one of them, I see someone who deserves to be treated better.In each case I’m reminded that in this, the fth richest nation on earth, there are still people for whom le is a daily economic challenge.And what we often overlook is that the majority of those who find themselves facing an uphill financial struggle are already working for a living – the ‘just about managing’ to whom Theresa May promised so much in her first speech as Prime Minister.In a meeting this week with the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, I was stunned to hear that of the already unacceptable number of children living in poverty in this country, two-thirds are from working households.How are we getting it so wrong in this country I have written in this newspaper before about my frustrations at the problem in our country’s welfare system, of which we were once so proud.I have criticised the management of the changes in state pension age for women.And I have railed at the issues with the well-intentioned but fatally underfunded Universal Credit.Only this week the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Amber Rudd, admitted that its failings have been responsible for sending so many people to food banks.But the crux of my gripe is that I realise that we have slipped very far from the fair society, backed by a strong economy, we aim to be.: Rudd urged to ditch DWP policies after damning UN reportOne half of that, the former, we have managed to achieve. The other still seems to be tantalisingly out of our reach. And it needn’t be.I am not in Government. ButI were, the first thing I would do in my new post would be to act on that recognition which Amber Rudd is the first in the Cabinet to publicly acknowledge.I would put back the £ billion which George Osborne took out of the budget for Universal Credit.Then I would pause the roll-out and migration from legacy benefits and fix the obvious problems that are leaving families with nothing to live on for more than a month, causing people to fall into rent arrears and adding stress to an already intolerable burden.After that, I would address the issues which still allow situations where the benefits of getting a job are undermined.But, more than anything , I would want to do something about those children in poverty.I thought about them this week and I thought about that Christmas when I was no more than eight or nine years old.At that time, le was simple for me.I had a big loving family and any financial challenges my parents might have faced were well hidden from us.For my younger sisters, it was slightly dferent.When my dad died at the age of , we went overnight from being relatively well off and living in a home we owned to a single-parent family with no income. My mum went back out to work and somehow managed to give my sisters everything I had known.But, at the age of , I realised how easy it is to fall through the cracks.Then, like now, I thought about those kids in my class that Christmas.Most of them had at least as much potential as I did, but not all of them got to fulfill it.Today that thought as much as,not more than, any political principle I have is what drives my daily le. I have been lucky. I have been able to give my daughter the start in le my parents were able to give me.Maybe because of that I want every child to have the opportunity to fulfill their potential, and feel it’s up to those of us who have to make sure it happens.No family should have to choose between Christmas presents and keeping warm.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LOVAT-V-SKYE-9.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football.

It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

After giving the matter some thought, Squinter has been unable to separate two candidates, and so the prize is jointly awarded. First co-winner is Andrea Leadsom, Tory Leader of the House, for her reaction to Donald Tusk’s statement that there’s “a special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit “without a sketch of a plan”.Andrea’s response was rather more temperate than that of Sammy Wilson, who opined that Mr Tusk was a “devilish, trident wielding, euro maniac”. She remarked, with what would appear at first blush to be commendable restraint: “The man has no manners.”But on hearing Andrea’s mention of the word “manners”, a little bell went off somewhere deep in Squinter’s hippocampus and after a short period of beard-scratching and pencils-sucking, it came to Squinter why the Honourable Member is on rather thin ice when it comes to matters of polite conduct.Come back in time with Squinter to the summer of , just two weeks before Britain voted to leave the EU. Andrea was locked in a battle with Theresa May for leadership of the Conservative Party. In an interview with The Times, when asked why the party should opt for her, she replied that her rival “possibly has nieces, nephews, lots of people. But I have children who are going to have children who will directly be part of what happens next.”So there we have it. Andrea pitched for the top job by saying having children gives her more of a stake in the country. At which point, we should remind ourselves that Theresa May has spoken honestly and movingly about the fact that she and her husband Philip were unable to have children.Manners  Yih pays yer money…Joint winner is British Transport Secretary Chris Grayling who announced on Friday that he was cancelling the £ million contract he had awarded to Seaborne Freight just before Christmas to provide a ferry service from Ramsgate to Ostend to ease the pressure on the port of Dover should the UK crash out with no deal.Mr Grayling’s tenure has been one of the great comedy shows of British politics and it’s widely believed that he remains in office only to direct fire away from more senior colleagues. Not that he could have seen this mess developing. After all, Seaborne Freight was a highly respected company with a long history of professional and responsible conduct in the business of ferries and freight, right  Well, since the company only hit the news in December you probably don’t need Squinter to remind you that Seaborne Freight:• Was a completely new company• Didn’t own a ship• Cut and pasted its website terms and conditions from a pizza delivery firmand an online boutiqueThe high-flying cabinet minister sent out to back Grayling when the contract was scrubbed was Communities Secretary James Brokenshire. You know, the bloke was Secretary of State here for a while and nobody noticed.Chris’ll be gone by the end of the week, then.Fail to prepare#LET’S be honest, Jim Wells isn’t flavour of the month within the DUP. The South Down MLA had the party whip withdrawn last spring after he fell out with the top brass over his claim that they had reneged on a promise to reinstate him as Health Minister after he stepped down in  over an election hustings row.Jimbo claimed then party leader party leader Peter Robinson promised to reinstate him when andthe furious furoreblew over . He further alleged that when Arlene Foster took over as leader she ignored two written requests from him to honour Peter’s pledge. These days Jimbo’s something of a voice in the wilderness, technically still a DUP MLA but shorn of any authority to speak for the party. Which makes him of considerable interest to journalists, since the resentment he clearly still feels makes him a little bit more willing to open up about things than other DUP reps.Jim’s been at it again this week and, given the state we’re in at the moment, you’ll probably not be surprised to hear that it’s Brexit-related. Jim revealed that at the extraordinary meeting at which the party decided to back Leave in the months leading up to the EU referendum in , there was zero discussion of what a Leave vote would mean for the local economy. This would be an awkward revelation for most parties, but after the tsunami of controversies that the DUP has been through in the past couple of years, it seems to have reached the point that its brand is so polluted the tin can’t get any more dented, the label any dirtier. But that’s not the disaster that it would certainly be for any other party because the DUP’s substantial vote clearly consists of people who don’t care what they get up to as long as they’re not Sinn Féin.Lack of planning – it’ll do for ye every time. Fail to prepare, prepare to fail, that’s the old saying and nowhere does it ring more true than in the crazy world of Brexit. Let’s take a look at a few of the most notorious failures of a lack of foresight and seewe can work out where the DUP Brexit calamity fits in…Betamax’Member when video cassettes were the most exciting innovation in the history of technology  You don’t  Well, you must be under , so let’s seewe can explain. Two Japanese giants of the global electronics industry were caught up in the race to win control of the massive new market. JVC produced the eventually successful VHS format, while Sony produced the toploading Betamax system. Although the Betamax system was of a superior picture quality, it was considerably more expensive and had a shorter recording time. At a meeting in , Sony were advised by Matsushita engineers to switch to the VHS format, but declined. It wa a historic mistake, dealing the company a crippling financial blow from which it would take years to recover.Ford EdselFord were inordinately pleased with the Edsel, a new model released in the United States in , the year after the Ford family relinquished control of the company. The Edselwas designed to give Ford the upper-hand in the highly competitive premium intermediate market . The company missed the design boat, though, as the car harked back to an earlier age at a time when families were increasingly turning to compact vehicles. The Edsel was discontinued two years later, with sales signicantly less than half the break-even sales figure. Executives took their eye off the ball and didn’t realise the Edsel was flopping until over .bnhad been spent on design, manufacture and new dealerships. To this day, new models that fail are still referred to in the US automobile market as ‘Edsels’.New CokeIn the mid-s, as other soft drinks were increasingly threatening the dominance of Coca-Cola, the company decided it was going to ditch the original Coke formula and go with an improved ‘New Coke’.The  launch was a disaster and sales were badly hit, particularly in the southern states where Coca-Cola was considered an integral part of American culture. Tens of thousands of complaints flooded into company HQ weekly. The problem was not so much with the taste – the company had disastrously underestimated the hold that the Coca-Cola brand had on the American psyche. Smelling blood, rivals Pepsi began a new ad campaign with the strapline ‘Now I Know Why Coke Did It’ . Fans started booing ads for New Coke at large sports events. Just  days after New Coke was launched, the company announced that it was bringing back the old formula.Has to be a Brexit message in there somewhere, no "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-13.55.54.png","title":"eye on the past february","story":"RUC men sided with loyalist strikers last MayA SECRET memo prepared by British army intelligence has revealed that senior RUC men were closely involved with the Ulster Workers’ Council strike last May.The memo, prepared for Whitehall ministers some time ago, shows also that unormed members of the RUC “connived at and assisted with the maintenance of UWC and UDA roadblocks”.Referring to Special Branch actions during the strike the report says: “Co-opted personnel were isolated from information on events by being sent on routine tasks or being given rest days.”The ‘co-opted personnel’ referred to are Special Branch men recruited by British military intelligence to keep an eye on what is happening within the Special Branch.“As a result a ally clear picture of RUC reliability area by area has not emerged,” says the report.And it goes on to say that RUC activity of a routine nature appears to have failed by as much as  per cent.It goes on to predict that in a situation where there were large scale attacks on the Catholic population  per cent of the Special Branch would throw their weight behind loyalist gangs. A copy of the report, which was prepared as a briefing document for ministers in the Wilson Government, found its way into the hands of a number of journalists in London recently.Besides casting considerable doubt on the loyalty of the RUC to the British Government it claims that  to  per cent of the UDR could be regarded as hostile during a doomsday situation.BRITISH military policemen are being trained for civilian duties at a military training camp in Kent and it is believed that a large number of them will be drafted into Belfast and Derry within the next few weeks.The British Redcaps are expected to be used in areas like Falls and Andersonstown to take over from infantry patrols which will be withdrawn from the street.A number of UDR men from the thBattalion have attended a two-week course at the same camp and one report suggests that they may be used to form the nucleus of a ‘community police force’ in Belfast for a trial period. There have been two previous attempts to phase in military policemen to civilian duties. In the Bogside area of Derry they were withdrawn after a few days because of resistence by local people.Price sisters’ lives threatenedTHE Prisoners’ Aid Committee in London has said it is concerned about the safety of Irish political prisoners in British jails because “there is evidence of systematic victimisation by prison authorities and attempts to create hostility among other prisoners.”According to the PAC the Price sisters’ lives have been threatened by prisoners in Durham Jail. Since Christmas seven Irish prisoners have been ‘arbitarily’ moved to prisons far away from their families and another Irish prisoner’s cell has been set on fire. Officially the Home Office would not comment on the allegations but other sources firmly rejected them as being completely unfounded. There was nothing unusual in prisoners being moved to other jails under the nomal “dispersal systems”, they said.Since being transferred to the women’s wing of Durham from Brixton Prison, London, Dolours and Marion Price have been put on dferent floors in dference parts of the wing, the PAC statement said. The reason given by a deputy governor, Miss Ford, for the separation was “security”.The PAC said that the cells to which the sisters were moved were filfthy.The PAC said that in a letter to their father, the sisters said that their lives had been threatened by other prisoners all of whom were in need of medical treatment, some being “drug addicts or sex perverts”. They are being “continually harassed” by short-term prisoners, who wanted information to try to sell stories about the girls to newspapers, the statement said.“They have asked to be separated from Judith Ward, whose behaviour is bizarre, but Marion has been put into the neighbouring cell to this prisoner. Despite the fact that the Home Office describes Durham as a top security prison, Dolours and Marion and Judith Ward, are the only Category A prisoners there.“The other  prisoners in the women’s wing are Category C and they subject the girls to continuous anti-Irish abuses and obscenities. Miss Ford, the deputy governor, has instructed them to associate with these prisoners, although some of them have threatened to poision the Price sisters’ food. The families are complainning to the Home Office about the treatment of Mr Price and Mrs Claire Murphy, the girls’ sister, by Miss Ford on their last two visits. This treatment represents a marked worsening of prisoner attitudes from that of the prison staff in Brixton where the girls were during their hunger-strike.”Pay rise for home helpsHOME helps in the Andersonstown areas who were threatening strike action some months ago have just been given a big pay rise.The new rate for the job, which paid only p per hour this time last year, has climbed to p.After the reorganisation of local government services home helps who were working in the Antrim County Council area protested that they were being paid p an hour less than colleagues who were working in the area formerly controlled by Belfast Corporation.In some parts of Andersonstown women working within a hundred yards of each other were being paid at rates which were   p dferent.A pay rationalisation last December by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board, which now controls the district’s home helps, brought all of the women’s pay up to a standard rate of p per hour.Most of the women work at least ten hours per week, with the average time spent looking after old and housebound people being around  hours.Local Ads in paperPAULA’S Glen Road Shopping CentreLadies and Children’s Outfitters.

The reality is a number of them have been there for years.\"Ms Millar said that it was in the unions view a \"cynical ploy\" to keep agency workers \"in their place\".She continued: \"They are not able to access proper public sector pensions nor access mortgages or make long term financial commitments - they are stuck in a time warp.\"This is not the fault of the many hard working dedicated agency staff who want a proper permanent job.\"NIPSA continues to raise this issue for proper workforce planning for the NICS and other public sector employers.\"Ulster Unionist MLA Steve Aiken said his party had expressed concerns at the time about how the voluntary exit scheme was being rolled out.\"Not only was it giving large sums of public money to some people who would have already been shortly leaving the Northern Ireland Civil Service anyway, but its chaotic rollout saw thousands of others leave in a totally unco-ordinated manner,\" he said.\"Essential positions were becoming vacant and departments and bodies simply had no choice but to fill them again, and often the only source of staff were agencies.\"Lessons must be learnt so that those same mistakes are never made again.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37805127.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/ballycastle-cliffs_002.jpg","title":"pictured madness as youths scale northern ireland cliffs without safety gear","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The surfaces are in poor condition and very dficult.\"I would call for those doing this to stop.\"Ryan Gray Senior Maritime Operations Officer for HM Coastguard added: \"The recent photos taken at Ballycastle are concerning, we want people to enjoy themselves at the coast by making sure their visit is one to remember and not one they’d rather forget.\"We strongly recommend you do not attempt to climb up or down clfs unless you are properly equipped and trained to do so, and don’t attempt to climb clfs as a short cut. If unequipped for a climb it only takes one slip or a loose rock for it to end in tragedy. Remember,you think someone might be in trouble along the coast or out at sea please call  and ask for the Coastguard.\""},{"url":null,"title":"reimburse ratepayers for 1500 table at dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The council has undertaken to review its policy on attendance at gala dinners and will consider the approach taken by other local authorities. However, the proposed new policy does not specy spending limits.Sinn Fein councillor Patrice Hardy has previously said when she initially raised concerns that ratepayers’ money may have been used to fund the DUP, they were dismissed by the council.“I was forced to submit Freedom of Information requests and to ask the Electoral Commission to intervene, simply to try and get answers as to how ratepayers’ money was being used by the council,” she said.Ms Hardy added that “ it is the case that council officers knowingly breached their own policy in order to pay this money, that is a very serious matter”.Under Electoral Commission rules, local authorities are not considered “permissible donors” to political parties. Money from such bodies must be ed.The council said in a statement last night: “Elected members at full council in August  agreed, without objection, to purchase this table and the event was attended by elected members from dferent political parties, senior officers and representatives from the agri-food sector across the borough to avail of the opportunity to discuss first-hand with the minister their issues and concerns in relation to the agri-food sector post-Brexit.“Council was requested to make payment to the Tullyglass Hotel and did so electronically.” Causeway Coast and Glens Council also paid £, for a table at the dinner."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37812018.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/kill.jpg","title":"ulster woman set alight by candle during mass saved by gaa star","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs Mitchell explained that following her sonrsquos death, his owed back pay from the Army would have settled the debt.The soldierrsquos mother also revealed that he had told her about two incidents in Afghanistan which had upset him.In one of them, he had been due to be the soldier at the front of the patrol but was swapped with a colleague at the last minute. The soldier who replaced him subsequently suffered severe leg injuries in an attack.Mrs Mitchell also told the inquest that towards the end of , her son had become hyper vigilant, confided in her less, was jumpy and struggled to sleep.She described how he had successfully applied for his ldquodream job in the Army as an outdoor instructor, explaining this had involved undertaking courses in the UK, Spain and Germany which left him very tired.The soldierrsquos mother also described how her son had felt isolated after a knee injury held him back from joining his unit in Afghanistan, and instead had to serve with a dferent unit.She said that when he ed to Ballykinlar and the new job, he continued to feel isolated as a number of soldiers were taking redundancy at that time.ldquoEverything hit him at that precise moment. He thought everyone was leaving, he was exhausted, his back pay hadnrsquot come through, he had had a row with Cherand he had just got back after being away for a long time.Mrs Mitchell added that she did not blame the army for her sonrsquos death but felt more could have been done to help him.A statement form Rleman Mitchellrsquos friend, Kendall Gibson, also referred to an incident when the  year-old ran away from fireworks.ldquoHe said the fireworks reminded him too much of Afghanistan, stated Mr Gibson, adding that he was also concerned about his friendrsquos drinking.Three soldiers mdash friends of Rleman Mitchell mdash who had discovered his body were sent twice to another barracks in Lisburn for treatment which included counselling.The inquest also heard that it was common place for soldiers to refer to the local army base as ldquoBally-kill-yourself.Driving instructor William Riley, who had been taking Lance Corporal Ross for HGV lessons in the week before his suspected suicide, told the inquest that the soldier was one of many who used the term.Mr Riley told how the Lance Corporal had cut a ldquofrustratedrsquo figure in the week before his death, displayed an attitude problem and had been involved in a verbal altercation with another instructor two days before his death.The inquest continues..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Art","story":"A HIGHLY acclaimed Downpatrick-based charity has secured a signicant financial boost from the Department of Justice.The Le Change, Changes Lives organisation mdash based in Market Street mdash has secured a slice of a near poundm funding cake made available under the government departmentrsquos assets recovery scheme.Over poundm has been distributed to organisations across the province since the schemersquos launch in , with the Downpatrick charity aiming to use its pound, three-year funding package to provide its clients with basic food hygiene training, alongside cooking participation and demonstration skills.The charity helps and supports people suffering with a range of mental health issues and addiction problems, offering professional and confidential counselling, mental health and addiction support and suicide intervention services.It also works to help minimise social isolation, alongside encouraging wellness and recovery and family support.Since its launch, Le Change Changes Lives has provided opportunities for people with a iety of problems to engage in constructive activities, including giving new le to old furniture through the very successful Pop Up Art initiative.The money secured under the assets recovery scheme, which is managed by the Policing and Community Safety Partnership, will finance the charityrsquos No Lost Cause project.Charity officials say the project is designed to provide an ldquointergenerational ersionary and therapeutic community programme which aims to encourage disadvantaged and disengaged people to find their potential and build upon it, using activities, counselling, advocacy, training and support.A logo is being used to publicise the project inspired by the lsquoNot Waving but Drowningrsquo poem by Stevie Smyth which is often told in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. It gives an account of a drowned man whose distressed thrashing in the water was mistaken for waving.Charity officials say the No Lost Cause initiative is designed to complement the highly successful Pop Up Art project which is funded by the Big Lottery until this October.Over the le of the No Lost Cause project, charity officials will strive to reduce crime through erting people away from substance abuse and associated links to criminal activity.Le Change, Changes Lives officials have confirmed that the new project also aims to reduce reoffending by providing training and skills development activities and counselling to deal with substance and relationship family issues and provide support to improve the self-esteem of participants to help them re-engage with family and communities.They hope that through the basic food hygiene training, cooking participation and demonstration project that it will help parents revive cooking healthy, affordable family meals, to be eaten together at the kitchen table, helping achieve interaction and involvement in young peoplersquos livesAilish Teague, who helped establish the Downpatrick charity with her husband Manus, is delighted with the Department of Justice funding.She said competition to secure the money for the next three years was competitive, with groups in each of the provincersquos  councils eligible to apply.ldquoThe application was made through the Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the asset recovery is a brilliant resource, with money taken from criminals invested back into community projects, said Ailish.ldquoWe can use this money for the programmes we deliver, working closely with people who have a range of addictions.ldquoOur clients are also delighted that we have secured this funding which will enable is to deliver an NVQ Level One in hospitality services from our Market Street base with the food hygiene aspect of the course designed to give people a taste of employment.While delighted to have secured funding under the Department of Justice scheme, charity officials are conscious that their Lottery funding ends this October.Mrs Teague says officials have met with Lottery representatives and has suggested that the chances of having their funding extended are ldquozero to nil.She added: ldquoIt will be dficult to secure more Lottery funding which could leave us with no money to finance our core costs including rent and other overheads.

They were well prepared.ldquoThey had carried out research which helped them to face questions about migration and environmental issues. There was no doubt, they had been given the short straw as the other countries were ready to attack them for their current position in wanting to leave the EU.ldquoHowever, the students put aside their own views and represented the country they were delegated, in this debate.ldquoBeing the UK is what made it so challenging and also so rewarding as they did a fantastic job.Mrs Orsi said: ldquoNot being able to participate in future debates is only one of the educational detriments to leaving the EU.ldquoI think our students are going to be greatly affected on many levels, both in terms of academic opportunities, funding and employment. It is the very people who were not able to vote who will be impacted upon most.Ciara said studying A-Level politics definitely helped the girls flex some political muscle in their challenge.She added: ldquoWe have been discussing Brexit a great deal in class and we felt secure in our knowledge.ldquoHowever, what we did find challenging was trying to find out the positions of other smaller EU countries in terms of their policies on migration and the environment.ldquoI am very interested in politics and as a language student, I feel it is important we are involved in these debates to ensure we continue to develop our understanding of our European neighbours.ldquoWhat is unfortunate is the fact this might be the last time we will be asked to participate as we will no longer be a member state.The debate was organised by the British Council with the aim of developing studentsrsquo intercultural understanding of other countries while learning more about the political workings of the ious states..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch farming family feature on BBC documentary  ","story":"THE trials of farming will be shown through the eyes of a Ballynahinch family as they are featured tonight in the BBC Two series, This Farming Le.Top beef cattle breeder Geoff Rodgers allowed a film crew to capture him and his family work their -acre farm between Ballynahinch and Dromara for most of last year.Geoff inherited the farm when his father died Martin and runs it with his we, Lizzie, who is a special needs classroom assistant at Spa Primary School, with their three children, Emma , Martin , and  year-old Lucy.He admitted that he had turned down previous offers to take part in other farming shows but finally agreed to take part as he was a real fan of the show.The result is a moving insight into what it takes to care for  animals  hours a day and what happens when it all goes wrong.ldquoI think some viewers will be reduced to tears. Well, thatrsquos what happened when all of the farmers featured watched the programme a few weeks ago, said  year-old Geoff.ldquoIt will show that there is a real connection between the family and the animals and itrsquos not all just about sales or winning competitions.Two months before the crew started filming last January, the family were hit with terrible news mdash Bovine TB was discovered in their pedigree herd and  animals had to be slaughtered.A movement restriction then had to put on the herd which meant that no animals could enter or leave the farm until two consecutive TB tests prove negative.The programme catches up with the family on the day a vet calls to carry to do the next test and to determine whether any more of the herd will have to be slaughtered.ldquoIt just happened that the crew came to us in one of the most challenging times for the farm, said Geoff.ldquoAnd while I wonrsquot gave too much away, what happens not only affects me but also my children as they all get involved, especially the youngest Lucy, to help me get the animals ready for the likes of Balmoral Show.ldquoWe not only lost some of the animals but you also lose years of breeding, particularly with some of the animals my father had bred them, which was hard, and then of course, therersquos a knock-on loss of new calves.ldquoIt was particularly hard as I had buyers waiting to buy bulls and cattle of me but we couldnrsquot do anything until we got the all-clear.The tension builds over the next few episodes of the show as the deadline looms to Balmoral Show mdash the highlight of the farming calendar in Northern Ireland and the major sales day for Geoff.Viewers will see that the Rodgers familyrsquos hopes of further success at Balmoral are pinned on bull Mario, who Geoff described ldquoas a real character and his young half-sister, Nadia.This Farming Le starts tonight at pm on BBC ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"British Irish group on High Street conference  ","story":"THE impact of online sales on the High Street was discussed at a recent meeting in Newcastle.Representatives from the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly were in the resort where they were met by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin.Mr McGrath explained the committee has a dferent area of investigation each year and that in  is focusing on the impact of online sales on the High Street and how governments can deliver initiatives and projects to address the problem.The Assemblyman said with the nature of the traditional High Street changing, many people, especially the young, are shopping online with this trend only going to increase.ldquoWe are seeing and hearing that people want experiences and see their shopping trip as much more than simply shopping, wanting to incorporate food and activities as part of their experience, said Mr McGrath.ldquoHaving clean, welcoming public spaces, areas that can facilitate events and having a erse range of experiential shops and boutiques is critical in making the High Street thrive. In Newcastle, the public realm and promenade schemes, in tandem with the shop front improvement scheme, have helped the resort buck the trend and is reporting increasing footfall.Mr McGrath also highlighted the need to continue to develop experiences people can avail of to maximise footfall and is confident ambitious future proposals including a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes will be critical to enhancing what Newcastle has to offer.He continued: ldquoIn Downpatrick, the former Irish Street police station and car park have the potential to redevelop the town and breathe new live back into its retail centre.ldquoDeveloping a space here which can enhance and deliver a customer experience and product will be critical to developing new shops and products, but also complement existing businesses too.ldquoRates and the entire rating scheme was a major recurring theme from business organisations and this will form part of a report being compiled by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly following their visit.Mr McGrath said the inadequacies of the rating system were well known, with the British-Irish body, of which he is a member, keen to find other ways of helping businesses thrive.The MLA added: ldquoTimes are changing and local authorities and central governments must reflect this in the work they do. I look forward to the report our committee will deliver which will reflect on time spent in Newcastle, Belfast, Dublin, Newcastle Upon Tyne and Stockton on Tees.Cllr Murnin said he was delighted that representatives of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly view Newcastle as an example of good practice for their research into revitalising the high street.He continued: ldquoWe have worked very hard to make our district a better place to carry out business and as a place to visit. Regenerating the town centre and promenade in Newcastle has played a signicant role in increasing business and footfall to the town.

Itrsquos something I have always had to be aware of in my own le. I feel very strongly that there are issues in Northern Ireland that arenrsquot being addressed as far as mental health is concerned.A former pupil of St Malachyrsquos Primary School in Castlewellan, Niamhrsquos dficulties compounded after leaving Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch. A talented actor, who shone in the schoolrsquos theatre productions, she applied for and got a place at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardf.Niamh was fortunate that while not academically minded, she found that drama, theatre studies and English always came ldquonaturally to her in school.The youngest of five siblings, Niamh says that she had always wanted to leave Castlewellan for ldquoan adventure. But she did not realise that her living in Cardf, away from family and friends, would take such a toll on her.ldquoI was just very, very homesick because our experiences in Northern Ireland were so unique and I didnrsquot have anyone that I could explain that to, she said.ldquoI felt emotionally unsupported. I felt very much like fish out of water as I was surrounded by a lot of very wealthy people and I struggled to connect with them. I was longing for the familiarity and the closeness, and the craic of home. My homesickness lasted for many years, it didnrsquot just go away.ldquoEvery time I went home for Easter or Christmas I was in floods of tears going back to the airport but yet I made myself do it, nothing nor nobody  was forcing me to do it.She went gone to appear alongside actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame in an acclaimed production Macbeth which played Londonrsquos West End and New Yorkrsquos Broadway, as well as former X-Files star Gillian Anderson and  Shades heart-throb Jamie Dornan in the psychological murder drama The Fall.Niamh is currently working on two film projects and says that as a newly married woman, her professional and personal le is going great.However, she maintains her mental health by practicing yoga and mediation and feels it is important to be upfront about having had issues.She explained: ldquoI donrsquot see a problem talking about mental health because I donrsquot like that itrsquos still taboo. If it helps one person seek help, then thatrsquos great.ldquoPeople could be sitting with mental problems and they donrsquot know it. Because thatrsquos what anxiety and depression do, they sneak on you and it really starts to alter your view of the world without you noticing.ldquoOver time with mediation you can be in control of your mind.

Hutley was given another chance around  minutes and this time took full advantage after Enniskillen had been deemed to be offside on the back of a break from Down scrum half, Chris Gibson.For the remainder of the first half, and indeed for  minutes in the second half, the score remained at - with both teams trading blows, but neither were able to alter their account on the scoreboard.Down did have their chances to take the lead, but lacked the finesse in handling that they had shown against their rivals from Carrick and Omagh in previous rounds.As the game entered the final quarter, Enniskillen managed to extend their lead, scoring a try by barging over from short range following a well won line-out.With Enniskillen now in possession of a  point lead, Down were left with no alternative but to chase the game. Again, they created some opportunities and applied pressure in Enniskillen territory with some great carries from Josh Hanlon, Conor Moag and Joe Charles, but the dogged defence of the locals held out and with it, Down frustration grew which made putting quality attacking play together even harder.In the closing minutes and with the outcome of the fixture already beyond doubt, Enniskillen added a final unconverted try confirming them as the team who would progress to the quarter-finals.The final whistle brought bitter disappointment to the hard-working Down squad who knew they hadnrsquot been at their best on this occasion.The side now enter the Subsidiary Shield competition and they have drawn Royal School Dungannon at home in a quarter-final game to be played on Saturday, February, , at am.Having been finalists in this competition for four consecutive years and winners in , everyone at Down High knows there is plenty left to play for this season..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch horse breeder is a very disappointed man this week mdash and all because of the lsquoflu.

His parents and medical team are constantly working to ensure his lungs remain as clear of mucus as they can be.Jen said: ldquoItrsquos hard to believe when you look at him that anything is wrong as he looks so perfect, but inside him the mucus is causing havoc.ldquoDermot and I never expected to becomes nurses as well as parents to our child. We do his treatment willingly but with heavy hearts.ldquoIf the drugs didnrsquot exist, I think we could just accept things as they are and get on with our lives and make every day count.ldquoBut as it is we canrsquot rest until we have access to Orkambi and the pipeline of drugs for Lorcaacuten and all the others with cystic fibrosishere need.ldquoThis situation makes it dficult to enjoy our son without feeling pain at time passing.The couple, who live off the Vianstown Road, believe that the sooner their son starts on Orkambi the better.ldquoOrkambi not only slows the decline in lungby up to %, it also reduces hospitalisations by up to %, Jen explained.ldquoEvery day people go without access to these drugs is a day in which their body could become more damaged. Since he was  days old, Lorcaacuten has not had a single day without taking some type of antibiotic, as well as  enzymes.ldquoSome people [including young children] with CF have to attend the hospital for two weeks of IVs every three months and thatrsquos considered to be ok when there is a drug that could potentially help Families of CF sufferers believe that Orkambi can lsquostop the clockrsquo on further decline of the patient as they get older.However, the US drug company which developed it has so far failed to agree a price so that it could be introduced by the UK.Jen added: ldquoThe drugs currently in trials are supposed to give sufferers a chance at a near normal le, but this is partly dependent on them being healthy enough when they begin taking them. There is no time to wait.ldquoTwo hundred and twenty six people have died in the UK since Orkambi was licensed over three years ago. We need Orkambi and we need it now.The couple have been lobbying local politicians to get their help at keeping their campaign in spotlight in Government.Strangford MP Jim Shannon raised the plight of Lorcaacuten at Westminster this week.South Down MLAs Jim Wells and Sinead Bradley, along with Lagan Valley MLA Trevor Lunn, are planning to host a meeting in Stormont within weeks with Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.Mr Shannon said: ldquoI was contacted by people throughout Northern Ireland asking me to push government to allow a crown licence for this le-changing drug, as I have been vocal in my belief that this drug should be available on the NHS.ldquoWhat impacted me most was a mother in my area who sent me a picture of her beautul two year-old son with his little mask on, telling me that he was now old enough to get it and it would make such a dference to him.ldquoI supported the calls for the drug and will continue pushing government to find a way to overcome the issue between the drug company and NICE guidelines.While Jen says she has received local cross-party support, she is urging people to sign the petition

technology is to be used to inform peoplethe bathing water at Newcastle beach is safe to swim in.The beach is one of six across the province which features in a new EU-backed initiative to provide people with live updates of the water quality.The resortrsquos beach and surrounding river catchment area has been selected as part of a major new study, with a weather station and river water level recorders already in place to send real time data to a server which the public can access.A new electronic sign is to be erected at the Downs Road car park to provide live updates on the water quality, but the European Unionrsquos so-called SWIM project goes a step further with people able to get information via text messages and internet alerts.News of the new initiative comes just three months after it was revealed that while Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough beaches continue to enjoy some of the best bathing water quality in Europe, it was a case of lsquomust do betterrsquo for Newcastle, with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs labelling the resortrsquos water quality as ldquosufficient.Details of the SWIM project were outlined at Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.Councillors were told those involved in the scheme are working on developing a real time monitoring system, allowing local people and visitors to the beach to check the water quality via a series of measures.Council officials say the innovative project will enable what they have described as ldquoshort term pollution to be predicted.Funded by the Special EU Programmes Body, those behind the project which includes Newcastle, Castlerock, Portrush, Waterfoot, Ballyholme and Ballywalter beaches in Northern Ireland and Clogherhead, Enniscrone and Ladyrsquos Bay in the Republic, say it will help protect public health.In addition, they are confident that it will signicantly improve communication about water quality and contribute to tourism promotion in the resort.At Monday nightrsquos council meeting, Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said: ldquoThis new programme is good news for the resort and can have a positive impact on tourism.ldquoThe fact that people will have real time access to the quality of the bathing water builds confidence which is positive.ldquoThere is a problem with nitrates finding their way into the water at the beach and it is something that needs to be addressed.ldquoHowever, the fact that we will soon have a scheme which enables people to know the quality of the water before they take a dip is groundbreaking.Rowallane councillor Harry Harvey, said the decision was good news for Newcastle and could boost visitor numbers.ldquoThis is a forward step for a beach where the water quality has improved from what it was a number of years ago, he said.ldquoThe beach has yet to achieve blue flag status which in part recognises the quality of the water and it would be greatthis could be secured in the long term.ldquoWith the focus on the here and now, the provision of the electronic sign and the availability of real time information is indeed a welcome development and a forward step for the resort..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource

recently recorded a single at the iconic Abbey Road Studios, a place made famous by The Beatles.Calling the experience of recording in the same studio as The Beatles ldquosurreal, Sean explained how the opportunity arose.ldquoIrsquove just recently joined up with a guy called Rory Gallagher, hersquos from Kilcar, Donegal, and his project is called Rory and the Island for he owned the Island Bar over in Lanzarote for five or six years before he came home. He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March .

The new walls, built short and squat in the style developed in Italy in the th century to repel artillery fire, would prove their worth before long when the city was besieged.The walls occupy a permanent place in the Ulster imagination from the tales of heroism and hardship during theGreat Siege of , but the defences would be put to the test long before the Glorious Revolution brought William to the throne.The fortied city of Londonderry was a useful refuge after the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of , an attempt by the Catholic gentry to seize control of the administrative apparatus in Ireland that would ultimately descend into perhaps the most destructive conflict in Irish history, the Confederate Wars.And in , the city endured an even longer but less famous siege than the Great Siege of , when the newly formed Royalist and Parliamentary factions clashed. with DUP leader Arlene Foster in \"   with DUP leader Arlene Foster in \"  DUP deselects councillor relative of former minister Jonathan Bell Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The Parliamentary forces, under the command of Sir Charles Coote, had been embedded in Londonderryby March that year, when Royalist forces under Alexander Stewart arrived and placed the city underan eventually unsuccessful siege for five months.Despite the efforts of Sir Coote’s city defenders in holding off the larger Royalist forces, it is the first major clash in the Williamite War in Ireland that is still commemorated each year by the Protestant community.Each year, the Apprentice Boys of Derry celebrate two important dates in the city’s history, both of which are linked inextricably with the famous city walls.The first is the Shutting of the Gates, sometimes referred to as ‘Lundy’s Day’, which commemorates the decision made in early December  by  young apprentices who seized the keys to the city and shut the gates to an advancing Catholic force intent on occupying the city.The leader of the advancing force, Alexander MacDonnell, rd Earl of Antrim, decided an assault on the formidable Derry walls was unwise and withdrew.The -day Great Siege truly began in April the following year. King James himself appeared before the walls on April  to appeal directly to the city’s inhabitants, only to be greeted by a shot from the ‘Roaring Meg’ cannon and shouts of ‘No Surrender’.The siege was long and brutal but the second date commemorated by the Apprentice Boys, the Relief of the city, would come on August  when the inhabitants of the city watched the besieging forces march away in defeat.The walls were a crucial element in all these crucial moments in history.Their place in the popular imagination has undoubtedly aided their preservation across four tumultuous centuries.The Honourable the Irish Society, the original builders of the famous monument, still own the city walls and continue to take a benevolent interest in their preservation.The iconic and remarkably unchanged th century structure continues to prove a boon to Northern Ireland’s second city, as tourists from near and far flock to the famous walled city, the last of its kind remaining in Europe.l Morning View, page JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"transport","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Transport   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Transport Politics Crime Farming Education Business Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat s News News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Transport      Scottish airline Loganair keen to tender for City of Derry to Stansted routeA Scottish airline has said it is interested in taking over the Londonderry to London air route, after previous operator Flybmi went into administration at the weekend.

We look forward to receiving details of the tender process as soon as possible.”The challenges that led to Flybmi ceasing, including uncertainty around Brexit, do not impact Loganair, it said.“Loganair expects toto profit in the current financial year, is carrying record passenger numbers on many of its routes and is in a strong financial position,” managing director Jonathan Hinkles said.British Midland Regional Limited, which operated as Flybmi, said Brexit meant it had been unable to secure valuable flying contracts in Europe, but that its situation mirrors wider dficulties in regional airlines.East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell MP has been in touch with Transport Secretary Chris Grayling.“Obviously there is concern given that this is the single direct air connection between Londonderry and London,” he said.“The transport secretary indicated that he is hopeful that a new operator will agree to take on the route. There needs to be as seamless a transition as possible from Flybmi to the new operator in order that the travelling public suffer as little as possible.”Sinn Fein councillor Sandra Duffy described the loss of the flybmi flight as a “huge concern for the north-west”.Motorists to expect delays due to parade Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“This will obviously have implications for the new public service obligation flight between Derry and London as well as the new route to Manchester, all of which flybmi was due to operate,” she said.Last week, Mr Grayling confirmed the government will continue to provide funding for a flight between City of Derry Airport and London.The PSO air route, the first of its kind in NI, has been in place since . Mr Grayling said government will continue to subsidise the route until .Derry City and Strabane District Council, which helps run and subsidise the airport, said: “The council would like to reassure the public that its chief executive, senior officers from council, officials from the City of Derry Airport board and the Department for Transport have been involved in urgent discussions since the announcement was made, to assess the situation and put into place measures to secure a new operator for the route as soon as possible.”Meanwhile, City of Derry Airport advised passengers who booked flights directly with Flybmi to contact their card issuer to seek a refund, while those who have booked through a travel agent or partner airline should check their contract for what options are available to them. Those with travel insurance are being advised that they should checkthey are eligible to claim for cancelled flights.Flybmi advised that customers who booked through “a code share partner” or a booking agent should contact them directly for assistance.Code share partners are Lufthansa, Brussels Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Loganair, Air France and Air Dolomiti.Flymbmi said it was not able to find replacement flights or refund customers.Anyone who incurred hotel costs as a result of cancellations may be able to claim against their credit card under Section  of the Consumer Credit Card Act, it added.try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolMan caught with  lsquopackagesrsquo of cocaine in his body at Belfast City AirportBallymena manager David Jeffrey praised his side after their - defeat to Linfield in the BetMcLean League Cup Final.LIVE BLOG: League Cup final  - Ballymena United v Linfield          ..

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Staff would of course always have a discussion with the patient and the family with regards to the risk.ldquoIt is not possible for staff to monitor patientsrsquo property on a continuous basis and there are occasions when family members bring in additional property for patients while they are in hospital and this may include medication.ldquoThe UHB has submitted a response to the coroner and will continue to benchmark in order to find an effective solution.No new lsquoNever Eventsrsquo took place between November and December.Of the , falls reported betweenNovember  and December , % resulted in no harm, or minor harm.In December , more than  falls were reported ndash but this was the lowest monthly figure for that period.The health board is developing a strategy to reduce falls and reviewing prevention and management of bed sores.New guidance from the Welsh Government will mean fewer pressure damage incidents will be reported as lsquoSerious Incidentsrsquo, a health board report says.Patient approval remains high with the arearsquos two main hospitals as surveys suggest % are satisfied with their experience atUniversity Hospital of Llandough, and % of patients are satisfied atUniversity Hospital of Wales.A spokeswoman for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: ldquoIn line with our duty of candour we report allseriousincidentsto Welsh Government, the public and to our board in line with best practice.ldquoWelsh Government guidance requires us to report unexpected deaths of patients who are known to mental health services and die unexpectedly or experienceseriousharm in a community setting. Patients and their families are made aware ofincidentsand are kept informed during investigations and discussions with our clinical teams.ldquoThe increased reporting of pressure damage reflects a period of education and training of staff to improve the quality of data being recorded.ldquoAllincidentsare fully investigated and appropriate actions are taken to reduce the risk of recurrence in the future. This enables clinical boards and the corporate teams to identy areas of good practice but also to identy emerging trends and issues that require action in order to improve safety and quality of services. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But wersquore not waiting. We have already made substantial changes so that every political ad on Facebook has to be authorised, state who is paying for it and then is stored in a searchable archive for seven years. No other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do.ldquoWe also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users.ldquoWhile we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago. We have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to , people and invested heavily in machine learning, articial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse.In the last year Facebook has come under intense pressure over some of its business practices, following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a series of data breaches and concerns over fake news and other content on the site.The committeersquos final report into disinformation and fake news also said electoral law was ldquonot fit for purpose and should be updated to reflect the move to ldquomicrotargeted online political campaigning.They called for a comprehensive review of the current rules and regulations surrounding political work during elections and referenda, and separately urged the Government to put pressure on social media companies to publicise instances of disinformation.Ministers were also asked to reveal how many investigations are being carried out into Russian interference in UK politics.The report is the latest attempt to crack down on social media networks, and follows accusations from digital minister Margot James that some firms show little regard for the security and safety of some of their more vulnerable users.The issue has come under increased focus following the case of schoolgirl Molly Russell, who took her le aged , after her family found material relating to depression and suicide when they looked at her Instagram account following her death.The Government is expected to publish a white paper later this year on proposals to reform laws to make the internet and social media safer.Damian Collins accused big tech companies of failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content Tory MP and committee chairman Damian Collins said: ldquoDemocracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised lsquodark advertsrsquo from unidentiable sources, delivered through the major social media s we use every day. Much of this is directed from agencies working in foreign countries, including Russia.ldquoThe big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights.ldquoWe need a radical sht in the balance of power between the s and the people. The age of inadequate self-regulation must come to an end.ldquoThe rights of the citizen need to be established in statute, by requiring the tech companies to adhere to a code of conduct written into law by Parliament, and overseen by an independent regulator.Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said: ldquoLabour agrees with the committeersquos ultimate conclusion: The era of self-regulation for tech companies must end immediately. We need new independent regulation with a tough powers and sanctions regime to curb the worst excesses of surveillance capitalism and the forces trying to use technology to subvert our democracy.ldquoFew iniduals have shown contempt for our parliamentary democracy in the way Mark Zuckerberg has. If one thing is uniting politicians of all colours during this dficult time for our country, it is our determination to bring him and his company into line.A Government spokesman said: ldquoThis week the Culture Secretary will travel to the United States to meet with tech giants including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple to discuss many of these issues.ldquoWe welcome this reportrsquos contribution towards our work to tackle the increasing threat of disinformation and to make the UK the safest place to be online. We will respond in due course.Elizabeth Denham, the Information Commissioner, said: ldquoWersquore pleased with the committeersquos support of our recommendation for a statutory code that will clary how personal data should be used during political campaigning.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business.

The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions. As part of this Lisa is a member of the RICS Registered Valuers Scheme.Lisa also provides rent review and lease renewal advice to landlords and tenants throughout Northern Ireland.Additionally, Lisa was involved in the  non-domestic rating revaluation providing advice to a wide range of clients and negotiating the valuations with Land  Property Services on the clients behalf at application and appeal stages. Following the  revaluation Osborne King saved clients in excess of £.m. Lisa is working on the upcoming  non-domestic revaluation on behalf of a iety of clients.“I am fortunate to be involved in a wide range of work, some of which involves regular reporting to key clients such as one of Northern Ireland’s largest car showroom operators and well-known supermarket, convenience store businesses and global coffee brand.”  For more information contact Osborne King on   , email property@osborneking or visit the website at www.osbornekingView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/harbour_1221.jpg","title":"belfast harbour sets new cargo record","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Belfast Harbour has handled more than  million tonnes of cargo for the first time in its history.
