Even so, it’ll be tough for a Sierra Leone side who have played only two games in the past six months (a draw with Ethiopia and defeat by Comoros) due to Fifa sanctions relating to crowd trouble and government interference. Look out for Kei Kamara up front, who is a goal short of the country’s goalscoring record, currently held by Mohamed Kallon.

The WHO’s European region comprises 53 countries and territories including several in Central Asia, and Kluge noted that 50 of them had confirmed cases of the Omicron variant. According to the WHO, 26 of those countries reported that over one percent of their populations were “catching Covid-19 each week,” as of January 10, and that the region had seen over seven million new virus cases reported in the first week of 2022 alone. Referencing data collected over the last few weeks, Kluge said the variant was confirmed to be more transmissible and “the mutations it has enable it to adhere to human cells more easily, and it can infect even those who have been previously infected or vaccinated.” However, Kluge also stressed that “approved vaccines do continue to provide good protection against severe disease and death, including for Omicron.”Read the full story here: On Sunday, the UK’s education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, called for the UK to show the rest of the world how to move from pandemic to endemic Covid. But that is “a way off”, WHO’s senior emergency officer for Europe, Catherine Smallwood, said at a news briefing today. She adding that endemicity requires a stable and predictable transmission. Bulgaria’s prime minister Kiril Petkov, President Rumen Radev and other officials have gone into quarantine after being in contact with the parliamentary speaker, who tested positive for Covid, AFP reports.  Bulgaria has the lowest vaccination rate in the European Union, with experts blaming low trust in the authorities and widespread conspiracy theories. “Prime Minister Kiril Petkov is self-isolating ... he continues to work remotely,” the government press service said. Radev’s office also said the president and members of his administration were isolating but added they were “all in good health.” Parliament speaker Nikola Minchev tested positive for Covid-19 after attending a five-hour meeting of the National Security Council hosted by Radev on Monday afternoon. The talks were attended by key ministers - including those of the interior, defence and finance - as well as lawmakers and security sector officials. Chief health inspector Angel Kunchev said all of them had gone into quarantine. The Omicron variant is fuelling a fresh surge in cases, with 5,219 patients in hospital on Tuesday and 570 in intensive care.Its impact would be deadliest where vaccination rates were lower such as central and eastern Europe, Kluge warned, saying he was “deeply concerned” that as the variant moves east, “we have yet to see its full impact in countries where levels of vaccination uptake are lower, and where we will see more severe disease in the unvaccinated”. In Denmark, he said, where Omicron cases had “exploded in recent weeks”, the Covid-19 hospitalisation rate for unvaccinated patients during Christmas week had been was six times higher than for those who were fully vaccinated.

My colleague Matthew Weaver will be along shortly to pick up to global Covid live blog. Goodbye for now.The ONS has reported 176,035 deaths since March 2020, a figure that differs significantly from the government’s official count – which exceeded 150,000 deaths over the weekend – which requires patients to have had a positive test within 28 days of their death. The ONS figures are considered to be more accurate. However, due to delays in death registration they are not as up-to-date as the government figures. A total of 3,891 people have died of Covid since the first case of the Omicron variant was discovered in the UK on 27 November. However, the average lag between infection and deaths is 16-18 days and can be up to eight weeks, according to the ONS, so the Omicron death toll may increase further in coming weeks.A WEF report puts climate or environment-related threats in the top five slots in its list of the 10 long-term risks but warned a “vaccine ide” was making collaboration to limit temperature increases more difficult. In its annual global risks survey, the WEF – which has postponed its annual meeting in Davos until the summer because of the rapid spread of the Omicron variant – said the mood among its members was downbeat. Porfirije, 60, “remains with very mild symptoms and … will be treated at home”, his office said in a statement. “His Holiness has … has been prescribed appropriate therapy,” it said. “He prays for doctors and medical staff and especially for everyone affected by the epidemic.” Last year, Porfirije also went into isolation after being in contact with an infected priest.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) previously said the isolation period was in effect the same in both countries. It said the recommended minimum of six full days in the UK was counted from the onset of symptoms, while in the US the five-day isolation began from the day of a positive test, which could be several days after the first symptoms. However, the UKHSA has updated its blogpost, which now states: “In the UK our advice is to self-isolate for at least six full days from the point at which you have symptoms or get a positive test, whichever is first.” It continued: “In the United States, the advice is to isolate for at least five full days from the same point.” The deal approved late on Monday would have students in class Wednesday and teachers back a day earlier. It still requires approval with a vote of the union’s roughly 25,000 members.  Issues on the table have been metrics to close schools amid outbreaks and expanded Covid testing, the Associated Press reported. Neither side immediately disclosed full details of the proposal on Monday evening, but leaders generally said the agreement included measures to close inidual schools and plans to boost district Covid testing. The district notified parents in the largely low-income black and Latino school district of about 350,000 students that classes would resume Wednesday. “We know this has been very difficult for students and families,” mayor Lori Lightfoot said at an evening news conference. “Some will ask who won and who lost. No one wins when our students are out of the place where they can learn the best and where they’re safest.” Fears over the Covid variant meant that, from late November, all travellers arriving in the UK were required to take a pre-departure lateral flow test and self-isolate until they received a negative result from a post-arrival PCR test. This led to many people scrapping their travel plans over the festive period, PA Media reported. The new rules were relaxed for fully vaccinated arrivals last week after travel firms said they were ineffective due to Omicron spreading widely within the UK. “I can understand the hurt that these reports, these allegations, will have caused, particularly for those who’ve lost loved ones,” junior health minister Edward Argar told Sky News on Tuesday following a new report of alleged rule breaking, adding it was right that Johnson had previously commissioned a civil servant to investigate similar allegations. “It wouldn’t be appropriate … for me to comment on those ongoing conversations or her ongoing investigation. We’ve got to give a space to conclude that investigation.”Screening programmes for these less survivable cancers do not exist and many people are unaware of the symptoms. LSCT chairwoman Anna Jewell said:  India reported 168,063 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, a 20-fold rise in a month despite testing being well below capacity. However, most infected people have recovered at home and the level of hospitalisations has been less than half of that seen during the last major wave of infections in April and May. Many states have announced night curfews while the capital Delhi has also imposed a weekend lockdown, closed private offices as well as restaurants and bars in a bid to rein in the fast-spreading Omicron variant. But tens of thousands of pilgrims have already reached the site of the annual Ganges ritual on an island in the eastern state of West Bengal, which is reporting the most number of cases in the country after Maharashtra state in the west. “The crowd may swell to anywhere between 800,000 to one million. We are trying to implement all Covid protocols,” Bankim Chandra Hazra, a West Bengal minister in charge of organising the festival known as the Gangasagar Mela, told Reuters. We begin with news that people living in the England who test positive for Covid on a lateral flow device but do not develop symptoms will no longer need to take a PCR test to confirm their result while they self-isolate. The new approach has now come into force after it was announced last week by the UK Health Security Agency, Sky News reported. Most people who receive positive lateral flow results can now be confident they have Covid, with infection rates high across the country, according to health chiefs.

Photograph: iStockA year ago you surely imagined, and hoped, that life would be very different now from how it was for us then. And yet as we embark on both a new term and a new calendar year we face some old familiar questions.According to John F Kennedy, “Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other.” It would seem that your journey as a leader during Covid is far from over. As we step into 2022 we are also at a point in the academic year which offers you an opportunity to reflect on what you have learned.We hear about school leaders being under pressure, but what do any of us do about it? Hopelessly little, quite frankly, because we all feel under pressure too.When last term drew to a close there was more talk of imminent lockdown than there was of plans for Christmas. During one breaktime in the staffroom, strong yet uninformed certainties were shared about how important it was to bring lots of school materials home for the break, ready for the inevitable online learning in January. And yet during this discussion I watched a school team leave to play an away match fixture. How many households mix every time that happens?Even when everybody knows that nobody knows what is truly happening, you as school leaders must nonetheless lead whole school communities. How you handle this is the ultimate test of the quality of your leadership. When it is the normal, run-of-the-mill stuff which typically happens in education settings there will always be someone to tell you how it should best be done.When all one has are guidelines and recommendations there is greater autonomy – which is usually a good thing. You are also not immune to the peer pressure attached to what you may be allowing in your school, compared to what neighbouring schools are permitting. When nobody knows precisely what the right thing to do is, iniduals must draw on their own leadership skillset and choose their own best course of action. If your definition of leadership is limited to telling people what to do, you perhaps also expect to be told what to do – a “you tell me and I’ll tell them” approach.Right now we have a serious substitution crisis in schools, and yet extra-curricular and other outings are taking place. Young people need these outlets and if regulations permit, why shouldn’t they avail of them?And yet for the remaining school personnel to be under additional and avoidable strain is anything but helpful for students. If Covid regulations allow students from different schools to meet for a match, it takes serious courage for a school leader to insist fixtures only take place when there is sufficient personnel to cover classes. And what constitutes sufficient personnel? Where one school may permit merging of smaller class groups, another may be rigidly opposed to anything which deviates from the usual, more predictable patterns of contact.The consequences of loose leadership are greater now that we are back in a state of urgency due to the Omicron variant. The relative freedoms we have been granted may come at a serious price. But to withdraw them involves the risk of paying heavily in other ways.As school leaders you are under pressure from those who want rigid care around Covid. But you are also under pressure from those who want the maximum possible levels of normality. So much here is a case of only being able to please some of the people some of the time.Having established that nobody really knows what to do, I can hardly try to tell you what to do. Instead I’ll offer areas worth exploring and reflecting on in the context of your learning about yourself as a leader. Whatever role you play in the context of your work, you bring that same self everywhere else with you too. Those closest to you as you move into your personal roles witness the ways in which your professional role affects you, both positively and negatively. The longer this period of your school leadership journey lasts, the more critical it is that you do not lose sight of who you are beyond that professional role. For you to remain strong enough to lead us effectively throughout 2022, we have an active part to play too. We are all in this together, aren’t we?And so we must demonstrate empathy. For too many people the most senior roles are first defined by the healthy pay scales which accompany them. There is a perception that this salary must be earned, and that it is best earned through suffering. As key stakeholders, it is for staff, students and parents to get the best “value for money” by ensuring that you are at the top of your game and delivering optimally for the school community. And so we can acknowledge your efforts, perhaps even dare to praise them. After all, we look to you to praise our inidual and team efforts, so why shouldn’t we occasionally send some praise your way?Self-awareness is often touted as an essential leadership skill. It is one that those you lead must also be prepared to demonstrate. We cannot talk one talk but walk a different walk. Not these days. Too much is uncertain for you, and to make the best decisions for your own specific school context you need clarity from us. To have limited certainties from above is one thing, but to have mixed messages from us as well quite another.As stakeholders we could do worse than to unite in a joint new year’s resolution to commit to supporting school leadership teams more fully as you continue to steer us through these choppy waters.Happy new year and thank you for all that you do."},{"url":null,"title":"leaving cert cannot go ahead as planned this year students union says","story":"‘We are calling on the Minister of Education to take students’ voices into account and revise the decision about State exams for 2022.’ Photograph: iStockThe State exams cannot go ahead as planned this year due to Covid-related disruption, the Irish Second-Level Students’ Union (ISSU) has said.Under current plans, students sitting the 2022 State exams would see adjustments and more choice on their exam papers to account for the pandemic impact on education over the past two years.There will also be two sets of Leaving Cert exams held during the summer to cater for those who are sick with Covid-19 or are in isolation.However, the union representing second-level students has called the decision to proceed with traditional exams a “complete disregard for students’ best interests”.Emer Neville, ISSU president, said this year’s cohort of exam students has been “very vocal about the disruption they are facing in and out of the classroom”.“There is no online tuition provided to those isolating, and students have missed class time throughout 2021 and 2020 as a result of school closures,” she said.“There is no way we can stand over assessing these students with the traditional Leaving Certificate. We are calling on the Minister of Education to take students’ voices into account and revise the decision about State exams for 2022.”Jack McGinn, ISSU education officer, acknowledged concerns that some students in this Leaving Cert cohort have not completed a Junior Cert, as junior-cycle data has been used for standardisation of predicted grades over the past two years.“However,” he said, “in light of the circumstances, we must put students first as it is their future that will be impacted.”The union is surveying students on the matter, with provisional results showing a clear favour towards a hybrid model, which is a choice between predicted grades or sitting the exams.The statement is a significant development on a building issue, with Labour and Sinn Féin having already called for the reintroduction of the hybrid model.Paul Crone, director of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, said there needs to be something additional to this year’s exams to account for the Covid disruption.“We don’t know exactly what that should look like, or what’s possible, but what we’re saying is we should put students first,” he said.‘Intensely unfair’Deputy president of NUI Galway Prof Pól Ó Dochartaigh has said, however, that the hybrid Leaving Cert system created inequalities and he was in favour of students sitting traditional exams this year.While he understood the pressures facing Leaving Cert students and sympathised with them, he said accredited grades had resulted in inflation, which pushed up points for courses.Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland, Prof Ó Dochartaigh said that six times as many students had achieved 600 points last year than in the previous two years, which had led to a lottery for the final places in university.It was “intensely unfair” if some students received the results by putting themselves through the challenge of sitting the exam, but lost out because someone else’s teacher said they were very good, he added.“I think what is deeply problematic is the idea that one student gets the same number of points as another student on the basis of two very different methodologies.”An attempt should be made now to return to some sort of pre-2020 normality and the years 2020 and 2021 should be regarded as exceptional years because the alternative to that was to tell those who did the Leaving Cert prior to the pandemic that they would be permanently disadvantaged, Prof Ó Dochartaigh said.He added that he was not opposed to reform of the Leaving Cert system, but that reform should be on the basis that the experience was the same for everyone.\u0026nbsp‘No justification’The Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) and the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland (ASTI) have both said they will only support the traditional, externally-assessed exams.On Monday, TUI said there was “no justification” to offer students additional options as schools have remained open throughout this academic year.The ASTI, meanwhile, said speculation on the use of previous one-off grading processes during the pandemic is “unhelpful”.The Department of Education said it is “ aware of the disruption” experienced by students who are due to take their Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022.“These are challenging times for all of society and it is acknowledged that the impact of the Omicron virus means that some students and teachers cannot currently attend school,” a spokesman added.However, the Department said the adjustments to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 Leaving Cert – including increased choice – were designed to take account of the disruption to learning last year, “as well as providing for some possible further disruption in 202122”.“The Department will continue to engage with all partners in education on all matters relating to Leaving Certificate 2022,” it added."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: The small tortoiseshell can become confused by central heatingStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"immunology professor calls for long term covid plan against waning immunity","story":"Professor warns that immunity could wane in time and there is a  need for a long-term plan. Photograph: iStockThere needs to be a long-term plan for coping with Covid-19 in case the current level of immunity wanes, a leading professor of immunology has said.Record-breaking daily case counts have been recorded multiple times over the past few weeks as a result of the highly-transmissible Omicron variant.The number of Covid patients in hospital topped 1,000 this week – the first time since February 2021 – but the number in ICU has remained relatively stable.Prof Paul Moynagh, of Maynooth University said the high level of virus within the community, combined with the public health measures, have resulted in a “wall of immunity”.The high numbers of people who had already been infected, the success of the vaccination programme and the subsequent booster programme would protect against new infections, he said.However, speaking on Newstalk Breakfast, he warned that this could wane in time which was why there was a need for a long-term plan.While officially half a million cases had been identified in the past eight weeks, and one million cases was reached this week, in reality the figure was more likely to be 1.5 million, added Prof Moynagh.The virus was now going to find it difficult to find new people to infect, he said.The success of the vaccine campaign was the reason why ICU numbers were steady, he added.MasksOn Tuesday, The  reported that the State’s public health team has raised the prospect of greater use of higher-grade respirator masks, advising the Government that they may better protect people at higher risk from Covid-19.The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) has advised that people can choose to wear FFP3 and the slightly lower-grade FFP2 respirator or medical masks instead of cloth masks if they wish, but stopped short of recommending the higher-grade masks to the public instead of cloth ones.Responding to this, Prof Moynagh said that he did not understand why approval for FFP2N5 masks had been withheld until now.“We’re coming to this very late,” he said, adding that all of the evidence showed that the higher grade masks performed very well and were better than cloth masks.Health workersSeparately, it is expected that the Cabinet is likely to consider easing the requirement for healthcare workers who are close contacts of Covid-19 cases to isolate in order to ease pressure on staff numbers.Some 15,000 HSE staff are currently off duty for Covid-related reasons, HSE chief executive Paul Reid said at the weekend.New advice from the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) for countries which are experiencing extreme stress on their healthcare systems was issued over the weekend.It is understood that Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan and senior Nphet figures are considering the ECDC advice, which may go to ministers on Wednesday.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"mandatory vaccination not going to happen in the republic","story":"‘Officials are already concerned about the short duration of protection provided by booster shots against Omicron, which could be as low as five weeks.’ File photograph: GettyMandatory Covid-19 vaccination is the issue that refuses to go away.It remains under consideration by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet), according to minutes of its meeting in mid-December.

Photograph: Andrew DownesPA Wire What did we learn from Day One of the Great Golfgate Trial?We found out that lawyers – if the legal heavyweights who turned up in force for a district court case in Galway are anything to go by – have a rather sniffy attitude to golf. Not quite their cup of tee.And that the Oireachtas Golf Society was a hitherto unrecognised major force in Irish political history until it hit the headlines last year due to the “Golfgate” furore.We learned that the size of a gap in a partition is a moveable feast. It certainly was moveable at the particular feast under the spotlight in Judge Mary Fahy’s courtroom on Thursday.We discovered that the annual President’s Prize dinner was not a “frivolous” event in 2020 and that the traditional presentation at the 19th hole after a convivial day on the links was anything but “a frolic”.That this event was, in fact, “poignant”. This is because it was held in honour of a politician who was behind the much-underestimated Golfing Revival Era in Irish politics 50 years ago. The late Mark Killilea was a driving force in the resurrection of the Oireachtas Golf Society, which had fizzled out after it was founded by a TD called Major Somethingorother in 1929.We heard that the then captain of the guard in Leinster House, an enthusiastic member of the society, had two breakfasts and one evening meal in the hotel which is now at the centre of this court case. And that a member of the Seanad and his wife left the dinner before the formalities commenced because “we’re not dessert people”.And that guidelines issued with the “imprimatur of the State” and bearing the harp of Rialtas na hÉireann on printed communications may, or may not be, worthless.We also learned on the opening day of the trial of politicians Noel Grealish and Donie Cassidy and hotel bosses John and James Sweeney for allegedly contravening the Covid emergency health act by holding a dinner indoors for over 50 people, that all of the witnesses called by the prosecution had nothing but praise for how the defendants managed the event.Bending the rulesThe story of the Oireachtas Golf Society’s now-infamous dinner hit the headlines late in 2020. In the early days of the pandemic, claims that politicians had been bending the strict rules painfully and dutifully observed by wider society caused uproar. But the lawyers acting for Grealish and Cassidy set out from the start to show how their clients acted with the utmost propriety at all times and their actions have been gravely misunderstood by the public.Which brings us back to something else learned on Thursday: when push comes to shove, it’s all the media’s fault. In this case, according to Donie Cassidy’s lawyer Colm Smyth SC, for getting involved and then “public hysteria was whipped up and hysteria was whipped up”.This, he said, led to “a lot of very good people” having “to resign from their positions”.Near the end of the first day, Martin Brett, a Fine Gael councillor from Kilkenny who was at the golf outing and dinner in Connemara, said he didn’t even know how many people were at the function until he read it in the paper.“Don’t believe what you read in the newspapers and the journal,” said Eoghan Cole BL, for the State.Barrister Cole was up against it. A lone ranger on the DPP’s side against the heavy guns hired by the defendants. The place was coming down with junior and senior counsel and instructing solicitors.Smyth, for Donie Cassidy, made the most running on day one, with bracing interventions from Senator Michael McDowell SC (for former PD colleague and now independent TD Noel Grealish) and the country’s leading libation lawyers Constance Cassidy and Eddie Walsh (for James and John Sweeney, respectively).Bewildering meanderThere isn’t much you can tell those two about the licensing laws. When Constance, in the midst of a bewildering meander through statutory instruments and hospitality regulations, talked about “the consumption of intoxicating liquor”, you knew it wasn’t the first time she said those words.Among the ranks of the BLs was junior counsel Willie Penrose, the former Labour TD. He is part of the Cassidy squad.As for the journalists sent to cover this trial of the half-century (50 years a-fourballing, and all that), there was no room in the court building for them. Two were allowed inside to hear the proceedings, the rest given a video link to download and hope for the best.Enter the hero of the hour: Fergal McGrath, brother of former TD Finian, who runs the Town Hall Theatre opposite the courthouse. Fergal made a room available to the hacks (which is more than the Courts Service could manage, despite this being a case of national interest which was flagged months ago).Business for Fergal has been hugely impacted by Covid, but he has a tasty line-up of events coming in the new year. The panto, sadly, had to be cancelled so all the kiddies in Galway missed out on the fairy godmother saying: “You shall go to the (golf) ball!”After a morning spent mostly in legal discussion, Colm Smyth got round to telling us of Donie Cassidy. A man who has never been before the courts in his life, has had a distinguished political career and is the owner of four hotels in Dublin, and that’s just for starters. “A lawmaker, not a lawbreaker.”Donie, in Colm’s words, sounded like Santa. Before the event, “he checked the regulations. He checked the guidelines. He consulted with people.” Probably to make sure nobody would be naughty and everyone would be nice.Former TD and senator Cassidy was president of the society. His co-defendant, TD Noel Grealish, was captain on the night.No hand, act or putterMichael McDowell said this was very important because his client’s position is that president Cassidy organised the do as it was his dinner. Noel Grealish, as captain, had some involvement in organising the first day of golf but “I just want to be 100 per cent clear” he had no hand, act or putter in organising the shindig on the second night.Eddie and Constance, meanwhile, said that the “company” as opposed to the two Mr Sweeneys should have been charged.Then Colm Smyth started talking about “potentially an unsavoury aspect” to the prosecution, without explaining entirely what he meant.“Substantiate the unsavouryness,” challenged Eoghan Cole, for the State.The witnesses so far are all people who attended the golf dinner.They were blown away by the Covid prevention measures taken by management.The mainly retired minor politicians who attended this dinner were “exceptionally impressed”. But then, they don’t get out as much as they used to. There would be no “intermingling” at this hooley in Connemara.One of the guests recalled the rigid attention to the pandemic prevention rules on the night.“A waiter said to me: table service only. You don’t move unless you go to the toilet.”One of the lawyers pointed approvingly to “the liberality of sanitisers and so on”.There was some discussion as to whether they were separated by a “partition” or “a solid wall” but there was a definite ision until the gap appeared at prize-giving.It was seven to eight feet on either side of a pillar, according to one witness, and “probably the width of a person”, according to another.But did two separate rooms of people attending the dinner constitute a single event or multiple events? It’s a bit like St Patrick and the shamrock – three leaves on the one stem. St Donie and the dinner – two rooms on the one feed.Judge Fahy will have to decide.She admitted she isn’t much into golf, with the course in Ballyconneely more “the Dublin fours”. Michael McDowell and Eddie Cassidy were similarly unmoved by the joys of the game.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"remote learning should have returned after christmas principal","story":"Paul Walsh, who took over as the principal of St Joseph’s College in Garbally, Ballinasloe, Co Galway, last AugustPaul Walsh, who took over as the principal of St Joseph’s College in Garbally, Ballinasloe, Co Galway, in\u0026nbspAugust 2020, believes that remote learning should have been brought back in operation once schools reopened after Christmas.“I’d say possibly a quarter to a third of our students are at home anyway and they’re not being taught,” he said. “I think we would be better if we moved to remote teaching and learning for a couple of weeks.”The Emergency Substitution Scheme brought in last November, whereby teachers are now allowed to work more than 22 hours, has also been “a huge help”, the principal said.Every habit and tradition in the school has changed because of Covid-19, with parent-teacher meetings replaced by well-organised evening calls. “It worked well last year. Some say it’s the way forward,” he added.Covid officerGarbally College uses carbon-dioxide monitors and has hepa air filters – including\u0026nbsptwo in special-needs classes and the other in the staffroom, because “they have the biggest congestion of people”, said Joan Madden, the school’s Covid officer since the beginning of the pandemic.Ms Madden has taken charge of ensuring that classrooms are ready and supplied with PPE, masks, sanitisers and the dispensers.Initially, stock had to be bought from a list of suppliers set by the Department of Education, which left Madden finding it “tough” to cover the school’s needs because the listed suppliers could not supply stock.“The Department of Education saw sense after a while and allowed us to buy from a local supplier. We began ordering from a local man, Tom Monaghan, in Craughwell, Co Galway, and Ocean Hygiene.“If I rang him on a Tuesday, ‘Tom, I need 1,000 masks’, I’d have them on Friday. So yes, in the beginning, it was torture.

Photograph: iStockThe Government is likely to accept a recommendation from an independent body to shorten the working week of many public servants.Under the recommendations, additional hours for some public servants accepted in lieu of pay cuts during the economic crash – under the Haddington Road agreement – will be discontinued.However, the cost of the concession will be significantly less than the €600 million-plus the Department of Public Expenditure had warned about last year. Instead, the Government estimates that accepting the recommendations will cost about €180 million this year and €360 million in a full year.The 2013 deal increased the working week to 37 hours for those who had been working 35 hours or less up to that point. Those working more than 35 hours faced an increase of up to 39 hours.Although pay cuts introduced in the austerity era were temporary, and have since been reversed, it had been the general position of governments that parallel work practice reforms would remain in place, including additional unpaid working hours.However, on Monday it emerged that the Independent Body Examining Additional Working Hours, chaired by Kieran Mulvey, had sent recommendations to restore working hours for civil and public servants to Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath. The process was part of the most recent public sector pay agreement, the Building Momentum deal.It is understood Mr Mulvey has recommended some exceptions, including for hospital consultants, who are currently engaged in contract negotiations, and for academics. It is also expected to set a minimum working week for public servants of 35 hours a week.Health concernsThere is also some concern in government about the effect of the changes on the health service, “which would need to be carefully considered before being implemented”, according to one source.The report is unlikely to be considered by the Government for some weeks.Unions welcomed the news, which they said would finally unwind the last of the austerity measures.Noting that temporary pay cuts for more senior public servants had already been restored, Kevin Callinan, general secretary of the trade union Fórsa, said such a move on working hours would remove “a longstanding and debilitating drain on morale and productivity”.“The acceptance of the recommendation by government would also significantly enhance the prospect for continued stability in public service delivery and quality, not least by removing a huge obstacle to the successful negotiation of a public service agreement to replace Building Momentum when it expires later this year,” he said.The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation also welcomed the move, saying it would help with the retention of nurses and midwives.“The additional hours have disproportionately impacted our largely female workforce,” said general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha, who said the measure had pushed many nurses and midwives into part-time work.“Since 2013 the additional unpaid hours have had a considerable negative impact on morale, and the retention of nurses and midwives within the public health service.”"},{"url":null,"title":"zappone s special envoy role added status to ireland s un bid","story":"The analysis formed part of a review of special envoy roles that followed the controversy over the ill-fated bid to appoint Katherine Zappone to a subsequent special envoy role on freedom of expression last year. Photograph: Nick BradshawKatherine Zappone’s role as a special envoy for Ireland’s bid for a United Nations Security Council seat added “status” to the campaign which came to fruition in 2020, according to a value for money assessment of such positions.The analysis formed part of a review of special envoy roles that followed the controversy over the ill-fated bid to appoint former Independent minister Ms Zappone to a subsequent special envoy role on freedom of expression last year.There had been no open competition and the Government was forced to deny Opposition claims of cronyism.She ultimately declined the job amid the political row over her appointment.The subsequent review of special envoys found that the diplomatic jobs should be appointed in an “open, accountable and transparent manner”.The analysis of the costs of special envoys was carried out by consultancy organisation Sia Partners, whose managing partner Jane Williams was part of the review team along with senior Department of Foreign Affairs officials.A document entitled “Assessment of value for money – background notes” was released under Freedom of Information laws.It says: “In the time available a detailed cost-benefit or value for money assessment could not be carried out.”‘Outcomes and impacts’The assessment “looked at the available information on the outcomes and impacts achieved and compared these to the additional costs incurred to carry out the special envoy roles”.The document says: “It is difficult then to disaggregate the incremental impact of special envoys from the work of Irish diplomacy, save to rely on the outcome of specific goals, eg winning the Security Council seat.”It says Ireland was successful “against strong competition” in securing the votes for its appointment to the Security Council in June 2020.Twelve special envoys including then minister for children Ms Zappone and serving and retired diplomats worked on the campaign and their costs came to just over €292,000.The document says: “The special envoy role of the appointed government minister added status to this campaign.”It adds: “The qualitative evidence suggests that Ireland’s special envoys contributed to the outcome.”Other documents released show that €12,152 was spent on travel-related costs for Ms Zappone.Five retired diplomats who worked on the campaign got ex-gratia payments of €10,000 each while one - former Department of Foreign Affairs secretary general and ambassador David Cooney waived the payment. Neither the serving diplomats nor Ms Zappone got extra payments.‘Initiative spending’The value for money assessment also found that the four special envoy missions in existence during the period examined cost a combined total of just under €350,000 – or an average of €87,500 each – and that this “appears modest, in the scale of Government programme or initiative spending”.The role of former Fine Gael TD John Deasy as a special envoy to the United States Congress on the Undocumented Irish cost €55,407 in travel-related costs.The assessment looked at spending on envoy roles up to September 2021.At that point there was combined spending of just €1,205 for two of the roles: Kenneth Thompson’s appointment as special envoy to Francophone Africa and Tom Arnold as special envoy on food systems.Travel related to their work was curtailed by the Covid-19 pandemic during much of 2021, though both were able to go abroad, Mr Thompson travelling to Gabon, Burkina Faso and Niger and Mr Arnold going to Brussels.Both participated in numerous virtual meetings during 2021 and plan to undertake travel in 2022, though this will be contingent on the state of Covid-19 restrictions.Mr Arnold is to be paid a €5,000 honorarium for 2021 shortly, while Mr Thompson will be paid €25,000 for last year. Their roles are both due to expire at in December this year."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"African country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"must listen south african scientists omicron","story":"‘There are several things we don’t know about omicron,” a sombre Professor Sir Chris Whitty told the nation in the week before Christmas, “but all the things we do know are bad.”His comment puzzled many people at the time, given that scientists in South Africa, where omicron was first identified, had reported that it appeared to be less severe than the then-dominant delta variant of Covid. Surely that was good news?Three weeks on, Sir Chris’s determination to dismiss the encouraging data coming from South Africa seems even more baffling. Instead of the post-Christmas lockdown that came to be regarded almost as an inevitability, Covid rules are now being eased. The NHS did not collapse, and the number of patients requiring ventilation remains less than a quarter of the peak a year ago.Legitimate questions are now being asked about why Britain was so dismissive of the evidence from South Africa, and whether Government scientific advisers are once again using fear as a method of control.One of those who is doing the asking is Angelique Coetzee, chairman of the South African Medical Association and the first doctor to raise the alarm over a possible new variant, which turned out to be omicron.Dr Coetzee was among those who reported that omicron caused “very, very mild” symptoms compared with delta, and she hypothesised that it “could potentially be of great help to us” by replacing the more dangerous delta variant and helping the population to reach herd immunity at minimal cost to life. She says she was “astonished” at the panicked response to it in the UK.“I don’t understand why it’s happening,” she told the  from her home in Pretoria. “It doesn’t make any sense to me. The fear that has been spread in Britain – why is that being done?“South Africa has a younger population, but we should have seen far more disease than you because of the vaccination picture. We only have 44 per cent of people double-jabbed, and we only started the boosters last week.”In the UK, 83 per cent of people are double-jabbed, and 61 per cent have had a booster.“If you don’t know by now that the majority of people are going to have mild symptoms, then what other evidence are you waiting for?”It is not the first time Government scientific advisers have allegedly been dismissive of what colleagues in foreign countries have been saying.On February 21, 2020, the Italian village of Vo’ Euganeo, near Venice, went into strict quarantine after the country’s first recorded death from Covid, and almost all of its residents were tested. Around 40 per cent of those who tested positive had no symptoms, strongly suggesting asymptomatic transmission was occurring.Some members of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) say they raised concerns about asymptomatic transmission with Sir Patrick Vallance, Chief Scientific Adviser, and with modeller Prof Neil Ferguson, only for their concerns to be dismissed.The two men say the warnings were not ignored, yet Boris Johnson has always insisted he would have done things differently if he had understood sooner that Covid was transmitted asymptomatically (Britain resisted lockdowns for a further month after the Italian data was published).South Africa has a highly sophisticated genomic surveillance capability for Covid – which is why both the omicron and beta variants were first identified there – so the thoughts of its scientific experts surely merit attention.Yet Boris Johnson said last month that “the idea that this is somehow a milder version of the virus, I think that’s something we need to set on one side”, while Sir Chris said evidence from South Africa of a milder illness had been “overinterpreted”.Does Dr Coetzee think xenophobia has played a role in Britain’s dismissal of her advice? “No – but I think there was arrogance from the politicians in the UK. Also, Boris Johnson was going through a bad time because of the criticism of his Christmas parties, so maybe there was a political reason for all this.“People in the UK, including the ones advising the Government, don’t seem to understand what the clinical picture is. The scientists are not sitting with patients in front of them. I am a GP and I’m looking at a list of 116 patients I saw, of whom only three were admitted to hospital, one of whom was not fully vaccinated and two of whom were high risk because of obesity, diabetes and so on.“You have to empower people by telling them what is going on, but I get the feeling that some of the UK scientists didn’t want to use the word ‘mild’, they only want to use the word ‘severe’.”Her suspicion appears to be borne out by the language used by the SPI-M-O modelling committee, which on December 7 said: “Currently, there is no strong evidence that omicron infections are either more or less severe than delta infections.”Laura Dodsworth, author of the book A State of Fear: How the UK Government Weaponised Fear During the Covid-19 Pandemic, says the “linguistic manipulation” was entirely deliberate.“The omission of the word ‘mild’ is not an accident,” she says. “The problem for the Government is that once you have started using fear as a tactic, there is nowhere left to go, so you have to keep on using it, and you have to keep on quoting worst case scenarios.“But each time you do it, the tactics become less successful because people become wise to it. Once you have seen the smoke and mirrors, you can’t unsee it.”Modelling published by SPI-M-O on December 15 suggested a “high-level scenario” of infections, peaking at between 600,000 and 2 million per day with the current Plan B restrictions between late December and January, with up to 6,000 deaths per day, peaking between mid-January and mid-March.In fact, infections are currently averaging around 180,000 per day and may have already peaked in some parts of the country, with deaths averaging just over 150 per day.Mark Harper MP, chairman of the anti-lockdown Covid Recovery Group, said ministers had once again been guilty of blithely following expert advice rather than interrogating advisers and looking at the picture in the round.“The whole history of the pandemic shows that ministers need to ask better questions,” he says, “challenge the advice and really get their heads around what they are being told so they can weigh it up against all the other factors they need to consider in the best interests of the country.”The most gloomy predictions for the omicron wave now seem certain to have been wide of the mark. The problem for the Government is that if a more dangerous, vaccine-resistant variant arises, it could prove difficult to persuade an increasingly cynical public to do as they’re told.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Martin Reynolds will stay in his role and has \u0026#39full confidence\u0026#39 of Boris Johnson after Downing Street party emailCovid latest news: School leaders back five-day isolation as classes of 120 children cram into halls amid teacher shortageHow are my local hospitals coping with Covid?

It is even more unusual to see a two-year period with mortality so far above the preceding five-year average. We have to go back eighty years to 1940-41 to find such an extreme period on this measure.”Although The Great Depression saw a rise in mortality of about 10 per cent in 1929, rates had dropped back by 1930, with the average of the two years only being two per cent above the prior five-year average.The figures are estimates and the final data will be crunched when the Office for National Statistics (ONS) releases final figures on Tuesday.Overall, deaths in 2021 were just one per cent higher than the 10-year average, but experts said that a drop in mortality would be expected over time, so even a small rise was worrying.Figures show that before 2020, no year has had higher mortality rates than the 10-year average since 1963.In 2021, more deaths were registered in England and Wales than in any year since the Eighties, apart from 2020.There are likely to be between 585,000 and 590,000 deaths registered in England and Wales in 2021. In contrast, 2020 was the first year since 1918 to see more than 600,000 deaths.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Martin Reynolds will stay in his role and has \u0026#39full confidence\u0026#39 of Boris Johnson after Downing Street party emailCovid latest news: School leaders back five-day isolation as classes of 120 children cram into halls amid teacher shortageHow are my local hospitals coping with Covid?

They went extinct 90 million years ago.The animal was characterised by its large teeth and eyes, and ranged in size from one to more than 25 metres. It was first identified in the 19th century by the palaeontologist Mary Anning.Dr Dean Lomax, a palaeontologist who has studied the species, said: “Despite the many ichthyosaur fossils found in Britain, it is remarkable to think that the Rutland ichthyosaur is the largest skeleton ever found in the UK. It is a truly unprecedented discovery and one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history.“Not only is it the largest ichthyosaur skeleton ever found in Britain, but it is also the most complete skeleton of a large prehistoric reptile ever discovered in the UK. And yes, that includes dinosaurs.”When they first spotted the remains poking out of some clay, team members at Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust were unsure about their origins and suggested that they could simply be pipes. After speaking to Rutland council, experts from the University of Leicester were called and the ichthyosaur skeleton was identified.The remains were dug out by a team of expert palaeontologists from around the UK in August and September. They worked in partnership with Anglian Water, Rutland County Council and the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust. The skeleton was also surrounded by the remains of ammonites and belemnites, which may have been feasting on the animal\u0027s remains. Scientists said that the discovery could give them a better understanding of their ecosystems.Although two incomplete and much smaller ichthyosaurs were found during the initial construction of Rutland Water in the 1970s, experts said that it was unusual to find a specimen of this kind in the Midlands. Remains are usually found across the Jurassic and Yorkshire coast.“To put this find into context for the public in the world of British palaeontology, the discovery is like finding a complete Tyrannosaurus rex out in the Badlands of America, only this Jurassic giant was found in a nature reserve in Rutland, of all places. It is a truly unprecedented discovery and one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history,” Dr Lomax said.Scientists are now securing funding to clean and repair the skeleton before it is put on display.Dr Mark Evans of the British Antarctic Survey said: “I’ve been studying the Jurassic fossil reptiles of Rutland and Leicestershire for over 20 years. When I first saw the initial exposure of the specimen with Joe Davis I could tell that it was the largest ichthyosaur known from either county. However, it was only after our exploratory dig that we realised that it was practically complete to the tip of the tail.”He added: “It’s a highly significant discovery both nationally and internationally but also of huge importance to the people of Rutland and the surrounding area.”Nigel Larkin, a specialist palaeontological conservator, said: “It’s not often you are responsible for safely lifting a very important but very fragile fossil weighing that much.“It is a responsibility, but I love a challenge. It was a very complex operation to uncover, record, and collect this important specimen safely.”The excavation of the remains will feature on BBC Two’s Digging For Britain on Tuesday at 8pm.More from NewsCovid latest news: School leaders back five-day isolation as classes of 120 children cram into halls amid teacher shortagePolitics latest news: Martin Reynolds will stay in his role and has \u0026#39full confidence\u0026#39 of Boris Johnson after Downing Street party emailHow are my local hospitals coping with Covid?

For although the surface area of Britain is modest, our geology is erse. The opportunities to find fossils from a range of different time periods are great.Good places to look are around the rocks of Surrey, Sussex and the Isle of Wight, which date from the early Cretaceous period and were deposited 120 to 140 million years ago by rivers and on flood plains. If it weren’t for the fact these areas are covered in houses and trees – and if our climate were somewhat warmer and drier – we’d no doubt be finding as many dinosaurs here as they do in the arid American state of Utah.Yet despite our damp climate and developed land, we live in a golden age of palaeontological discovery – and also of interest in prehistory, which, of course, is linked. The UK has a long historical association with fossil-hunting and palaeontology. The first dinosaur fossils that were recognised as such were found in this country: a collection of big teeth spotted in rocks by the side of a road in Sussex in 1822 by Mary Ann Mantell and her husband, Gideon. It was Richard Owen, a British scientist, who later coined the term “dinosauria”, meaning “terrible lizards”. The teeth were the first evidence of a dinosaur known as Iguanodon.There followed a 19th-century fossil-hunting craze in Britain among Victorian gentlemen naturalists. Its legacy is found in the Natural History Museum, where we have today a large dinosaur collection from countries including Canada and from southern Africa.Until the start of the Second World War, dinosaurs fascinated the British. Our interest seems to have waned after that, until the mid-1990s, when our interest in these primal and often terrifying beasts was reignited. I was 13 when Steven Spielberg’s blockbuster Jurassic Park was released in 1993. Although I knew I wanted to work with dinosaurs, my interest in the subject would have been regarded as niche for a girl in her early teens. The film made it more socially acceptable and mainstream. It made me less weird among my secondary school peers.Now that the Jurassic Park generation has come of age, we are seeing the results of those childhood passions in our universities. During the 15 years that I have worked in the field, there has been an explosion in academic study of vertebrate palaeontology. Several universities now offer undergraduate degrees in the subject, including the universities of Portsmouth, Bristol and Birmingham. While geology courses more often used to cater to students interested in entering, say, the oil or mining industries, today’s geology undergraduates are more interested in bioersity.Yet as in the case of the Rutland sea dragon, whose remains were found by Joe Davis, an employee of the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust, many palaeontological finds are opportunistic – that is, not made by professionals. The UK today has a large community of amateur fossil-hunters, who are out there looking for fossils, sometimes on a daily basis. They visit the brick pits around Peterborough, or the cliffs of the Isle of Wight, particularly in winter when the storms roll in and the rocks become unstable and can collapse.There are no special techniques to fossil-finding. We just have to use an ancient tool: our eyes. But we have to know where to look.So what has this golden age of palaeontological discovery actually yielded? Quite a lot, really. Last year saw not only the unearthing of the Rutland sea dragon, but also a huge Jurassic seabed in a Cotswolds quarry, where colleagues have discovered a beautifully preserved haul of fossil sea urchins, starfish, sea lilies and feather stars.The remains of two dinosaurs that lived about 125 million years ago and were found on the Isle of Wight were identified in September and named Ceratosuchops inferodios – or “horned crocodile-faced hell heron” – and Riparovenator milnerae, a predator with a skull more than 3ft in length.Then in October, we identified Britain’s earliest known carnivorous dinosaur. Named Pendraig milnerae and roughly the size of a chicken, this creature had been found in Carmarthenshire in Wales in the 1950s and entered our collection in the 1960s. But it wasn’t until last year that, after comparison with better known specimens from around the world, we discovered it was new and deserved to be recognised as a type of dinosaur in its own right.In November, other fossils found on the Isle of Wight were identified as another new species, called Brighstoneus simmondsi. The defining characteristic of this eight-metre long herbivore was its bulbous nose.Behind the Isle of Wight finds was a retired GP called Jeremy Lockwood, who has spent much of the pandemic hunting for fossils on the beach and is studying part-time for a PhD at the University of Portsmouth and the Natural History Museum. He may not be the only one who has spent these past two years in fruitful palaeontological employ. With a boom in “staycations” – including on the Jurassic coast of southern England – it’s possible there has been something of a pandemic boom in dinosaur hunting. And, from our point of view, the more eyes on the ground the better. The more discoveries by amateurs this heightened interest turns up, the more detailed a picture we can build of our prehistory.So far we have barely scratched the surface. From the start of the Jurassic period to the end of the Cretaceous is a time of 140 million years. During this, everything that lived on land and was larger than a metre in size was a dinosaur. So that is 140 million years of animals evolving, dying and going extinct. Most of their remains will not have become fossils. Many of those that did are yet to be discovered, as vast portions of the world remain very little studied. In Africa, South America and parts of central Asia, prehistory is underexplored and there remain huge geographic areas where we don’t really know what was living there. Our existing knowledge only covers a fraction of a per cent of what once roamed our planet, and of what is still on it, sitting beneath the surface waiting to be found. With every new discovery, we feel a thrill of excitement – and, each time it happens, we learn a little more.Dr Susannah Maidment is a principal researcher in Earth Sciences at the Natural History Museum.

Rumours are flying that Jeremy Corbyn, still deprived of the Labour whip at Westminster and therefore unable to submit himself as an official candidate ahead of the next general election, is about to launch a new party.Naturally this is being seen as dreadful news for Corbyn’s successor as Labour leader, Keir Starmer: splits, which are far more common on the British Left than on the Right, tend to presage a significant electoral defeat for the party. See 1983 and 2019.There’s no escaping the fact that a new party emerging from Corbyn’s recently launched Peace and Justice Project would pose some organisational and presentational difficulties for Starmer. But there is far more to be gained from such a split, and those who want to see a Labour government in our lifetime should keep their fingers crossed that the rumour mill, on this occasion, is accurate.The root of Corbyn’s grievance is obvious: any MP deprived of the party whip cannot be considered by his or her local party as an official candidate. Naturally, Starmer wants rid of Corbyn from the Parliamentary Labour Party, but that simply wasn’t going to happen if he trusted the judgment of local members in Islington North. Pressing the nuclear button of expulsion would provoke a massive backlash, so deprivation of the whip until after the next general election is an effective, unchallengeable tactic that will serve Starmer’s ends.It\u0027s rumoured that the former Labour MP Mary Creagh, who famously confronted Corbyn for his performance as leader after she lost her Wakefield seat at the 2019 election, is now rumoured to be the leadership’s preferred candidate to replace Corbyn in Islington North – a move that is 100 per cent guaranteed to infuriate Corbyn’s supporters across the country.The hard Left, of which Corbyn remains the figurehead, have been itching for an opportunity to throw a punch at Starmer and the Labour Party and there are many who would relish the prospect of Corbyn standing as an independent against the official Labour candidate — a contest Corbyn would be likely to win.But even this scenario has more upsides than downsides for Starmer. He needs to show that he is in charge of the party and that his promise of a zero tolerance approach to anti-Semitism is being honoured. Corbyn, whose ill-judged comments about the inquiry into anti-Semitism in Labour by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) led directly to his suspension, remains an embarrassment to Labour so long as he sits in Parliament. If he is there as an independent with his own mandate, Starmer can legitimately disown all responsibility for his presence.And there are plenty in Labour who would welcome the setting up of an entirely new party committed to the kind of anti-West, hard Left economic policies that Corbyn has stood for throughout his career — some because they might be interested in signing up, but many more because they would finally be rid of shouty activists who seem to have more in common with the Socialist Workers’ Party than with a moderate Labour Party committed to change through the democratic and parliamentary process.Such a split should, by rights, have happened long before now there is precious little common ground between centrist Labour and Corbyn’s hard Left, other than a loathing of the common enemy. They disagree fundamentally on defence, on the economy and on foreign policy, especially with regard to Israel and the Middle East. A orce would allow each side to live more happily apart. The reason such a split has never happened is nothing to do with loyalty to the Labour brand or an affection for its history and legacy it is because the current electoral system is guaranteed to kill any splinter group, either immediately or within a very few years. It’s why so many on the hard Left are advocates of electoral reform, which they hope would guarantee at least some representation for a committed Marxist faction. Introducing the single transferable vote would, moreover, have the added attraction of relieving the main party of the need to reform its policies in order to win new voters. Post-polling day alliances could be formed — even between Labour and its former comrades — that would both veto any future Conservative government while allowing unreconstructed socialists to get into government.That’s the theory anyway. That any new Corbyn-led party might be launched before electoral reform is secured says a lot about how desperate the hard Left is. They have never been short of belief in their own philosophy and a conviction that the electorate would embrace them if only they weren’t so stupid and greedy. Like the SDP in 1981, perhaps they believe they can break the mould of British politics with a display of chutzpah and razzamatazz and a decent showing in the odd by-election.Until a split happens (and sadly, it may not), Starmer will continue to feel he is somehow in thrall to his own Left wing, convinced he must continue to throw the occasional morsel to those who once voted for Corbyn but who, perhaps reluctantly, supported his leadership bid in 2020. But imagine a world where a significant number of those party members threw their lot in with the People’s Movement for Peace, Justice and Kindness (trademark pending), where Starmer no longer had to put up with internal criticism every time he praised the record of the last Labour government or supported Sir Tony Blair’s knighthood. What new, innovative policies could Labour develop once it was free from the tyranny of having to sate the socialist appetite of those who can never be satisfied?Imagine having the freedom to campaign for a Labour government without having to worry about those who believe that any Labour Party that is popular with the British people is, by definition, a Labour Party that has sold out.Starmer and his team should adopt a poker faced approach to the prospect of a Corbyn split. In public they should say all the right things — regret, what a shame, best of luck, etc — and confine their glee to private occasions. The new party that would be born from Corbyn’s defection would not be his own it would be the Labour Party.More from NewsCovid latest news: School leaders back five-day isolation as classes of 120 children cram into halls amid teacher shortagePolitics latest news: Martin Reynolds will stay in his role and has \u0026#39full confidence\u0026#39 of Boris Johnson after Downing Street party emailHow are my local hospitals coping with Covid?

In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, interest rates were slashed from 5.25 per cent to 0.5 per cent and we have become addicted to cheap money policies ever since — impacting peoples’ attitude towards saving and borrowing. In particular, a generation of younger people have spent their entire adult lives with interest rates at rock bottom.Due to the imminent cost of living crisis, there is now a recognition that the Bank of England was asleep at the wheel last year and did not act early enough to curb inflationary pressures. Although it raised rates in December from 0.1 per cent to 0.25 per cent, they are still low. This poses a challenge to financial stability. Low rates mean financial markets do not price properly for risk, encouraging speculative behaviour. This last happened ahead of the global financial crisis. Equally, because of quantitative easing, the Bank of England is now the biggest holder of government debt, which has artificially inflated bond prices and kept longer-term borrowing yields low. We used to believe that such low yields would boost investment. Now they seem to encourage firms to load their balance sheets with debt.Perhaps the biggest concern, though, is that the culture of low rates has exacerbated inequality. They have fed rampant asset price inflation. This is not just of stocks and bonds, but also of house prices. While there are other factors at play, cheap finance has been a key driver. Even though mortgage rates are low, buyers have had to take on more borrowing, burdening themselves with debt. This has fed imbalances between home-owners and renters, between the asset rich and asset poor. Pensioners who rely on bank deposits have suffered, but it is the young who are impacted most.Younger people increasingly can’t move from Generation Rent to Generation Buy, which is part of a broader challenge they have in seeing themselves as being able to amass capital. Assets that should be attainable are too far away for too many. One might be tempted to say we are moving from a property-owning democracy to an always-borrowing democracy. Of course, higher wages are part of the challenge, not just low interest rates.Unfortunately, some may only have access to loan sharks or pay day loans — but even among the wider population of younger people, the interest rates charged on student debt are much higher than they really should be.All this is helping to feed a shift in attitudes towards borrowing among millennials. Buy now and pay later is increasingly seen as more viable, in part because low rates mean this is not seen as debt but instead as a more convenient and sensible way to pay. Before credit controls were relaxed in the 1980s, this was viewed as borrowing on the “never-never” — where only part of the cost was paid immediately and the rest over time, but often then at high borrowing rates. Then people did it because they had no other options more interesting is that it is now made by choice, because rates are low.Although interest rates look set to rise this year, they will still be low by historic standards. Many of these challenges look set to persist long into the future.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Martin Reynolds will stay in his role and has \u0026#39full confidence\u0026#39 of Boris Johnson after Downing Street party emailCovid latest news: School leaders back five-day isolation as classes of 120 children cram into halls amid teacher shortageHow are my local hospitals coping with Covid?

It also helps protect those who face serious financial difficulties to clear up problems for which they were not responsible. The cladding scandal that arose out of the Grenfell Tower fire disaster in 2017 is a case in point. Thousands of leaseholders living in high and medium-rise buildings were left in fear for their safety and in despair for their financial wellbeing. Until the cladding is removed, many of their homes are at risk and unsellable.These leaseholders face huge bills through no fault of their own. Under an earlier attempt to address this unfairness, no one living in a high-rise block would have to pay for the removal and replacement of cladding, while leaseholders in lower-rise buildings were to be offered low-interest loans capped at £50 a month. Michael Gove, who assumed the housing brief last year, has taken a different approach. He says the costs should fall much more heavily on the construction industry — a policy shift that saw £1 billion wiped off property company shares yesterday.He has given builders just a few weeks to come up with a scheme to contribute £4 billion to a fund that will repair unsafe buildings between 11 and 18 metres high (the Government has already committed £5  billion of public money to remove cladding from taller buildings, backed by an industry levy). Mr Gove threatened them with a new tax if they failed to comply.It should not be necessary to use such a heavy-handed approach. The construction industry has done well in recent years, benefiting from taxpayer-subsidised help to buy schemes, and should be prepared to reach an accommodation to help the cladding group. Mr Gove is principally after those who mis-sold cladding but since many have gone out of business, this might be impossible to do other than through a further levy on the entire industry.There are obvious holes in the plan, including what happens to people living in buildings under 11 metres and who pays for other non-cladding measures now being demanded by lenders, such as fire breaks and insulation. Mr Gove was right to say using the tax system was “a blunt instrument”. But if the builders won’t recognise their responsibilities, he may have no option.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Martin Reynolds will stay in his role and has \u0026#39full confidence\u0026#39 of Boris Johnson after Downing Street party emailCovid latest news: School leaders back five-day isolation as classes of 120 children cram into halls amid teacher shortageHow are my local hospitals coping with Covid?

Even when he wins, he loses, with crowds loudly willing his opponent on. His astonishing resilience on court is dismissed as robotic, his superhuman fitness a form of sneering at more frail, fallible mortals.That public antipathy may initially have blinded the world to the grotesque treatment he endured in Australia. One thing is certain, it would never have happened to Roger Federer. But there is something deeply chilling about the sight of a man deemed a political threat, on his own, being spirited away by the heavies at an airport. It is the kind of thing that happens to Alexei Navalny flying into Moscow, not the world No 1 tennis player arriving to defend his title in a liberal democracy.Yet his youth and fitness are a reminder of why some vaccine strategies have gone off the rails, not just in Australia, but in Europe too. For the evidence suggests that whether it is a young tennis player, or young drinkers out trying to enjoy themselves, the wrong people are being targeted by harsh vaccine restrictions around the world.Djokovic challenges a draconian Covid strategy down under that has governed life for countless months. It is, as Dominic Wilkinson, professor of medical ethics at the University of Oxford, points out, a strategy founded in the nation’s isolation, which has allowed it to pretend it can cut itself off from the pandemic. But as Wilkinson, himself half-English and half-Australian, also notes: “The difficulty was always going to be in sustaining that.”Like every other government, the Australian authorities are weighing up how to get back to normal life. Given we cannot eliminate the disease, the path to attaining this, says Wilkinson, is obvious: ensure enough people have enough immunity to prevent Covid posing a serious threat. “The question is how do you get from here to there?” The answer is building populations’ resistance through either vaccination or “natural immunity” – catching Covid and fighting it off. Or both. Djokovic argues that, having recently recovered from Covid, he benefits from natural immunity. But in a country where Covid has until recently been rare, and which has still recorded less than a million cases, compared to 14.5 million in the UK, natural immunity is dismissed. Vaccination is king.Even in the UK, where so many of us have caught the disease, this “natural immunity” defence is still officially considered suspect. Hence the Health Secretary Sajid Javid’s shock on being told last week by Steve James, an ICU consultant at Kings College Hospital, that James had not yet been vaccinated and did not want to be, because “the science is not strong enough”.It is easy to protest, as Dr Peter English, a former consultant in communicable disease control, did yesterday, that healthcare workers refusing vaccines are “irresponsible” because they risk both transmitting the disease to vulnerable patients and, potentially, falling ill and taking up an NHS bed themselves.Yet, on the risk of infection, as Dr Julian Tang, clinical virologist, respiratory sciences, at the University of Leicester, has pointed out, “natural infection with viruses generally provides longer lasting and broader immune protection, compared to vaccination”.And, on transmission, Javid’s own Department of Health has just released a study showing that while vaccines cut transmission for the original Covid strain, new strains see both vaccinated and unvaccinated people transmitting the virus at similar rates.This is, as Wilkinson is at pains to point out, not to suggest that immunity acquired from catching Covid is somehow preferable to getting a jab. The dangers of contracting Covid are far greater than any potential vaccine side effects. “I think there are strong reasons to have a vaccine for health professionals,” he says. “The question is whether it’s ethically justified to force people to have a vaccine if they have had a confirmed infection… because there is reasonable evidence that those who have had the vaccine and those who have had an infection have similar protection from infection and risk of passing on the virus.”Across the Atlantic, there are similar doubts. “If you listen to the language of our public health officials, they talk about the vaccinated and the unvaccinated,” Marty Makary, professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University told the British Medical Journal last autumn, in an article reviewing a host of studies that described similar protection from vaccine and infection-led immunity. “If we want to be scientific, we should talk about the immune and the non-immune.”It is a distinction certain to become ever more stark, ever more fraught, because of the increasing use of vaccine mandates around the world by governments, schools and employers – Italy is even banning the unvaccinated from ski lifts. Ignoring infection history also throws broader government vaccination policy, beyond vaccine mandates, into doubt, in the UK as much as in Australia.Here, young people have been targeted with measures requiring them to show proof of vaccination to enter nightclubs. As many in the industry predicted, it appears to be having little effect. Latest ONS figures show the highest rates of infection among young adults. Indeed, a year into the vaccination campaign, it is beginning to become clear who is most in need of jabs and boosters. And the answer is the same as at the start of the pandemic. Then policy was framed as if the virus did not discriminate. It soon became clear this was not true. The elderly and those with co-morbidities were very much more at risk. The same people, it seems clear, should be the focus of vaccination campaigns.Indeed, demonising the unvaccinated, notably the young and fit, is almost certainly counter-productive. In the first six months of last year, 67 per cent of the population received at least their first jab. Since then, however, only another 10 per cent have come forward, leaving almost a quarter entirely unjabbed. Discounting children under 12, not yet eligible for a vaccine, that leaves up to six million Britons unjabbed. Many are teenagers and young adults, up to a third of whom are not fully vaccinated.But in some areas, particularly in London, over a quarter of over-60s are not double jabbed. Ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately. In the latest ONS figures, the lowest third-dose and booster vaccination coverage was among Pakistani (42.2 per cent), black Caribbean (44.4 per cent) and black African (45.4 per cent) ethnic groups. Almost all white people aged 80 and above are fully jabbed, while only four out of five black people over 80 are, which a government report last month blamed for higher death rates among minorities.These are the groups that would most benefit from the protection of vaccines. Yet coercion is unlikely to change their minds. Indeed, it is a blunt tool. In the latest ONS survey, fewer than two in 10 of those hesitant to have a vaccine said needing one to work or go on holiday might make them change their mind. The most persuasive reason, for the slim minority willing to countenance it, was altruism – to protect others.These millions are not anti-vaxxers – militant, headline-hogging campaigners calling doctors and nurses administering jabs murderers. But they are damned by association, making many even more reluctant to come forward now. Some GPs, like Dr Azhar Farooqi, in Leicester, have realised a less confrontational approach is required. Having noticed that many of his highest-risk patients, particularly from poorer or ethnic minority backgrounds, were turning down the jab, he telephoned them personally for a reassuring chat. On the spot, 70 per cent changed their minds.It is the very opposite of the French president Emmanuel Macron’s decision to “p––– off” the unvaccinated, making it increasingly hard for them to live without it. Indeed, insisting people take vaccines to protect themselves is not just of questionable effectiveness, it is also morally wrong, says Wilkinson. “It’s a bad ethical reason, it’s a paternalistic reason, it says government knows better than you what to do with your own health.”More from NewsPolitics latest news: Martin Reynolds will stay in his role and has \u0026#39full confidence\u0026#39 of Boris Johnson after Downing Street party emailCovid latest news: School leaders back five-day isolation as classes of 120 children cram into halls amid teacher shortageHow are my local hospitals coping with Covid?

This would have been a very busy area at that time, and you can imagine people loading and unloading goods when they arrived here.”Jim McKeon, the Museum of London Archaeology project manager at the site, said building the road showed “clever town planning” by locals who exploited the settlement’s position near the River Cherwell and the Fosse Way Roman road.The well-connected town likely shipped livestock and agricultural goods towards London, and its newfound wealth from the third century is revealed by the luxuries coming the other way, including glass vessels, jewellery, and high-status pottery from Gaul.Hundreds of Roman coins have also been found by the 70 archaeologists working at the site, along with chemical compounds used to make ancient make-up, and ornate scale weights for weighing merchants’ wares.Shackles have also been found at the site, which may indicate slaves were traded in the area.The town plan, which helped the local economy, also segregated the settlement and archaeologists have found what they have termed a Roman “B-road”, leading traffic away from the residential area to the equivalent of an “industrial estate”.Mr McKeon said: “It has been well thought out. Just like today, you don’t want the smelly, heavy industry near where you live.”Excavations have found evidence of large fires, indicating the area may have been used to bake large quantities of bread, or as a foundry or pottery kiln. Experts have also unearthed evidence of a holding area for livestock.Both working areas are set apart from larger residences in the settlement, which may have been several stories, and indicate the newfound wealth of locals.Whilst the town appears to have enjoyed a boom period under Roman rule, estimated to have lasted from about 250AD to 350AD, the settlement appears to have suffered an economic bust following the end of Roman rule in the early fifth century.Mr McKeon said: “Once the Empire begins to recede, those trade links with Europe begin to disappear. There just aren’t the same opportunities.”Archaeological evidence suggests that the site went quickly out of use following this economic collapse, as the local population returned to the subsistence agriculture that predominated in the area before Roman rule.Mr McKeon believes that the site’s 10 metre-wide road may have been quickly covered and lost during this period, saying: “Just like today, if today you left a motorway unused, it wouldn’t take long before it would become covered by soil and vegetation.”The hidden road, made up of several layers of stone arranged in different sizes, would also have made the area impossible to plough for later farmers, and as a result the site has remained well-preservedThe Museum of London Archaeology team working along the HS2 rail line has found evidence of 30 Iron Age roundhouses and a road from the period before Romanisation and the village becoming a prominent trading hub. So far, only uncovered above five acres of the settlement, which geophysical surveys suggest could be 26 acres in size.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Martin Reynolds will stay in his role and has \u0026#39full confidence\u0026#39 of Boris Johnson after Downing Street party emailCovid latest news: School leaders back five-day isolation as classes of 120 children cram into halls amid teacher shortageHow are my local hospitals coping with Covid?

Then, it was almost universally reported, Boris Johnson was tottering on his papier-mâché throne.His party had lost the North Shropshire by-election. He was mired in supposedly very shocking allegations about whether a party or a gathering had taken place in 10 Downing Street a year earlier, and there was some more stuff about his wallpaper. A hundred Conservative MPs had rebelled against his reimposition of some restrictions because of the omicron variant. Was his time running out, asked the BBC in its most hopeful tone of voice.Now it is reported that omicron is not killing people in any significant numbers. Even NHS chiefs, usually Eeyores, admit that it is not being overwhelmed. Ministers suggest that further restrictions are unlikely to be needed. Fresh revelations about No10 parties might revive the Boris on the brink headlines, but with rather less conviction. The explanation for these comical changes of political fortune is Covid-19 itself. Whenever people feel a setback in recovery, they turn against the Prime Minister. Whenever they feel renewed hope, they feel all right about him. It is pretty much as simple as that.Few seem to learn the lesson, which is that the disease is a classic example of Kipling’s famous test of “If you can meet with triumph and disaster And treat those two impostors just the same”. Anyone who has proclaimed social collapse and bubonic plague-like mortality has been proved wrong. So has anyone who has announced we have “licked the virus”.The most one can tentatively say about Boris’s handling of it all is that it went fairly badly at first and then went better after the vaccine. Britain has been neither disgraced nor exalted in the eyes of the world as a result. The Prime Minister deserves neither a speeded-up Knighthood of the Garter nor a P45.Only when the illness does more or less go quiet will people form a settled judgment. Then they will weigh the costs, of all kinds. Perhaps the test example will be energy prices. Will their enormous rises be excused on the grounds that the explosion in demand – and therefore price – is essentially a temporary Covid by-product? Or will voters question the underlying, much longer-term upward trend caused by the delusion that we face a “climate emergency” so severe that no cost incurred trying to prevent it is too great?On which last point, it might clarify minds if the Government could state baldly its policy on gas: it is that we must, at almost any cost, import it rather than produce it.Faced with the awkward fact that the intermittency of renewables absolutely requires fossil fuel back-up for the accurately foreseeable future, the Government tacitly recognises the need. Like the Pharisees in the Gospel, however, it worries more about taint to its own purity than doing what is actually good. So it cannot bear to give permission for fracking or assist more North Sea gas production, but does not mind being dependent on expensive supplies from foreign powers, some of which will exploit their power over us for hostile political ends.Their gas production, of course, will add more carbon dioxide to the planet, but “off the books” as far as Britain is concerned. Britain’s “consumption-based” emissions are much higher than our “production-based” ones and the gap between the two has been growing. This may be good for President Putin, but does nothing for the planet and nothing but harm to the British consumer’s pocket.Going through an old photograph album, I found a picture I had taken on my first visit to India, 40 years ago. It was of a plaque erected by the Indian government beside the British memorial in Delhi to those British and Indians (roughly 1,250) killed by the rebels in the Indian Mutiny of 1857. It reads: “The ‘enemy’ of the inscriptions on this monument were those who rose against colonial rule and fought bravely for national liberation.” The “heroism of these immortal martyrs” was thus commemorated on the 25th anniversary of Indian independence in 1972, it adds.In the light of recent events, I was interested by this early example of “retain and explain”. The words are quite fierce, but they are pinned on an adjoining wall rather than obscuring the original monument. Nothing is toppled or defaced. How much more dignified than that little mob in Bristol.Last week’s item about Desmond Tutu’s time as a curate in England has produced several charming responses from readers.One is a letter from “D M Tutu”, which appeared in Cranleigh parish magazine after he and his family had spent a month in a borrowed house in Horsham Road in that Surrey village in 1963: “We take back with us only the happiest of memories – of strangers stopping to give us a cheery ‘Hello’: of an old lady crossing the road to shake us by the hand to welcome us to her village: of transport generously put at our disposal: of friendly and helpful shopkeepers, who were not trying all the time to palm off dubious goods on unsuspecting visitors – I could go on, multiplying examples of your warm friendliness.”Another is a further example of Tutu’s amusement about skin colour differences: he loved it when someone unthinkingly described him as “tickled pink”.More from NewsCovid latest news: School leaders back five-day isolation as classes of 120 children cram into halls amid teacher shortagePolitics latest news: Martin Reynolds will stay in his role and has \u0026#39full confidence\u0026#39 of Boris Johnson after Downing Street party emailHow are my local hospitals coping with Covid?

Close contact with others – especially in unventilated spaces – increases your chances of spreading Covid-. If you’re spending the festive season with loved ones there are lots of ways you can reduce the risk, including taking regular rapid lateral flow tests, letting fresh air in and getting your booster. GP Dr Claire Ashley provides some simple tips for staying safe so you and those close to you can gather round the table and enjoy your Christmas fun. Take those tests  Meeting up with loved ones  You should all do a rapid lateral flow test before you mingle.They’re free, easy to do at home and the results show in half an hour – to order a pack, go to nhs.uk get-tested.“If you haven’t got any symptoms, rapid lateral flow tests are very good at picking up Covid-,” says Dr Ashley, based in the South West. “On Christmas morning, before granny comes over for lunch, taking a test is the best way to check you’re not infectious. “My family will all have a rapid lateral flow test the morning we travel down to see my parents, andanything comes back positive, or any of us has symptoms, we won’t go. “I’m aware our plans might be disrupted. It’s not perfect, especially after last year, but I’d rather everyone stays safe.”  As Dr Ashley points out, rapid lateral flow tests are designed to pick up Covid- cases with no symptoms, soyou do have symptoms such as a fever, cough or loss of sense of taste or smell, you need to isolate immediately and take a PCR test. Andyour rapid lateral flow test does show a positive result, you’ll need to isolate and only leave the house to take a PCR test to confirm it.If you have been in contact with someone with Covid- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. If you test positive or develop symptoms in those seven days, you must self-isolate, take a PCR test and follow the guidance on gov.uk.If you are unvaccinated, you must self-isolate for  daysyou are in contact with someone who has Covid-.Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who’s tested positive, so keep it on.Open the window sLetting fresh air into your home is one way to help reduce the spread of Covid-. Opening windows and doors for just  minutes will help. “Covid- is an airborne virus and the research suggests that when you’re in a well-ventilated space the risk of contracting it is reduced,” says Dr Ashley. “That’s why being outdoors is much more safe, but that’s tricky when it’s very cold. Soyou want to reduce the chances of Covid- being passed on, have the windows open so you get as much airflow as possible.” Wear a face covering You must wear a face covering in public areas such as shops, places of worship, entertainment venues, and on public transport. It’s wise to wear a mask in crowded or enclosed spaces, eventhey’re not legally required. “Face coverings are really effective at reducing how much you’re spreading Covid-,” explains Dr Ashley. Get your booster Every adult in the country now needs to get a Covid- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Book yours now at nhs.uk covidvaccination.Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent than ever before with Covid- because Omicron is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a Covid- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.If you haven’t had your first or second vaccine, go to nhs.uk covidvaccination or call  to book it, or find your nearest walk-in centre.“It’s also very important for pregnant women to get vaccinated,” adds Dr Ashley. “The benefits of being vaccinated and boosted really outweigh the risks.”People with lower immune systems might need to be more careful about socialising this Christmas, as they could have less protection against getting severely ill with Covid-.

The PM is now under fire as he dodges questions about his alleged attendance at the garden partyThe PM is facing further questions about parties at Downing Street Image: Getty ImagesByBenjamin LynchSEO Writer:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | commentsThe Prime Minister is under fire once again after a leaked party invite email was revealed. Stories of alleged parties during lockdown and Boris Johnsonaposs attendance are currently being investigated by top civil servant Sue Gray, and now there are new questions for the PM to answer. The fresh allegation is based on a leaked email sent during lockdown by Boris Johnsonaposs Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds, which involves the proposal for socially distanced drinks and was sent to around to  No  staff. Former advisor Dominic Cummings claimed he and another special advisor protested that the event seemed to be against the rules and should not happen. In a post on his Substack newsletter, he wrote: We were ignored. I was ill and went home to bed early that afternoon but am told this event definitely happened. So far, the PM has refused to deny his attendance. So what did the email say and why is the PM in trouble  The leaked email  Witnesses have since estimated that between  to  people attended a gathering on May ,  and sources claimed the PM went along with his we Carrie, where there were tables with drinks, crisps, sausage rolls and picnic food. The gathering was advertised in an email, seen by ITV, which carried the subject line Socially Distanced Drinks! [OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE-No  ONLY].  Around  staff are believed to have been invited, including the PMaposs advisors, door staff and speechwriters. It read: Hi all, after what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No  garden this evening. Please join us from pm and bring your own booze! Why is Boris Johnson in trouble   An official inquiry is currently looking into claims of parties in lockdown in Downing Street and Whitehall. According to sources, the contents of the email mean Sue Gray will have to interview the PM himself in her investigation into parties. On the same day as the email, the Met Police released a video on strict guidance for those who wanted to leave the house. People were not allowed to mix with those outside their households.  Since the new allegations came to light, the Met released a statement stating they are in contact with Downing Street over alleged breaches. Previously, they have deemed reported instances in Whitehall as unworthy of investigation.A Met spokesperson said: The politan Police Service is aware of widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches of the Health Protection Regulations at Downing Street on  May  and is in contact with the Cabinet Office.Boris Johnson has also come under fire for hosting a Christmas quiz in No.  last year.Sue Grayaposs investigation  Several instances of alleged gatherings have been reported. In December, government adviser Allegra Stratton resigned after she was caught on camera joking with other advisers about a Christmas gathering that had involved cheese and wine. In the wake of this, the PM said to the House of Commons: I can understand how infuriating it must be to think that the people who have been setting the rules, have not been following the rules, because I was also furious.  Ms Gray is understood to be investigating four events in  which the PM is thought to have attended:May : Garden party at No .in which Boris and Carrie Johnson were pictured in the garden with wine, cheese and more than a dozen other people. No said this was an outdoor work meeting.May : Second garden party at No . with more than  staff told to aposBYOBapos by top civil servant Martin Reynolds.November : Leaving do Sources told the Mirror  to  people crammed into a room in No  to see off top aide Cleo Watson.December : Christmas quiz The Prime Minister was pictured on screen, sitting beneath a portrait of Margaret Thatcher, as he read out questions. He was flanked by two colleagues, one wearing a Santa hat, while the other was draped in tinsel. Who is Martin Reynolds   The invitation email was sent by Downing Street civil servant Martin Reynolds. Reynolds was appointed as Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister in  and has previously been an ambassador to Libya. Key details of the email, including the phrase socially distanced drinks, have caused speculation over Reynoldsapos future in the role. His role means he works extremely closely with the PM, who has so far refused to deny any attendance at the alleged party.  The PM said: All that, as you know, is the subject of a proper investigation by Sue Gray. Downing Street also refused to comment three times on whether the PM attended. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: As Iaposve made clear before there’s an independent process going on to look into this led by Sue Gray and I canapost comment further while thataposs taking place.

In an opposition day debate in the Commons, the party will put forward a motion which,passed, would force MPs to vote on the proposals.More than two dozen Tory MPs have in recent years pledged to scrap the tax off home energy bills, including Boris Johnson himself. The Government is expected to abstain on the vote with ministers privately admitting No  needs to get on the front foot over the issue. Mr Johnson told reporters that he understands how people are struggling and he was looking at what we can do to help. Labour wants to impose a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers to fund measures to ease the cost of living squeeze, by reducing the average household energy bill by £. Fossil fuel giants would be forced to contribute £.bn to help fund the proposals, through a year-long increase to their corporation tax of %. The £.bn plan would also include removing VAT on domestic energy bills for a whole year, as well as expanding and increasing the warm homes discount to . million people. The Government has so far resisted making moves on VAT with the PM dismissing it as a blunt instrument and Nadhim Zahawi saying oil and gas firms were already struggling. However, Labour claimed the industry was expected to report a near-record income in  .They pointed to previous Tory pledges on VAT on energy bills by senior Tories including Mr Johnson, Michael Gove, Priti Patel and Esther McVey and  others.Mr Johnson said in  that leaving the EU would allow the UK to scrap VAT on energy bills, calling it unfair. Shadow climate change minister Ed Miliband said: All the Tory MPs who have previously backed a VAT cut on home energy bills should follow through with their promises and vote with Labour today to scrap the tax for a year, as hard-working people face a growing cost-of-living crisis. It tells you everything you need to know about this Government that they believe we should prioritise oil and gas companies making huge windfall profits that they say are aposstrugglingapos, rather than the British people who face the true struggle to pay their energy bills. No  has admitted that ministers recognise that people are facing increased costs on things like both food and fuel globally. But Labour rejected that the issues were caused solely by global factors, instead pointing to what they called a decade of failure on energy.

There have been dficulties keeping track of case numbers in recent weeks due to shortages of lateral flow testsand polymerase chain reactiontests. Despite this, case numbers have remained high and have reached record levels since the Omicron iant took a hold on the country. The UKaposs official Covid death toll passed , on Saturday January . Prime Minister Boris Johnsonaposs government is currently drawing up plan for a living with Covid strategy, which aims to avoid any long-term restrictions in England from March this year.The proposed rule changes may seem like a contradiction to some, so what are they and who do they affect  What is the PCR test rule change   Currently, people who test positive for Covid with no symptoms on a lateral flow test are required to take a PCR to confirm their status. This will change from January .They will still have to isolate for at least seven days, but only from the date of their positive lateral flow test.Head of Imperial College Londonaposs Department of Primary Care  Public Health, Professor Azeem Majeed told the i that the move is a positive step. He said: If you’re positive on lateral flow teststhat’s almost certainly diagnostic of a Covid- infection in the current situation we’re in, as infection rates are so high.By not then having to take a PCR test, it takes pressure off the PCR testing system. What should I doI have a positive LFT   Anyone who tests positive for the virus through an LFT should report their status immediately. The UK Health Security Agencyhas given guidance of how to do this and what will occur afterwards.They said: Under this new approach, anyone who receives a positive LFD test result should report their result on Gov.UK and must self-isolate immediately but will not need to take a follow-up PCR test. At the moment, isolation rules mean that a fully vaccinated person can stop isolating after seven days, proving they take a lateral flow test every day and are negative on days six and seven and have no symptoms. A move to a five-day isolation period is now under consideration. The PM told reporters today: Yes of course, we are looking at that and we will act accordingly to the science as we always have. Is the change to testing permanent   The change brought in has been described as a temporary measure while cases remain high. The UKHSA said: This is a temporary measure while Covid- rates remain high across the UK. Whilst levels of Covid- are high, the vast majority of people with positive [LFT] results can be confident that they have Covid-. The idea is that while cases are in such high numbers, symptoms and a positive test are more likely than normal to indicate the virus. Meanwhile, while case numbers are infrequent and low, a PCR test might be needed to show a positive infection.  The new approach reflects similar changes made this time last year in January , when there was also a high prevalence of infection meaning it was highly likely that a positive [LFT] Covid- result was a true positive. This meant confirmatory PCRs were temporarily paused and reintroduced in March  following a reduction in prevalence.

The Housing Secretary axed £-a-month loans for people in “medium-rise” blocks to pay for fixing cladding. Instead, people in buildings - metres high will not pay a penny for addressing cladding issues after Grenfell. But that’s not strictly true. People are still having to pay for waking watches non-cladding issues aren’t covered by the scheme and people who’ve already doled out cash won’t get it back. Mr Gove announced “we will make industry pay” to fix problems for people in leasehold flats. Those who manufactured combustible cladding and insulation - many of whom have made vast profits, even at the height of the pandemic - they must pay now instead of leaseholders,” he said. There will be £m spent on fire alarms in high-risk buildings and legal amendments will allow flat owners to get compensation for defects up to  years ago .Yet there are questions about what will happenhousing developers try to wriggle out of meeting the bill, as well as when a final package in England will take effect. Here are nine wrinkles in the small print of the plan.Other costs are not includedThe government announced: “No leaseholder living in their own flat will have to pay a penny to fix unsafe cladding.” But critics pointed out residents face many other costs while they wait for their cladding issues to be resolved. MP Clive Efford said residents in one block “have been paying out £, a month for waking watch for nearly four years.” And others have faced higher-than-usual insurance costs lumped into their service charge. Mr Gove insisted: “We are making money available to ensure that we can get rid of waking watch, in all save a very few circumstances.”Non-cladding defects are not includedA leaked letter from the Treasury suggests the plan was not allowed to cover “non-cladding” defects. This is important because cladding is not the only problem any more on blocks of flats. Stricter fire safety laws mean all sorts of issues can be flagged. Shadow Housing Secretary Lisa Nandy said leaseholders “face ruinous costs to fix things such as missing fire breaks and defective compartmentation.” She accused Mr Gove of “abandoning” people with non-cladding safety issues adding: “One cannot make a building half safe.” Mr Gove insisted legal protection is being improved and he agreed “non-cladding costs do need to be met.” Buildings under  metres tall are not includedThe new guidance means residents in all buildings over  metres tall should have their cladding costs covered. But MP Fleur Anderson raised the case of a building under  metres where residents are facing a £m bill. While the biggest issues were in taller buildings, there are still some who could be caught out. Mr Gove admitted: “We require everything to go right in order to be able to help everyone who’s currently facing dficulties.” “I would not want at this stage to provide an absolute guarantee for people whose specic circumstances I’m not yet familiar with.“Some people will still face dficult red tapeMr Gove vowed to “restore common sense to building assessments” by cutting down on the number of “unnecessary” surveys and reports. There will also be “far greater use of sensible, risk-mitigating fire safety measures such as sprinklers and alarms”. And the government is withdrawing interim guidance on needing “EWS” forms - on the external structure of a wall. But there are questions about exactly how many of these forms will be left. Some fear there could still be run-ins between dferent companies or agencies disagreeing about what’s needed. Whatthose who are told to pay up, don’t The government did not say what will happendevelopers refuse or fail to meet the bill. Michael Gove told MPs: “We will give them the chance to do the right thing. I hope that they will take it.“I can confirm to the House today thatthey do not, we will impose a solution on them,necessary, in law.” But there are several questions about whether firms will try to avoid paying the bill. Mr Gove said the “ultimate owners” of a building will be targeted, but there can be complex structures with owners, developers and managers all dferent entities.Will the tax threat be empty Michael Gove pointed out he has been “authorised” to raise the “prospect” of taxing building firm giants. But Ms Nandy pointed out a leaked letter from the Treasury. It showed ministers have warned a decision to impose new taxes is not a given at this point. It appears what heaposs told the public - that tax rises are the backstop - is not what heaposs told the Treasury, she said.Will Mr Gove be forced to rely on his own department’s housing budgets Some fear the policy could ‘rob Peter to pay Paul’developers fail to pay and there is no tax either. The leaked Treasury letter confirmed the Housing Department’s own budget is a “backstop” for the £bn cost. And housing select committee chairman Clive Betts raised fears it could harm new social housing. He said: If developers donapost pay for the measures in the House today or taxes arenapost raised and there are cuts to his budget as a result, is that going to come off social housing provision as well  What assessment has been done for the total impact on future housebuilding for social housing  Mr Gove replied only that he would “do everything possible” to avoid an impact on social housing.How long will we wait Mr Gove told MPs: “I will today write to developers to convene a meeting in the next few weeks, and I will report back to the House before Easter.“ His department said the industry had been “given two months to agree to a financial contributions scheme to fund the new plan, otherwise,necessary, the government will impose a solution in law.” But he did not give a hard deadline for when a plan or law will actually be finalised, or take effect. Labour MP for Putney Fleur Anderson asked: When will the deadline for this chance to do the right thing be up “Otherwise we could just be kicking the can down the road. Leaseholders in Putney will want to know when they can expect to be able to sell their homes to move on.People won’t get their money backSome leaseholders have already paid out money to fix issues with their flats. Yet Mr Gove insisted the government “can’t resolve every issue from the past”. He added: I canapost unfortunately... say that we will be in a position to compensate those who have already contributed. What weaposre seeking to do is to ensure that iniduals do not face costs in the future. But again I will work with colleagues across this House in order to try to get to the most equitable position possible.

Oliver Dowden issued the warning moments before the “bring your own booze” bash - which multiple sources claim Boris Johnson attended with his we Carrie. And just five days later, the Prime Minister himself said police should intervene to stop people having outdoor parties. Mr Johnson has been plunged into a fresh scandal over the bash on May , .A bombshell e-mail obtained by ITV News showed more than  No staff were invited by the PM’s top civil servant and told to ‘bring your own booze’.Outdoor gatherings were banned in England at the time under Covid rules. Now footage has emerged of then-Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden speaking at a No press conference, just  minutes before the pm bash out the back door.  He urged hard-pressed citizens to “limit contact with other people”, and said: “You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place - provided that you stay two metres apart. The Cabinet minister warned “staying alert for the vast majority of people still means staying at home as much as possible.”Mr Dowden added: “If everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus.“This is how we can continue to save lives and livelihoods as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.”  Just five days after the outdoor gathering, Boris Johnson said police should intervene to stop outdoor gatherings. He was asked by a member of the public: “There are large groups gathering in local parks, ignoring social distancing rules. When many of us are being so vigilant and staying alert, what can be done to discourage this disregard for the rules ” The PM replied: “Feel free to speak to people yourselfyou feel that they are not obeying the rules. “But the police will step innecessary and encourage people to obey the law. Boris Johnson ’s Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds faces a fight for his job after the May  e-mail was revealed by ITV News. And sources now expect Whitehallaposs parties investigator Sue Gray will have to interview the Prime Minister himself - as he was said to have been present at four of the events she is looking into.In a screenshot of the email obtained by ITV News, Mr Reynolds wrote: Hi all, after what has been an incredibly busy period it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No garden this evening.Please join us from pm and bring your own booze!According to the BBC, staff raised questions privately at the time with one saying: “Um. Why is Martin encouraging a mass gathering in the garden ”.Another wrote: “Is this for real ” The May  gathering was revealed last week by ex-Downing Street aideDominic Cummings , who has gone to war with his former boss since leaving Government in November .Hannah Brady, spokesperson for Covid  Bereaved Families for Justice, said: My Dad died just four days before this email was sent out, he was only  and was a fit and healthy key worker.” She added: “How can those running the country have thought it was OK  Could there be a more disgraceful example of aposone rule for them, and another rule for the rest of usapos  “To make matters worse, in September last year I sat in that same Garden, looked the Prime Minister in the eyes and told him how my dad had died. “He told me he had ‘done everything he could’ to protect my Dad, knowing that he had partied in that same spot the very day that Dad’s death certicate was signed. “It makes me feel sick to think about it.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonCabinetCivil servantsPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Kate Grfiths said I am no longer silenced by the family courts” and I can speak out” after a y saga involving her ex Andrew Grfiths. Mr Grfiths used to be the MP for Burton and the minister for small business, and once worked as former prime minister Theresa Mayaposs chief of staff.He resigned in  after the Sunday Mirror revealed he sent depraved messages to two constituents.  The Grfiths, both , became embroiled in private family court proceedings, centred on a child, after separating.During those proceedings, a family court judge concluded that, on the balance of probability, Mr Grfiths had raped and physically abused Ms Grfiths.  Ms Grfiths was speaking on a Tortoise Media podcast after Court of Appeal judges ruled the rape finding could be made public. Ms Grfiths said the pair met in  before Mr Grfiths became an MP, and began a relationship  months later. He was great, he was funny, he was a charmer, said Ms Grfiths. I thought he was an all-round good guy. He was very attentive. Ms Grfiths said people would say they were an ideal couple. But she added: By the end of the relationship, I had just become a shadow of my former self. Three appeal judges last month ruled the family court judgeaposs findings could be made public after a -month legal fight by two media organisations - Tortoise and PA Media. Ms Grfiths had waived her right to anonymity and supported the fight by journalists. She said publication would allow her to help constituents. Itaposs like a feeling of freedom, she said. Mr Grfiths had strongly denied allegations made against him, and argued that the family court judgeaposs findings should not be made public.

Today the Daily Mirror takes a detailed look at le in areas the Conservatives claim they now care about. The picture is bleak, with little or no progress since Boris Johnson won an -seat majority at the  General Election. Over-promising and under-delivering is a hallmark of this Prime Minister. The rundown school we highlight today, where heroic teachers and other staff struggle to keep going in crumbling buildings, is unfortunately not an exception. Working people deserve better and the pupils deserve an education in fit-for-purpose facilities. But in this country Government policies are levelling us down instead of up. Staff our NHS  With an understaffed NHS on its knees, axing key staff because they are unvaccinated would be self-destructive. The boss of one of London’s busiest hospitals warning as many as % of his workforce could need moving shows what happens when the tricky real world collides with Whitehall diktat. Of course, those in the health service should be jabbed, to protect patients, colleagues and the public as well as themselves. Yet the no jab, no job order could prove ruinous to the provision of healthcare. Daily pre-work tests are expensive and burdensome but it would surely be better to use them than to lose the skills and expertise of people who, for whatever reason, have failed to get inoculated, or chosen not to. Pitch in, Andy The Duke of York’s ongoing legal troubles in the US civil courts cast a dark shadow over the Queen’s planned Platinum Jubilee celebrations in early June.

Lord Evans said the stories on lockdown breaching parties, first revealed by the Mirror, had cut through with the public, as the affairs have now caused public concern. Giving evidence to the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee , Lord Evans said the public expects MPs to live up to the standards they profess to live up to. Tory rebel William Wragg, chairman of the PACAC, said Lord Evans was quite correct. It comes as the Police have made contact with the Cabinet Office over claims the PMaposs principal private secretary organised a bring your own booze party during Englandaposs first lockdown. Martin Reynolds sent an email to more than  Downing Street employees inviting them to make the most of the lovely weatherin the garden. The leaked email, obtained by ITV news, said: “Hi all, after what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No garden this evening.“Please join us from pm and bring your own booze!” Paymaster General Michael Ellis will be summoned to the Commons to answer an urgent question from Labouraposs Deputy leader Angela Rayner on the scandal at .pm today.  The peeraposs appearance in front of the PACAC committee follows the Greensill lobbying row involving former PM David Cameron.Mr Cameron was taken on as a paid adviser after he left Number , and used his contacts to send texts and e-mails to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and other ministers and senior civil servants urging them to allow Greensill to participate in a Government Covid loan scheme for businesses. Mr Cameron acknowledged there are “important lessons to be learned”. Lord Evans told MPs on the committee: “I think we have seen a whole series of issues over the last few months: the Owen Paterson affair, the attempt to change the rules over standards investigations in the middle of the investigation into Mr Paterson’s actions. “The questions around the redecoration of Downing Street, in particular the very bad processes that were clearly in place for keeping Lord Geidt properly informed. “The Greensill affair and now partygate. “All of those, I think, have demonstrated that there is – at least – a carelessness amongst people in Government over standards issues, and possibly no more than that.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonConservative PartyMIPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Even though the next election is two years away Mr Houchen said the Government had to start delivering tangible change now. Writing in The Times, he told the PM: “Before the next election comes around people need to see with their eyes concrete evidence that they were right to back this Government.  “Voters are also realists - they know that levelling up is not something that will be delivered in just a year or two, it will be a decades long project. But they do need to see progress.” Without early signs of change, he warned that voters could desert the Tories in droves.  Mr Houchen, who was re-elected last year with .% of the vote, said: “People like to be proven right and those who voted Conservative for the first time in  are looking for an excuse to do so again, but they will punish a Government which makes them regret their choices.” Mr Houchen claimed that the Covid vaccine and the booster roll-out would not be enough to guarantee re-election.  “It’s time for the Prime Minister to focus, remember what got him elected two years ago and what the British people need to see tohim as Prime Minister at the next election.“Boris has got booster jabs in British arms - now he needs to make sure Britain gets the Brexit boost it needs: jobs, investment, growth, levelling up and a better future for every part of our country.” Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, asked on LBC whether the PM was failing to deliver on his promises, said: “We’re going to get on with the job, we’re going to deliver investment in communities that need it.”Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyThe TimesMichael GoveBoris JohnsonPoliticsDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Detailed plans by Keir Starmer’s party would suspend VAT and slash £ from average bills, reducing heating and lighting charges for the poorest households by as much as £.

Health Minister Ed Argar was sent out to defend the Government after a bombshell email emerged showing the PMaposs aide inviting more than  No  employees to an evening gathering on May  .Martin Reynolds, the Prime Ministeraposs principal private secretary, said staff should make the most of the lovely weatherand urged them to bring your own booze, according to ITV News.Witnesses claimed about  staff attended the event, including Mr Johnson and his we Carrie - and there were long tables laden with drink, crisps, sausage rolls and other picnic food. Outdoor gatherings were banned at the time under Englandaposs Covid restrictions. Less than an hour before the gathering was due to begin, the-then Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden urged Brits to “limit contact with other people”. He told a No press conference: “You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place - provided that you stay two metres apart. What were you doing on May   email webnews@mirror Top civil servant Sue Gray is understood to be looking into at least six Westminster gatherings that took place in  as part of an official inquiry in potential rule-breaking.Sources suggested that Ms Gray was likely to interview Mr Johnson, who was believed to be present at four of the gatherings under investigation. The Met Police has confirmed it is in contact with the Cabinet Office over the claims. Mr Argar told the Today programme he could understand people might feel anger and hurt at the allegations - but he said people need to wait for Ms Grayaposs inquiry to conclude. Asked explicitlythe PM was at the event, he said: I donapost know, I donapost know. I donapost work in No  Downing Street. Pressed again, he said: I donapost know. He said he hopes Ms Gray would provide a swt report, adding: I hope it will clary all the facts around this and some of the other allegations weaposve seen about whether regulations were broken. Thataposs what she is working on, I know she is keen to get to the bottom of it...rules are found to have been broken, appropriate disciplinary action - as the PM said - should be taken. Mr Argar refused to speculate about whether the PM was there but said itaposs important rules are followed. He said he had not been invited to attend any drinks and was glued to Zoom at the time. Confronted by angry messages from listeners, he said: I can understand the anger, I can also understand the hurt and the upset from people whoaposve lost loved ones, people who werenapost able to grieve for loved ones or who werenapost able to see their loved ones, who passed away whether from Covid or something .  He said he had lost a close relative during the pandemic who he wasnapost able to see. Mr Argar added: I understand exactly how people feel about these allegations and about the impact on their children and their mental health. Tory MPs have gone to ground since the email emerged on Monday night. But former Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson tweeted: This line wonapost survive  hrs. Nobody needs an official to tell themthey were at a boozy shindig in their own garden. People arefurious. They sacriced so much - visiting sick or grieving relatives, funerals. What tf were any of these people thinking Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said:Boris Johnson ’s deflections and distractions are no longer tenable.“Sue Gray is a highly respected civil servant who will be carrying out an investigation to the highest standard. “But the truth is out now. Not only did Boris Johnson know about the parties, he attended them and he lied. “It’s time for the Prime Minister to stop hiding behind Whitehall inquiries and finally come clean.

Forget record high NHS waiting lists and crumbling schools when Tory Cabinet Ministers lie in front of giant Union Jacks to illustrate their intense patriotism. And ignore sleaze, corruption, back-handers, unfairness, inequality and fatal mistakes for, with the blessing of Culture Wars Secretary Nadine Dorries, Tory no-mark Andrew Rosindell wants the BBC to play God Save the Queen every day. Statues, flags and anthems are battlegrounds the PM’s smokescreen to ert public attention away from his tax hikes, soaring fuel bills, cost of living rises, stagnant wages and declining public services.  It is a classic, cynical Right-wing strategy to ide and rule. It played well in the past and it might work again. Magicians use misdirection as a form of deception to draw the audience’s attention from the real action. Johnson would rather voters were angry about a jury clearing four protesters over the toppling of slaver Edward Colston’s statue in Bristol than holding the PM to account for increased National Insurance or discussing Labour’s proposed windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers to compensate households who are facing huge increases in energy bills.  Suella Braverman is an Attorney-General whose ideological conviction results in much of the legal profession judging her guilty of stupidity. Even considering an appeal against the jury verdict in the Colston case is a sign the governing party will roll in the gutter. Labour leader Keir Starmer is wise to take no lectures on patriotism from a Conservative regime which inflicted the terrible national self-harm that is Brexit. But in a fight, the Labour leader is similarly wise to combat smears which saw predecessor Jeremy Corbyn unfairly tainted as hating his country. Labour wins by keeping the national conversation on big issues that really count, the Tories by changing it to emblems and frippery. Living standards or statues  The election’s choice and verdict will decide whether Britain is a progressive country moving brightly forward or stuck in the past.

The email, seen by the Financial Times, contained  “simple and cost effective ways to keep warm this winter”, and they included suggestions like having a cuddle with your pets and loved ones to help stay cosy and try cleaning the house.Other advice includes challenging the kids to a hula hoop contest, doing a few star jumps, and keep your oven open after youaposve finished cooking. The email was reportedly sent to customers of SSE Energy Service, which was acquired by Ovo in .  A spokesperson for the company went on to apologise for the poorly judged and unhelpful advice. Households in Britain are set to be hit by a rise of more than % in energy prices in April when the energy price cap is raised, which could cost Brits an extra £ on their energy bills each year. Darren Jones, the MP for Bristol North West and chair of the business select committee had called on Ovo to apologise, saying: Being told to put on a jumper instead of turning on your heatingyou canapost afford it, at a time of such dficulty, is plainly offensive. On Twitter, the reaction has been swt and damning from the public, with many mocking the advice.One user wrote: Huddle around your recently lit gas bill, and another said: Think warm thoughts. A further stated: My dad is in his ’s. Ovo have just increased his monthly bill by %. It takes him all his strength to get out of his chair but I’ll tell him to do some f****** star jumps! In a statement, a spokesperson at Ovo Energy apologised for the advice, saying: Last week a link to a blog containing energy saving tips was sent to customers. We understand how dficult the situation will be for many of our customers this year. We are working hard to find meaningful solutions as we approach this energy crisis, and we recognise that the content of this blog was poorly judged and unhelpful.

Isabelle Grundy, six, has been battling cancer for six months, and her parents are desperately seeking treatment from abroad.The youngster, from Thornton Cleveleys, was a happy little girl before her le-changing diagnosis in the summer of , LancsLive reports. Isabelle woke up complaining to mum Louisa Moss that she had a sore tummy and she was off school with a suspected bug. Her condition became worse throughout the day and Louisa found a lump on the left side of her stomach. Louisa, , said: It was quite sudden, previous to this day, I noticed she was tired but I canapost say that she was ill- when itaposs your own kids you pick up very quicklyitaposs anything more. This lump that I found in Isabelleaposs tummy it wasnapost an obvious lump and not somewhere you would go poking and prodding - I just couldnapost believe it. I kind of knew when I felt the lump and did a bit of research, I knew then and there that it wasnapost going to be good news - at the same time I was doubting myself thinking no it canapost be because of how well sheaposs been. Isabelle was seen by GPs, hospitals and specialists before she was diagnosed with a High Risk, Stage  Neuroblastoma. Such a diagnosis comes with a  per cent survival rate.A week later, she was enduring a world of appointments, therapies and treatments all before she even turned six. Since her diagnosis, Isabelle has undergone a lot of intensive treatment, ranging from high dose chemotherapy, numerous cannulas, MIBG Scans, CT scans, ultrasound scans as well as several blood and platelet transfusions.

Louisa said: On the rd of December, we just knew she wasnapost right, her tummy was distended, she needed to go to the toilet but couldnapost pass any urine. She just looked so poorly, she was wanting to sleep a lot- she went for an ultrasound on Christmas Eve morning and they found she was full of fluid. Isabelle spent Christmas and New Yearaposs in a hospital bed - not being able to open her presents. The mum added: It was heartbreaking, it was awful. It was just me and Isabelleaposs big brother on Christmas morning so we Facetimed daddy and Isabelle was completely oblivious. She was fast asleep at the time which she was like the majority of the time. We have such a big family so not seeing any our family at Christmas was hard - we didnapost want them to come up here because of Covid we just had to be so careful who we were mixing with. We canapost really say it was Christmas at all, it was just horrible. Isabelle still has a  per cent survival rate as her family are looking for other options abroad. They found a vaccination that is given in New York and it can reduce the risk of the cancer ing and will increase her chances of living a longer le. However, it will cost at least £, to get there and to receive the treatment over the course of more than two years.

Charlotte Taundry, , was playing the confectionary-based game over the New Year with partner Sarah Hutchison, , as well as their friends and family. But when it was her turn to play the game - in which players try to move one of the chocolates from their heads to their mouths without using their hands- she had to admit defeat. Speaking afterwards she explained it was because, try as she might, she could not move her face muscles because of the temporary face paralyser.In a video Sarah can be heard laughing hysterically as Charlotte, who she met on ITV ’s The Cabins, tries to move the choccie treat which refuses to budge.Charlotte, a trainee dietician, said: When that video was filmed Iaposd already been doing it five minutes. It just wasnapost happening. I just kept thinking, aposI look awfulapos - pulling the most stupid facial expressions. “But it was so funny, I had to do it. I was wiping my tears away I was laughing that much. “Hopefully it give some people a laugh. Sarah added: “I was just creasing laughing. We both have botox. We canapost tell when we’re annoyed at each other - itaposs great.  But she was determined and stuck it on her head. I watched everyone  get it to their mouth - [while Charlotte] sat there squinting and squeezing her face. It comes as the happy couple announced recently they are planning on starting IVF as they want a family.They told The Sun Charlotte will carry the baby.She said: “We know where we are going to go with it in a few years time. I’m obviously  now, so approaching the age where we need to start thinking about children. We’ve thought about stuff like that [IVF], we haven’t got an exact plan in mind but we know over the next few years it’s definitely where we are going.

The pose is far from new. It is one which has been used repeatedly down the decades to capture a young princess or duchess coming of age, their elegant footing firm on the path to queendom. As well as by female monarchs well established in their reign. Queen Victoria, Queen Mary, the Queen Mother, Princess Margaret, Diana, even Princess Grace of Monaco, not to mention our current Queen, have struck similar poses. The combination of romanticism and regality is recognisable straightaway as Kate holds a mirror to former eras. Royal commentator Ingrid Seward explains: “In this image I think you see a nod to Kate rising up the ranks. People look at her and see the perfect queen, young and beautul. “It evokes an image of the Queen as a young woman and even conjures up historically a Boadicea, strong, yet feminine - femininity yet strength. “That idealised image of a young queen, serene, in control and poised.” She adds: “Kate is coming into her own. She is genuinely involved in her charity work, which will be her legacy. “We have seen her in the peacemaker role between William and Harry, we saw her at the carol concert in Westminster stepping confidently into the spotlight, she is no longer a clothes horse, there is a strength there now. “We can see Kate stepping up a level, the coming of a queen in waiting, and I think she is more ready to fill those shoes.” But she stresses the Duchess will no doubt feel embarrassed by the attention on her position. She’s been in The Firm long enough to know she must not overstep the mark. “Prince Charles is not even King yet and the Royals are very careful about not upstaging each other. Kate will be keen not to upstage Camilla,” says Ingrid. “She is aware of hierarchy and that it is Camilla’s turn. “But she is a wonderful advert for the monarchy, especially globally, and people will see her as the perfect queen.”  Platinum puddings By Tyrese ChinDenCoy What better way to celebrate the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee this year than with cake  Her Maj has decreed a Royal Bake Off, asking the nation to come up with a pud we can all raise a spoon to. Fortnum and Mason and The Big Jubilee Lunch invite Britain’s bakers, aged eight and above, to create a dish that can be replicated across the country to celebrate the -year milestone.  Five finalists will have the chance to bake their dishes at Fortnum’s store in Piccadilly to be judged by Dame Mary Berry, palace head chef Mark Flanagan and Masterchef list Monica Galetti. Why not take some inspiration from Royal favourites, old or new  From Prince William’s chocolate biscuit cake to Henry the VIII’s favourite red wine and ginger jelly or Queen Victoria’s famous Victoria Sponge, they’re a family of sweet tooths. Henry VIII Favourite Food: Jelly Hippocras. Henry VIII was a large man and would often have over  freshly cooked dishes served for him every day. He loved his red wine and even built two fountains which spouted hundreds of gallons of the stuff for him and his courtiers to enjoy everyday. Alongside it, Henry particularly liked this jelly which included wine, ginger and cinnamon. Victoria I Favourite Food: Victoria Sponge Cake Queen Victoria was someone who enjoyed eating and was said to have had a hearty appetite. She enjoyed sweet foods from ice-creams to pastries, and cake so much that the Victoria Sponge was named after her. Duchess Kate Favourite Food: Sticky Toffee Pudding Kate’s fav foods reportedly include sushi and Italian - the latter because it’s easy to cook with ther kids and let them get their hands messy. But when it comes to favourite puds it’s a spongy Sticky Toffee Pudding. Prince William Favourite Food: Chocolate biscuit cake The Duke is a big fan of chocolate biscuit cakes, so much so the cake was served at his wedding. William’s fondness for the cake apparently comes from a specic recipe which he learnt from his grandmother, the Queen.

Gavin Quinn, a sports reporter, lost five stone in seven months with regular meals and exercise. The feat is even more astonishing because he did not once go to the gym during his weight loss journey. He puts his remarkable loss down to a combination of diet and exercise. Gavin, who writes for the Irish Mirror, shed the weight in seven months, but rewarded himself with some snacks along the way. BelfastLive reports that he had started to gain weight when he was a teenager.He said: I lost  poundsin seven months after deciding to make a change in October .Tipping the scales at around  stone, I wasnapost massively overweight but Iaposd noticed a gradual increase since I was a teenager that was accelerated by the initial Covid- lockdown.I looked into what I was eating and slowly turned around my diet and found cycling as a great way to get active to complement the changes Iaposd made. By Christmas I had lost over two stone and I kept it up in the New Year before hitting the five stone mark in May .  Gavinaposs weight continued to fall to  stoneand he eased off and worked on fitness goals rather than weight. He said for some people this was an epiphany moment similar to a favourite shirt no longer fitting them. Gavin added: But for me it was just a culmination of all the right things, I donapost have any overriding reason for making a change. At the time Ireland was staring at another Covid- lockdown which lasted seven months. Iaposd tried almost all of the aposfad dietsapos to no avail in the months and years before, and I could just feel my confidence was at an all-time-low, Gavin added. And on October , a Sunday morning, I said to myself that I need to make a change and that day would be day one. He tackled his eating and sleeping habits first and establishing a structure to his diet. Gavin gave himself a simple plan to start off with get eight hours sleep and have three meals a day at roughly the same time of day.  I set myself a rough target of , daily calories and used apps such as MyFitnessPal to help track what I was eating, Gavin added. Initially I didnapost pay too much attention to my macro-nutrients, but made an effort to ensure I was drinking plenty of water, eating foods with high fibre, vitamins and lower fat counts - particularly saturated fats. This meant I still had treats and snacks to enjoy, but the small changes slowly begin to add up and the , calories I consumed each day began to feel like more and more as the days and weeks went by. Some days it was , calories and other days it was , calories - donapost beat yourself up over going over your allowance every once in a while. Itaposs not about cutting yourself off from food, but rather improving your relationship with food.  The amazing thing about Gavinaposs weight loss was he did not join a gym. He never had great interest in the gym and hadnapost done when he was younger. Personally, I never took to the gym when I was younger and always liked to exercise as a means of engaging in a sport or activity, Gavin said. Gyms can be intimidatingyouaposve never become a member, but Iaposd suggest anybody looking to get active consider it. For me, I found a means to exercise in cycling - which has grown into somewhat of a passion for me over the past  months. Here are more of Gavinaposs aposs top tips on how he did it, from his diet to level of exercise:How did you manage your diet It can be dficult to follow a calorie deficit, when youaposre consuming less calories than youaposre burning your body is being forced to eat into fat reserves to fill that void. I made sure not to overdo it - deliberately eating just , calories per day can be too much and you could risk reverting back to old ways. Having my breakfast and lunches at very similar timeshelped build early eating habits that would set me up for the day. Again to ensure I wasnapost completely flipping my diet completely I used a degree of leniency when it came to dinner time, small changes like portion control and avoiding fatty foods when you have the option can make all the dference. Initially I found myself eating a lot of the same foods I already had, particularly snacks, but doing so meant Iaposd simply be eating less of what I used to rather than eating right. After the first week I began replacing some snack foods with lower calorie snacks, which in turn meant I had more calories to play with for my substantial meals. If I was eating a pack of  calorie crisps, Iaposd replace them with  calorie crisps, swap the Cadbury chocolate bars for lower calorie rice cake bars, treating myself to a zero calorie fizzy drink rather than a full sugar alternative. This meant I still had treats and snacks to enjoy, but the small changes slowly begin to add up and the , calories I consumed each day began to feel like more and more as the days and weeks went by. Some days it was , calories and other days it was , calories - donapost beat yourself up over going over your allowance every once in a while. Itaposs not about cutting yourself off from food, but rather improving your relationship with food.What are your favoured foods for weight loss Iaposve found so many great foods the past  months that I never enjoyed before, and Iaposd be confident in saying my relationship with food has really grown as I became more aware of what I was putting into my body. Hereaposs some of my favoured foods these days: Cous Cous: I sometimes use it as a lighter alternative to rice, itaposs easy to make and is high in carbohydrates and fibre.Rice crispy bars: Excellent for a quick snack, theyaposre a lot better than a bar of chocolate.Lentil curls: A low calorie alternative to many brands of crisps, Iaposve grown to love them.Nuts and seeds: A great snack, good source of protein and fats.Turkey burgers: Lean, high in protein and delicious - no explanation needed.Vegetables: Whatever they are eat plenty of them, theyaposre good for you and should be an essential pillar of your diet. Did you give up takeaways and alcohol Not really. Weaposve always had a aposTakeaway Fridayapos at home so I made sure to allow myself the Friday treat. Although instead of chips in the chinese takeaway some weeks Iaposd get rice or even eat a smaller portion. I initially gave up alcohol until Christmas, but when I did drink I opted for lower calorie light beers or spirits more often than not instead of calorie-dense lagers or stout.Do you need support to lose weight Everybody needs support when undertaking such a big change. Whether that be a personal trainer, or just a family member or close friend, Iaposd recommend you get someone on board to be there for support. In my case, I asked a close friend to act almost like my aposcoachapos to keep me honest. He would get in touch every now and then to see how I was getting on, was there to listenI had problems and cheer me on to my goals. Needless to say that educated professionals are much more qualied to play such a role, but having someone to bounce off and hold you accountable on the journey is essential.Did you almost give up Yeah, I came pretty close on November . I was making good progress in the weeks before but that morning I weighed in after a particularly tough week and had lost just one pound. In hindsight losing a pound in a week is a good achievement, but that week had been so dficult and the loss was a lot lower than I was expecting. I was agitated and questioning what I was doing for hours before I was convinced to take an hour to go on a short cycle to clear my mind. If I hadnapost walked out to get some headspace I wouldaposve broken and dialled back weeks of progress, especially since Iaposd already been fully committed to nearly a month. If youaposre about to give in - take a step back and remember why youaposre doing it.What do you doyou lose motivation Some days you just wake up and the same motivation you initially had just isnapost there - itaposll happen to everybody. Of course motivation is great, but it comes and goes. Behind the motivation you do need to have a certain amount of discipline. It can be very tough but you need discipline for when the inspiration and motivation just isnapost there. Weekly goals can help keep you focused.When did you start to see results The real goal wasnapost to get down to a certain weight or number, it was to feel good and take back some confidence that Iaposd probably lost. I started to notice a dference in how I looked around Christmas time , but had already felt better after about  days or so. I tipped the scales initially every week but increased that to twice weekly to avoid any discouraging fluctuations. Weighing yourself can be a good way of mapping out progress, but itaposs not the most important. If youaposre not getting the expected results one week, donapost get discouraged, itaposs important to make sure to keep doing the right things - the results will come.How important was exercise to your weight loss Quite important. I found a passion in cycling during my weight loss journey, but any form of exercise can give you similar results. Some people like running, walking, playing certain sports or of course the gym. It really doesnapost matter what your form of exercise is,you have a healthy and balanced diet then exercise is your best friend. Think of it as a complimentary relationship, the old saying of you cant out-exercise a bad diet can also be true for having a healthy diet but sitting on the couch all day. As little as a walk in the park, a short hike, leisurely bike ride or a dip in the sea can compliment whatever calories deficits youaposre creating and help you reach your goals faster. Butyou are taking on more rigorous exercise, itaposs important to ensure you arenapost creating too large of a deficit and are re-fuelling adequately.What are your golden rules for weight loss Everyone has their golden rules for weight loss, and although these particularly rules wonapost work for everyone, hereaposs a couple of mine: - Calorie deficit: If you create a daily calorie deficit, you will lose weight. Itaposs simple when you break it down like that. - Always treat yourself: Itaposs not about burning your bridges with certain foods, itaposs about improving your relationship with food. - Take your time: Thereaposs no rush, everyoneaposs bodies are dferent and once youaposre moving in the right direction thataposs all that matters. - Find your support network: Find someone to keep you on the right path and hold you accountable in the long run. - Exercise: Doesnapost matter what it is, get out there and get active. - Listen to your body: If youaposre hungry, eat something. If youaposre over-exercising, rest.Whataposs your advice to someone hoping to start their own journey If you were to take one thing from reading this, it would be my real golden rule. Sustainability. Whatever habits, calorie deficits or exercise regimes youaposre trying to put in place - you have to ask yourselfitaposs sustainable. When I set out to lose some weight, the one huge dference between all my failed attempts in the past was I asked myself is it sustainable  You should be trying to implementing a lestyle, not a aposlose weight quickapos hack. When you start on day one, ask yourself could you see yourself doing the same on day  or day   Because to lose weight and live a healthy and well balanced lestyle, whatever way you go about it needs be sustainable in the long term.

Tamas Dominko, , was caught out by the client who spotted the device as she went to get changed for the treatment - and turned it to face away from her before replacing it. After the treatment, she moved the phone again while dressing, then checked the screen to see it was still recording and had captured the massage. Ealing Magistrates’ Court heard the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, felt threatened after seeing the phone at a massage parlour in west London. She said in a statement she did not know how to deal with the discovery and spent the massage in fear there would be an altercation. Prosecutor Maya Arputham said: The defendant was in a massage centre as a contractor. He gets clients and they come in hourly for massages. This complainant comes in, she has been coming for three years and he has dealt with her before. On that day she realised something was very wrong. She sees a phone on a shelf, she turns the phone and undresses herself. She continued with the massage. Afterwards she looked at the phone and it was still recording and she was shocked. She took the phone from the shelf and went directly to the receptionist. In a statement, the victim said: It made me feel quite shocked and threatened through the appointment.

A study of , adults found that while only  percent consider themselves to be completely vegan,  percent would like to try animal-free products where possible. Of those,  percent are concerned about the environmental impact of using non-vegan items, while  percent worry about animal welfare. As a result, many look for plant-based alternatives for skincare , make-upand leather accessories . It also emerged that one in six are more willing to try vegan skincare products than plant-based milk - with the same percentage of people claiming cowsapos milk negatively effects their skin. These issues include dry skin , acneand puffiness .  But almost six in ten adults claim they don’t even know that vegan skincare exists - with the price , natural ingredientsand whether it is cruelty-free , among the top considerations when buying beauty products.Of those who do look for vegan skincare products,  percent do so as it’s good for the planet, while  percent prefer that animals are unharmed during the production. Nora Zukauskaite, spokeswoman for vegan skincare brand Skin Proud, which commissioned the study to mark its Cowfunding campaign this Veganuary, said: “The study shows how vegan alternatives are on the rise, but there are still some who are hesitant to make the change.“It’s sad to see so few people know how dairy cows fare when it comes to farming. “It can be both emotionally and physically harmful to the animals, as well as have a devastating impact on the environment. “At Skin Proud, we want to encourage people to incorporate more alternatives into their daily lives, from clothes to skincare, through simple and easy changes, and help with our simple and affordable vegan skincare products. “Interestingly, women are more likely to try alternatives to men, but this is still a good start in the right direction. “Our hope in  is that vegan options should become the first and only consumer choice for skincare and beauty products, to help with animal and environmental impacts.” The study also found one in five adults would be willing to switch to an alternative milk choicethey knew more about the health benefits.  But a fth have never tried anything other than cows’ milk - because they fear that plant-based alternatives may taste “weird”. And  percent havenapost tasted an alternative due to the price, according to the OnePoll study. Almost half of adults are unaware of the impact of dairy farming on cows - but of the  percent who are, more than half said knowing this makes them more inclined to try dairy-free milk alternatives. Nora Zukauskaite added: “We are committed to being vegan and cruelty-free, and are PETA certied. “We are working to help save the cows in the UK and US, with our Cowfunding campaign to protect cows and their rights in the UK and US, with a portion of sales from our products across Veganuary being donated to the Animal Equality charity who help reduce the suffering of animals.” Skin Proud’s Cowfunding campaign will see them donate  percent of online profits across January to help reduce the suffering of animals in the UK and US. *Skin Proud is available from Boots, both in store and online.

An inquest into the deaths of Garry Bolton and his daughter Paige, , was concluded on Monday with assistant coroner Ian Sprakes delivering a narrative verdict, Hull Live reports. He said: “On January , , Garry Bolton and Paige Bolton died at  Wensley Avenue in Hull between approximately .am and am due to the effects of inhalation of products of combustion and carbon monoxide poisoning due to the effects of a smouldering fire probably deliberately started that morning.” Garry and Paige died in the fire in the early hours of January , , at the house in north Hull, where they lived. But Paige’s mum Cherie Rangeley says the conclusion has left her with few answers and she believes a more definitive short form conclusion should have been delivered. She said she feels numb and like she has no closure. “For Paige it wasn’t suicide, Garry murdered my little girl,” she said. “There is no closure really. He didn’t have to take my little girl. If you want to kill yourself then fine but he didn’t have to take Paige. “I feel numb and didn’t really get the answers I was hoping for. I’m not any nearer where I feel I’m supposed to be. “I would have preferred a conclusion of suicide for Garry and unlawful killing for Paige rather than a narrative verdict. “But with Garry’s family there too I guess he has to see it from both sides.”  Cherie, who was with Garry for  years, also feels there was little said about Paige at the inquest. She said: “There was nothing really about Paige and how she felt. At the end of the day Garry took his own le and that of Paige which he had no right or need to do. “Paige was cheeky but also shy. But once she got to know you there was no shutting her up. “I loved her so much and loved buying her things.”  Cherie says Paige was quite a complex character but knew how much her family loved her. “Paige loved to play and we would go to a nearby basketball court and she would roller skate,” she said. “She loved being silly around me and we had a lot of fun. “But she was also delicate and could get very scared. I’m sure she knew what was going on that night and I dread to think what she went through. “But she knew how much she was loved. She rarely said she loved me but she would show it in other ways. “I just miss Paige being Paige and being able to hold her. I also miss her beautul smile.”  Cherie says it is still very hard and she struggles still every day. “Christmas was hard,” she said. “I started thinking I need to buy Paige a present and then realised she was gone. The inquest previously heard how Garry and Cherie had twins Paige and Ethan in  through IVF treatment. Sadly, Ethan died of a heart defect aged just six months, which devastated Garry and Cherie. Paige’s ashes have now been laid beside Ethan which makes Cherie’s visits to the graveside even more dficult. “I find it very hard visiting the grave as Paige really looked after Ethan’s headstone,” Cherie said “She would clean it every time we went there and would leave toys for Ethan. “Now she is not there to do it but, instead, lies next to Ethan. Paige was killed by her dad Garry in a murder-suicide in which he set fire to their home and locked them both inside, the coroner concluded on Monday. Mr Sprakes said he believed Garry Bolton had probably deliberately started the fire, with no logical explanation for the fire having been started accidentally.  Fire crews had to break into the property using a saw and then discovered the two victims lying together in the bathtub. Garry had locked the front door and made access inside dficult, the inquest heard, and no attempt had been made to contact the emergency services. Returning a narrative conclusion to the inquest, which started back in August, Mr Sprakes also referenced chilling texts sent by Paige to her grandmother before she died saying: Daddy is scaring me. Mr Bolton had also written a note expressing self-harm, the inquest heard. During proceedings in August, Mr Sprakes mentioned text messages Garry had sent to former partner Cherie, which he decided not to read out, which he said “amounted to a suicide note”. The inquest had heard how Garry’s mental health seemed to have deteriorated, having already suffered from anxiety, low self-esteem and paranoia.  Independent fire investigator Dr Will Hutchinson carried out an investigation into the blaze and he had also given evidence to the inquest. He had said it was a smouldering fire which meant it took a number of hours to develop. He also indicated such a fire would produce lethal levels of carbon monoxide almost immediately, which could take effect in a matter of minutes. The smoke alarm was also not working, but he could not say for sure whether the fire had been caused accidentally or deliberately. However, Humberside Fire and Rescue Service station manager Richard Gibson believed the cause was deliberate. He said: “I believe the ignition was due to an unspecied naked flame. “As the seat of the fire was in the centre of the bed, it leads me to believe it was deliberate.” Mr Sprakes delivered a narrative verdict. He said: “On January , , Garry Bolton and Paige Bolton died at  Wensley Avenue in Hull between approximately .am and am due to the effects of inhalation of products of combustion and carbon monoxide poisoning due to the effects of a smouldering fire probably deliberately started that morning.” Mr Sprakes went on to offer his condolences to Paige’s mum and the sister and mother of Garry who were all in court. He said: “I express my sincere condolences to the families of Garry and Paige Bolton. “This is a very sad and, indeed, tragic event. There are very few words I can say to relieve the pain and anguish for a truly tragic event.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON MurderMental healthInquests\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Samantha Stevens. , has relapse remitting MS, an incurable neurological condition which involves the immune system attacking nerves in the brain and spinal cord. She was first diagnosed with the lelong disease in  when her daughter was just a year old, Liverpool Echo reports. The ailment - which causes tiredness, vision problems and issues with balance or walking - manested in Samanthaaposs case with blindness whenever her core temperature rose too high.She would lose her eyesight completely in one eye whenever she took a hot shower and during hot summer days.Have your say on Samanthaaposs story in the comment section Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, she said: My daughter was a year old and I just lost sight in one of my eyes, I think MS can quite often present with visual disturbances. My auntie struggled with MS for a long time and she got to the point where she lost mobility in her arms and legs and I saw that growing up, so my first thought was aposoh no am I going to end up bed riddenapos as many with the condition do. I had an MRI scan and a lumbar puncture to confirm my diagnosis, thereaposs a lot of invisible symptomsI have a hot shower, I lose my eyesight, in the summeritaposs too warm, I lose my eyesight. I am fortunate that when my core temperature goes back to normal I do regain my sight. The Multiple Sclerosis society estimates that there are over , people with MS in the UK, and that nearly  people are newly diagnosed each year. Samantha, from Newton-le-Willows, now cares for her two daughters on her own, despite her condition progressing further requiring her to use a walking stick. She said: A lot of the time, with the relapses, you will have a problem and your immune system will sort of repair itself, but now that Iaposm in the progressive stage of my disease, there isnapost any repair now. I have extra aids at home, extra rails and equipment in the bathroom to help me with my showers and that sort of thing. The mum-of-two believes her devastating condition has strengthened her relationship with her two daughters aged  and . She said: There are small things like struggling to fill in a form when my kids bring them home from school because I struggle to hold a pen. My kids actually help quite a lot with cooking, and lting pans from the cooker to the sink and so on. Theyaposve almost taken on sort of a careraposs role which is rubbish because you hope your children will have as much as a childhood as they can. My older daughter understands the disease and its effect and she definitely worries, but Iaposd say it affects our relationship positively because I think they have a lot of admiration for me and what I have to do without the help of her their dad. He left when things got bad to have a better le without the burden of me I suppose, so it is just me and the girls.  Samantha is on a waiting list for NHS treatment but believes her best hope is to travel abroad and receive experimental stem cell treatment, that she claims to have up to a % success rate in treating her condition.She said: It is a risky and potentially dangerous procedure but I really don’t have many options. If there’s even a small chance that my disease progression can be stopped I’m willing to take the risk.Samantha is raising money to help fund her trip for treatment, you can donate via her GoFundMe page.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSImmune systemMultiple sclerosisDisabilityParenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Longstaffe is the writers middle nameMiners strike in  Image: Daily RecordopinionByPaul Routledge:,  Jan | commentsIt was something of a mystery why I was attracted to the cause of the miners. True, the National Union of Mineworkers was never out of the headlines in the Seventies and Eighties when I was Labour Editor of The Times. But that didn’t quite explain why I felt at home with them. Now I learn that it’s been in my blood for nigh on  years. The  Census shows my forebear Joseph Routledge, born in Durham in , was a miner, living in Shinclfe and married to Alice, nee Longstaff. Longstaffe is my middle name. I don’t know where the “e” came from.  Joseph and his family became Mormons and for a time he emigrated to Salt Lake City in the USA before ing, disillusioned, to his native county. Joseph went back into mining, studied hard and gained a manager’s certicate and was in charge of Ryhope colliery, Sunderland, for at least  years. Joseph was also the co-inventor of a safety lamp for use underground, and must have been quite well thought-of despite being the boss, credited with trying to keep the miners happy. He died in , and his widow, Alice,  years later. They are both commemorated in a stained-glass window in St Paul’s Church, Ryhope. Remarkable. I was dimly aware of these facts before, in relation to a novel by the Sunderland writer Glenda Craig. But I am indebted to the Routledge Clan Society, of which I am now a member, and its newsletter, The Blackmail, for the full story. No, I don’t know why they call it that – something  to find out.

The shocking video, which also includes frequent bad language, was shown to year  pupils as part of the religious studies syllabus at Excel Academy, in Sneyd Green, Stoke-on-Trent. It was included as part of a lesson on religious symbols last week and showed two cartoon figures discussing the Taoist aposyin and yangapos symbol and what the best and worst things in the world they could imagine were. One character thinks of a cheese toastie as the best thing in the world and a sex toy covered in razor blades as a depiction of something evil. The school says the Youtube video was shown by a substitute teacher, who had used the wrong video link. It says the video was identied as being inappropriate when played and wonapost be used again. But pupil River Maddocks told Stoke-on-Trent Live the teacher had told the class the video contained offensive language before it was shown.The first swear word appears on-screen at  seconds and an image of Jesus Christ reading Playboy magazine appears at  seconds. At  seconds, the F-word is spoken. The sex toy imagery is not until more than two-and-a-half minutes into the four-minute-long video. River, , who is a Christian, said he was shocked by the content and scribbled down the name of the film so he could tell his mum and dad.  His parents, Leah and Eden Maddocks, of Smallthorne, were horried when they watched the video for themselves. Leah, aged , said: When River first told us about it we thought he must be exaggerating, but when we watched it, it was even worse than we thought. Whoever decided to show that in a lesson must not have watched it properly beforehand. Itaposs not just the bad language or the fact it is offensive to every faith going - there is a part with a cartoon depiction of something which they shouldnapost even know about at their age. When we watched it we were mortied. I donapost think it is suitable to be shown to any age group in a school. Posted to YouTube by the Sam OaposNella Academy, the expletive-ridden film is called Where Religious Symbols Come From ­- That Happened Thursday and features stickmen characters giving an explanation of where the symbols adopted by ious world religions originate. River said he was astonished to be shown the video during a lesson. He said: We were revising for an RE test and doing religious symbols. The teacher, who isnapost our normal teacher, said he had a video to show uswe needed help with it. I was shocked when I saw it. All the other kids were laughing. Itaposs really not appropriate for a school.  Riveraposs dad Eden, , added: As soon as he mentioned it I was fuming, but when we sat and watched it, it was even worse than I thought. The world is going bananasthat can be shown in a school. An Alpha Academies Trust spokesperson said: A supply teacher used an incorrect video link which was identied as being inappropriate when played and will not be used again. More stringent checks will be made moving forward to ensure this does not happen again.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Jesus of NazarethYouTubeEducationSchoolsToysSex toys\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Joanne Freeman, , had contracted coronavirus two weeks earlier which had likely caused blood clots leading to the le-threatening medical condition when blood is cut off from the brain.She arrived at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardf at noon last Thursday but was moved to three dferent ambulances as paramedics finished their sht.The pensioner was screaming in agony and her hands were over her eyes when her family called for an ambulance around .am, a close relative said, reports Wales Online. She was saying her head was absolutely killing her. She lives by herself but has a carer who comes in four times a day who told us she was very distressed, they explained.Have you faced similar delays at hospital  Let us know at webnews@mirror Attempts were made to give Mrs Freeman paracetamol and other medication but she couldnapost take them or open her eyes. Mrs Freeman was eventually given an IV drip and her family reached the hospital but had to wait outside in the ambulance. The family member said she felt sorry for the paramedics as they changed shts, with one allegedly revealing there were  standing calls but none could be attended to as all ambulances were in use. They said there were a total of  waiting outside the hospital with patients inside. Mrs Freeman was allegedly still being given paracetamol once sheaposd been admitted and the relativeaposs brother-in-law had to raise his voice to get things sorted and a scan arranged, they claimed.  He had to ask them to put fresh bedding on and change the dressing on her back - nothing was given, we had to prompt them, they continued. At midnight -  hours after Mrs Freeman was first struck ill - her family was finally told sheaposd suffered a stroke and at am she was moved to a specialist ward. Referring to the stroke likely stemming from blood clots caused by Covid, the relative said: We had been waiting for her booster for ages but as itaposs a home visit she needs, there is a delay. Mrs Freeman caught Covid from one of her carers and came out of isolation on December . Her relative said: Itaposs just diabolical in there. I felt like I was in a third world country. You wouldnapost treat a dog like that. They were saying she needs to drink water yet ignoring that she couldnapost even hold a cup up.  We had to ask them for a drip. I know itaposs because they are understaffed because of Covid so lack a lot of staff and resources but to think Joanne was treated as an urgent patient but still didnapost get seen for  hours is crazy. What baffles me is how she kept saying how much pain she was in and was having a stroke but she wasnapost seen for that amount of time. If it was a -year-old person, would they be treated in the same way  Or is it because thereaposs not space at the hospital  Itaposs just ludicrous. I feel like I was leaving her le in danger by leaving her in their care. It never used to be like that.  A spokesperson for Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: “We sincerely apologise for the delays and experience Joanne has received during this time. Health and social care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are experiencing signicant and sustained pressures which is leading to delays in care provision and the timely discharge of patients from hospital.This, in turn, is impacting on patient flow within our hospital and waiting times in our Emergency Unit. Our focus remains on patient care and our staff are working tirelessly to see patients in a timely manner dependent on their healthcare needs.While we are under these extreme pressures, we would ask the public thatthey donapost have a le-threatening emergency to please call CAV   on     so we can assess and direct patients appropriately. ”Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ParacetamolHospitalsMental healthCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And his dad Prince William revealed that activity was carrying out litter picking sessions, which left his son frustrated about the state of the planet. Speaking to a BBC podcast last year, William ulged: So George at school recently has been doing litter picking and I didnapost realise but talking to him the other day he was already showing that he was getting a bit confused and a bit sort of annoyed by the fact they went out litter picking one day and then the very next day they did the same route, same time and pretty much all the same litter they picked up back again.And I think that for him he was trying to understand how and where it all came from. He couldnapost understand, heaposs like, aposwell, we cleaned this. Why has it not gone away ’  Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. William has been very vocal in the past  months about turning the tide on climate change and environmental problems.And heaposs previously said that he was concerned that George and his generation might still be talking about climate change in decades to come.  He added: But it shouldnapost be that thereaposs a third-generation now coming along having to ramp it up even more. And you know, for me, it would be an absolute disasterGeorge is sat here talking to you or your successor, you know in like  years time, whatever, still saying the same thing, because by then we will be too late.  It is thought that George and Charlotteaposs younger brother Prince Louis will join them at the same school in September after he turns four in April.As part of William and Kateaposs wishes to give them as normal an upbringing as possible, as soon as they walk through the school gates their kids are treated like any other child.And this means they must do what teachers tell them and follow the schoolaposs most important rule - just like everyone . Its website states: As you would expect of any Thomasaposs school, the most important school rule is aposBe Kindapos.

Ex-royal cook Darren McGrady says HM prefers to flavour the game meat with cranberries rather than relish or secret sauce but never has it sandwiched between a bread bun. Instead, she eats it naked on the plate.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here  Speaking to Insider last year, Mr McGrady said: “It always tickled me at Balmoral, we would make our own burgers. They would shoot deer, and we would do venison burgers.“There’d be gorgeous cranberry…stuffed into them, but we never set buns out. He went on to say: Her Majestyaposs Victorian upbringing dictates that the only thing you would pick up and eat with your fingers is afternoon tea. They would have burgers, but not the buns. So they would eat it with their kne and fork. The Queen holidays at the Balmoral estate in Scotland almost every August or September - last year for the first time in decades without Prince Philip, following his death in April.Mr McGrady worked as head chef at Buckingham Palace from  until , making food for Prince William and Harry, as well as Princess Diana. He also said the monarch hates pizza and during his time in her service, not a single pizza was ever served.  When he wasnapost prepping venison patties, the top chef was usually cooking up traditional French foods, he added.

Millions of Brits have made taking the tests part of their everyday lives to help prevent the spread of Covid infections. Dr Nathan, a doctor in London, says some people are testing themselves incorrectly and may be inadvertently going out while positive for the virus. He says the three most common mistakes are failing to spot positives, not reading the instructions and mixing up the best way to conduct the test, Manchester Evening News reports. Dr Nathan said: “Any positive line within  minutes, evenit is so faint that it is barely visible, equals a positive result, he said. “However,a faint line appears after  minutes, this can be ignored.” He added: “Don’t forget to avoid eating or drinking for at least  minutes before, to blow your nose and to wash your hands!”  “You should always follow the enclosed instructions, he continued. “If the test advises doing a throat and nose swab, do this. If it advises a nose swab only, do this. “That being said, there are some anecdotal reports of people getting a positive throat swab and a negative nose swab, and later developing symptoms and a positive PCR.”Dr Nathan who shares advice about Covid on his Instagram, @expedition_doctor. It comes as a new rule change is set to come into effect tomorrow, as the government works on keeping on top of coronavirus case numbers.There have been dficulties keeping track of case numbers in recent weeks due to shortages of lateral flow testsand polymerase chain reactiontests.Despite this, case numbers have remained high and have reached record levels since the Omicron iant took a hold on the country.  The UKaposs official Covid death toll passed , on Saturday January . Currently, people who test positive for Covid with no symptoms on a lateral flow test are required to take a PCR to confirm their status. This will change from January . They will still have to isolate for at least seven days, but only from the date of their positive lateral flow test.

Critics condemned the three-month arrangement with  health care firms which is intended to offer cancer surgery and urgent care to NHS truststhey are overwhelmed by Covid cases.Experts, campaigners and trade unions believe the new deal, backed by undisclosed amounts of taxpayers’ cash, will line multinational firms’ pockets and care for very few NHS patients.They say private hospitals can only take on extra patients by poaching medics from the NHS, which needs , more staff.At least  NHS trusts stretched to the limits have declared critical incidents in recent days.  In the first year of the pandemic, NHS England signed contracts worth more than £billion with private hospital firms. Yet they delivered less than .% of the nation’s Covid care and took on fewer NHS patients than the year before, said the Centre for Health and the Public Interest think tank. Campaigner Dr John Lister, of Keep Our NHS Public, said the new deal showed ministers and NHS England had learned nothing from the sums wasted on unused private capacity in . The health policy academic said: “Private hospitals can only take on additional NHS patients by poaching additional staff trained, and employed, by the NHS.” He said: “Tory ministers now prefer to squander more millions on short-term stop-gap deals with profit-seeking private hospitals than invest in reopening the ­thousands of NHS beds.”  Cat Hobbs, of campaign group We Own It, said decades of under funding has stretched the NHS to its limit and this is now an excuse to hand out more private contracts. “Not only does this open the door to further privatisation of our NHS, it’s also a huge waste of public money.” But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the agreement showed the collaboration across our health care services to create an extra safeguard that ensures people can continue to get the care they need.The UK has one of the fewest hospital beds-per-head of ­population of almost any developed nation. NHS England said more than , NHS day cases, almost . million surgical procedures and more than , diagnostic tests were carried out in the private sector in the past year.  The UK recorded , more confirmed Covid cases today and  more deaths.Weekly Covid hospitalisations are up % in the North East but in London, where Omicron first took off, hospital admissions in  are now down about a fth.NHS England chief operating officer Sir David Sloman said the new deal “means as many people as possible can continue to get the care they need”.

There will also be a north-south ide with temperatures hovering around zero and dropping as low as -C on Tuesday morning, while milder temperatures and rain is predicted for the south west of England. Met Office forecaster Alex Deaking said:In Scotland and Northern Ireland there’s a hint of blue on the charts and so certainly in rural areas and hills there will be pockets of frost. Most towns and cities just about staying above but we are in the colder air here further south with the cloud and the rain we are a long way from freezing with town in the south west perhaps staying in double digits.  Monday was a washout for much of the country with plenty of rain but Tuesday should be brighter and then the mercury will drop again in the evening. Temperatures will tumble on Tuesday evening so again that blue hue on the charts suggesting frost before midnight in the Midlands, South Wales and further south will see a frost developing and some fog patches which could be slow to clear on Wednesday, said Mr Deakin. More clouds across the North West and the Highlands but for most Wednesday is a fine winters day with some sparkling sunshine and light winds. Start with a frost but by the afternoon temperatures ticking up to about the average of C or C.  There was a warning though that it could be a lot colderthe fog doesnapost lt. “Butfog sticks then it will be dficult for the temperatures to get much above freezing,” added Mr Deakin.The weather pattern is expected to continue next week with typical frost for the time of the year.  The Met Office stated: A continuation of largely settled conditions is most likely as we head into the middle of January with high pressure remaining in charge across the south of the country. Most areas are set to be dry with any spells of rain and stronger winds likely to be restricted to northern parts of the country. The settled weather will bring widespread overnight frost as well as fog patches, these sometimes freezing. UK forecast for the next  days Today: Blustery showers in west and north Scotland, slowly easing. Rain, drizzle and low cloud across southern areas, where it will be mild. However sunnier skies in central parts of the UK should follow to all but some southern counties later. Tonight: Windy across northern Scotland, with patchy rain and fairly mild. Elsewhere dry, patchy cloud in some central and western parts but clear where with frost and patchy rural fog. Wednesday: Southern and central areas mostly sunny with light winds, after any fog clears, temperatures mostly near average before frost and fog s after dark. Northern Scotland, windy with patchy rain. Outlook for Thursday to Saturday: Settled but colder in the south with fog and low cloud becoming more widespread and stubborn to clear. Milder further north with rain and stronger winds at first.

We will issue no further statements and will not entertain any questions out of respect.”  His health had been failing for some time.Late last year he was placed on a ventilator after testing positive for COVID-. He had also battled bladder cancer. Durst was sentenced to le in prison in October for the execution-style killing of his longtime confidant Susan Berman, and soon after he was indicted for the  murder of his we, Kathleen Durst. The New York native was born into one of New York’s wealthiest families but became best known over the disappearance of his we and the murders of his best friend. Durst, whose family have owned a series of New York skyscrapers, including an investment in the World Trade Centre, was investigated after a recording of him confessing was used in the  HBO documentary series The Jinx.During filming, he said into a hot mic, “killed them all, of course.”He was serving a seven-year sentence on a firearms charge as he was arrested and tried for Berman’s murder.

But one man has found himself experiencing both ends of the spectrum after the Covid- pandemic took him from embracing his unique name to being the butt of endless jokes. Kovid Kapoor, from Bangalore, Karnataka, India, always thought his name was special - until early  when he realised he now shares his name with a virus that has caused a global health crisis. The -year-old trip agency owner said: It is crazy how I am getting all this attention for my name.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Before the pandemic, Iaposve always thought it was a unique name. I have met just one another Kovid in college and we instantly connected because I never found anyone with the same name. Kovidaposs name was chosen by his mum after she saw it in a religious hymn and the word - which is spelt with a soft aposdapos - means scholar in Hindi. And although the pandemic has made him second guess his love for his name, Kovid says heaposs embracing the hilarity of the situation as best he can.  He added: I was amused when the WHO first announced Covid in . Friends and relatives started sharing the reports with me. It was surprising at first. For three months straight, my name was on TV every day although with a slight spelling dference. It felt great. My mother was equally amused. But as the pandemic spread, Kovid found that more people began to think he was lying about his name - or that heaposd changed it for a joke. In one hilarious instance, Kovidaposs friends ordered a personalised cake for his th birthday last year, but after thinking the message was a joke, the baker changed his name to aposCovidapos. The man has also had baristas in coffee shops stare at him bemused when he gives them his name and has been laughed at by security officials. He said: People really find it amusing, they think I am joking or have changed the name. I have changed my Twitter bio to aposmy name is Kovid and I am not a virus.apos Kovid is making the best out of the awkward situation though and hopes the increased interest in his name will help bring more traffic to the trip agency that he owns.

From a classic Big Mac to the new vegan McPlant, thereaposs something for all of us. And itaposs hard to argue that their salty golden French Fries arenapost better than other chains - although, of course, that is subject to personal choice. One McDonaldaposs worker went viral after releasing a video showing how he treats rude customers who demand fresh fries.Deandre Byars, who claims to work at the fast-food restaurant, told viewers to stop being rude to staff in a now-viral TikTok video on the , where heaposs known as @dresav.In the clip, he jokily revealed what happens when you demand fresh fries at McDonaldaposs.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.

Since being posted, the video has racked up more than , likes and thousands of comments from ided viewers.

Another joked: “Then you have to remake them because we all know they’re not fresh and complain, so you’re really playing yourself. A third person said reheating the fries is unsafe because the salt ruins the oil. But surprisingly, the majority of people didnapost seem to care as long as their chips were warm. Lol thataposs fine as long as theyaposre hot, one said.  Another added: Literally as long as they arenapost cold, tough or soggy [I donapost care]. If that fixes it then Iaposm cool with it. While someone  advised: Always ask for fries with no salt and they will a hundred per cent be fresh! Bring your own salt!

Doctors said she was healthy and avoided frostbite despite the intense cold. The baby was in a cardboard box designed to store eggs and had been left to freeze to death, say police. Law enforcement are now seeking the baby’s parents and announced an investigation into the attempted murder of the child. “We were just out for a walk in the evening, when we saw a box,” said Renat. “We walked closer and heard a squeaking sound. We thought there were puppies inside the box. “But when we turned our phone torches on to see what was inside, there was a tiny baby - a girl. “She was lying there like a little doll, so tiny. “We were so stunned we didn’t even know for some seconds what to do, and where to run. “She had no clothes on her, she was wrapped in a piece of fabric, with a bottle next to her.” The lads tried to flag down a car - but no one stopped.  So Renat called his father saying: “Dad, we found a baby girl in the box.” “I rushed to them with my we, and took the baby to the hospital,” said Dmitry, . We were all shocked. The doctors had a careful look and said she was fine, not even frostbitten.  “My son and his friends must have picked her up just in time.” Medics say the baby - two or three days old - was probably born at home, then abandoned by the mother. Rinat’s mother Anna said: “We are parents to three sons, so having a daughter was our long-term dream.

Take care of her for me.” Kevin and Joe’s owner admitted that they were “bawling” making the video, and urged people in their comments to “cherish every single day with your fur baby.”  Thousands of TikTok users were moved by the emotional video, with owners sharing their tragic experiences of losing their own beloved dogs. “I know how much you miss him,” one person commented. “My Maxy, same story and a chocolate [Labrador]. I can think of him now without crying, sometimes.”“Our animals ’ hearts can go on living longer than their bodies,” another said. “I miss all mine watching over me.”Others acknowledged the bittersweet experience of getting a new puppy after losing a dog. “This made me cry so hard,” a third person admitted. “I’m in this same boat. Just got a new baby after losing my previous one back in June.” “We lost our boy in March to lymphoma,” another added. “And he just sent us a new boy who needs extra TLC.” Kevin and Joe aren’t the only dogs who have left TikTok viewers in tears lately. More than three million people were moved by an uplting video of Rottweiler Pluto, which showed how it might look to have your dog greet you in the afterle. Captioned: “You arrive in heaven, this is how your best friend greets you,” the emotional clip shows Pluto bounding through a field towards the camera in slow motion, a happy grin on his face. “I instantly started sobbing watching this and thinking about that day,” one person commented on the tear-jerking video. “Tears in my eyes - I really hope this is true,” another added.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"district news january 7 2022","story":"Tiny Glenbarr Primary School, which has just six pupils, has just missed out on being named Scotland#s most scenic school.More than , votes were cast in a Twitter contest organised by Henry Hepburn, news editor at education resource magazine and website Tes Scotland, to highlight the stunning locations of Scotland#s schools.The competition attracted  schools and celebrities even got involved, re-Tweeting posts to boost votes during the few days of competition in December.Despite having so few students, Glenbarr reached the nail-biting semi-final, just short of the final.With views overlooking Ben Nevis, Lochaber High School won in the end, narrowly beating Morgan Academy in Dundee.MID ARGYLLVolunteers are needed to help provide and expand PCR testing in several locations across the NHS Highland region, including Tarbert and Lochgilphead.Volunteers will be co-ordinated by the British Red Cross.

This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet. There were no incidents of breach of the peace, assaults and so on.All was peaceful on Islay too.No public houses or hotel bars were open to the public on New Year#s Day, which undoubtedly helped to keep everything quiet.There was one New Year#s Day incident. A van belonging to the Redfusion television company struck a wall on Low Askomill. Nobody was hurt.The breathalyser appears to have retained its purpose.All the burgh#s taxis were kept going non-stop over the Christmas and New Year period and operators reported heavy bookings.The West Coast coaches were also well used by people who sensibly left the car at home.Shops were kept busy during the few festive days and licensed grocers sold big amounts of the #cratur# and other alcoholic drinks.Christmas and New Year Day babies expected at Craigard Maternity Hospital failed to arrive and the staff had a quiet time of it.A large crowd of people of all denominations and from all over the country converged on Carradale House, home of the authoress Mrs Naomi Mitchison, to take part in the New Year celebrations.This was the rd time that Mrs Mitchison had played host to a large number of guests at Carradale.Politicians, government workers, farmers and fishermen all mingled together, danced, sung and sampled an excellent buffet.Many Carradale villagers were also present.Addressing the guests, Mrs Mitchison talked about the effects of the Common Market and fishermen.

This original fragment is now in the National Museum of Scotland but its discovery suggested something very signicant about Aberlady’s early history.The design on the fragment was similar to the artwork of the Lindisfarne Gospels, an illuminated manuscript made on Holy Island and completed around AD. This Gospel book is a priceless national treasure, probably created by Eadfrith, the Bishop of Lindisfarne.Ian has a passion for history, especially early Medieval history in the time before Scotland, and so the cross fragment had always fascinated him. The dimensions of the cross fragment suggested that, before it was broken, it would have stood about five metres tall.“A large cross with this level of ornate carving would only be commissioned and erected at a place of some importance,” he told me.“The Celtic Church was widening and deepening its influence and its leaders now had the ear of kings. Royal endowments of land and wealth to the Church and rewards to loyal and battle-hardened thanes co-existed. This was very much a time of devout holy men and warlords. It was such an exciting piece of evidence of Aberlady’s early history.”Ian explained that a cross of similar date and style at Abercorn in West Lothian was very probably carved by the same person, or team of masons, and gave an idea of what the rest of the cross at Aberlady might have looked like. Intriguingly, there were three fragments of that cross.When he told me this, my thoughts wandered for a moment. Here we were, having a wee drink in a pub, talking about a craftsman, or group of craftsmen, whose skill and creativity has been preserved for well over a thousand years, and yet we know nothing about them, not even their names. I raised a glass to them and the countless thousands of skilled stonemasons, joiners, builders and artists of all kinds who really did build our historic monuments, but whom history almost never credits.But, I thought, at least we know who made the beautul recreation: Barry Grove, who also carved the reconstruction of the Pictish cross-slab at Hilton of Cadboll – and he used the same simple tools and techniques that would have been used by those earlier stone masons. The cross was unveiled in Aberlady’s Memorial Garden on December , .Ian then told me of the lost ecclesiastical settlement of Pefferham. He explained that there was a medieval document called Historia Regum, meaning History of the Kings. It was written in the th century and is usually credited to Symeon of Durham. This document listed all the main churches of existence in the Northumbrian diocese of St Cuthbert during the ninth and th centuries AD. Aberlady would have been part of this diocese.“Each of the important churches of the diocese, including Melrose, Abercorn, Edinburgh, Auldhame and Tyninghame, are identied in a clockwise direction in the Historia Regum,” Ian explained. “But there is one church mentioned in that document that is lost in time and seems to have vanished from both maps and memories. It was known as Pefferham, seemingly east of Edinburgh and west of Auldhame.”The western branch of the Peffer Burn flows into Aberlady, of course, and place-name evidence places the village on a route taken by monks travelling between the two great seats of learning of the Celtic Church at this time: Iona and Lindisfarne on Holy Island.This route became a holy highway connecting the two major religious sites, and one very likely taken by St Aidan, who left Iona to establish the church on Lindisfarne. In this context, a high cross here at Aberlady, or Pefferhamyou prefer, becomes quite plausible.More evidence emerged from metal finds in the Glebe Field immediately north of the present church. The tip of an ornately carved bishop’s crosier and a carved representation of Madonna and child had been found by metal detectorists lots of coins too. Moreover, geophysical research located two seemingly overlapping oblong structures, which could have been Anglo-Saxon but perhaps over large when compared with others. The evidence was cumulating and convinced Ian of the need for archaeological research. Historic Environment Scotland agreed and Historical Monument Consent was given, and a case for funding was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund.The project envisaged involving six local schools, as well as many local and not-so-local volunteers, and the funding was approved. The archaeological investigation in the Glebe Field, just north of the church, took place in .The results of the dig were astounding, revealing a signicant settlement of stone structures overlaying earlier timber structures dating to the seventh to th centuries. The largest collection of scattered metal objects dating from the Anglo-Saxon period ever discovered in Scotland came from the Glebe here, pointing firmly to a major settlement during that time.Ian happily told me that “prominent academic research experts have agreed that there is now sufficient artefactual, place-name and textual evidence to say that we can begin to tell the story of the ‘lost’ Anglo-Saxon settlement of Pefferham”. “In fact,” he added, “it seems that base hole for the original carved cross may have been discovered.”It was so fascinating to hear and there is not enough space here to go into all the details of the story, but fascinating leaflets have been produced by the conservation and history society which bring these exciting discoveries to le. But nothing compares to a visit to the village to view the locations and feel the presence of all this history, with brilliantly illustrated information and interpretative  by the society to guide your imagination.What has been achieved by Aberlady Conservation and History Society was summed up by Ruth Parsons, chief executive of Historic Environment Scotland, who has said: “The incredible work done by Aberlady Conservation and History Society has brought previously unknown history to light. It has added to our understanding of a period in history little understood, even by those who know most about it… this fabulous cross reconstruction is, quite simply, unique. Hopefully, it will stand for centuries.”I hope so too."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-new-housing-development-tranent-revealed","story":"Members of the public can learn about Persimmon Homes East Scotland’s plans for land between Lammermoor Terrace and the industrial units off Elphinstone Road on Wednesday.The developer is yet to reveal how many new homes or what size the properties would be on the site, which is currently farmland.A spokesperson for Persimmon Homes East Scotland said: “Persimmon Homes will host an online interactive consultation event on Thursday, January , between pm and pm.“Members of the public are invited to post questions on the proposals and a member of our team will be online to answer.”A formal application would need to be submitted to East Lothian Council following the public consultation.Members of the public would be given another chance to look at the plans and make any comment before they are potentially scrutinised by the council’s planning committee.Mike Falconer, chairman of Tranent and Elphinstone Community Council, encouraged any interested parties to attend the virtual consultation and find out more about the proposals.

How, then, did it go for Raworth Before we could find out, politics show watchers began the day, as is traditional, with Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday. Having started his run last May as a maternity cover for Sophy Ridge, Phillips was the future once . Now he is the longest serving presenter in post.His first interview of  was with Nadhim Zahawi, former Vaccines Minister now Education Secretary for England and, for this day only, Minister for the Sunday shows.Mr Zahawi had already set the direction of the day with a Sunday Times interview in which he said it would be “helpful”the quarantine period could be cut from seven days to five.He also, according to the report, said free lateral flow tests were on the way out. In front of the cameras, though, he said that was not the case. Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had already called the move to scrap free tests “utterly wrongheaded”.: Warning on free testsPhillips’s running order also included João Vale de Almeida, the EU’s ambassador to the UK, on Northern Ireland and trade the First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, on dferences in Covid restrictions around the UK and Marvin Rees, mayor of Bristol, on the Colston statue verdict. It was a newsy mix that made for a lively hour.Sunday Morning had Mr Zahawi and Rachel Reeves, Shadow Chancellor, as well as an interview with a hospital chief executive. In keeping with Marr show tradition there was an arts segment, this one featuring Elizabeth McGovern, aka Cora Crawley of Downton Abbey fame, and her new play about fellow actor, Ava Gardner. The show’s other regular, the newspaper review, had also survived intact, as had the set.Sunday Morning was similar to Marr while at the same time very dferent. Where Marr’s show was fleet of foot and proactive, Sunday Morning had the air of a programme that was put together last Tuesday and not changed since. Where Marr set out to make headlines, Sunday Morning came across asit wanted to have no impact at all.In short, Sunday Morning, like its title, felt safe, bland, BBC.Fair enough, butthe Raworth shows prove popular with audiences, and BBC management, it could influence the selection of the new host.Comparing Marr and Sunday Morning has little to do with the presenters personally. Both are experienced, highly respected journalists. But broadly speaking they represent dferent styles and approaches to the jobRaworth, for example, is BBC through and through, cool, calm, hard to read. In recent years it has seemed as though she was getting ready to take on a Dimbleby role with a place at great state occasions.: Covid, the latest figuresMarr, in contrast, with a hinterland in newspapers before joining the BBC, is more of a scrapper whose interview style could best be described as robust. He left the BBC precisely because he wanted to express a view and shake things up.Which style do viewers prefer  It is a question being asked not just at the BBC but throughout the industry as a whole. GB News thought it had the answer by hiring “big personalities”, only to find viewers cared just as much,not more, about basic standards. The signing of Piers Morgan to talkTV shows which way Rupert Murdoch sees the wind blowing.Alternatively, having had a taste of news and views mixing to a greater extent than before, UK audiences could be ready toto the more traditional fare offered by the main channels.Despite the dull title, Sunday Morning might prove to be a lively arrival after all."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-scotland-without-covid-funding-london","story":"“Our public health response is curtailed by lack of finance” she said last month, after the UK government added another £m of new money for Covid response. It doesn’t matter how much Westminster gives Holyrood – it will never be enough.What the Covid crisis shows is how much better Scotland is as part of the Union rather than separated from the world’s fth largest economy, with no central bank, no currency, no national grid, and with a government that wants to shut down North Sea gas and oil.From the rapid and unique development of the Astra Zeneca vaccine, free from the constraints of the European Medical Agency, through the support of the British Army, the roll-out of millions of free lateral flow tests , to the sharing and pooling of medical science across the four nations, the case for the Union speaks for itself.William Loneskie, Lauder.TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR THE SNPNICOLA Sturgeon’s stance on lateral flow test kits being freely available betrays the core problem with SNP policies: great on the surface, huge problems underneath. Health minister Humza Yousaf is in the same boat .Lateral flow kits are expensive and, like all “free items” on the NHS, prone to abuse. Add in John Swinney’s exhortation to basically use one every time you go out, and not only does the bill rise alarmingly, so does the mountain of plastic waste.Mr Yousaf is not taking into account the damage to commerce nor staff availability nor even the mental health of many Scots.Ms Sturgeon effectively cancelled the holiday period for many and did huge collateral damage to the economy. The SNP is one-dimensional, focussing only on theof time until indyref, but there are three “normal” dimensions plus time and space.The government isn’t coping with the breadth or height of the problems it is facing, and time is running out for the SNP as is space for the endless excuses as to why little is working properly in Scotland today.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL THOSE TEST KITS WHILE fully supporting the ongoing current pandemic injection campaign and the regime for frequent use of lateral flow tests, I cannot help but feel a gnawing and growing unease about the veritable mountain of many millions of single-use pieces of plastic we are creating, destined for landfill, this being anathema to the Greens among us.I also wonderany attempt is being made to reclaim and recycle the tonnes of, presumably high-grade stainless steel, from the teeming multitude of used syringe needles David J O’Hara, Scotstoun, Glasgow.THE UK MEDIA’S HARMFUL VIEW OF THE EUDAVID Leask’s article on “Scotland’s skin-deep relationship with the EU”highlights some crucial issues, not least the Scots’ affection but lack of detailed knowledge about the signicance of EU membership.That “we are not remotely interested in its detail” is in part true. That Scots “…do not keep up with what is happening in the EU or in its member states…and neither do our politicians” has been deeply concerning, but no surprise.Why might this be  During our tenure as members of the EU, the UK media largely ignored the wide-ranging signicance of our membership, unless an ‘EU bad’ headline was lazily accessible.I was always struck through my involvement with other member states how their national and, more importantly, regional press regularly featured balanced pieces on a new piece of legislation, new consultation, speeches or visits by Commissioners or delegations.By contrast, it was evident that large sections of the UK press indulged in clear campaigns of misinformation which at times verged on the ludicrous. The EU would fairly regularly send measured rebuttals to editors across the UK, but I cannot recall ever seeing these being published.Sometimes the detail doesn’t matter and sometimes it does. Our collective poor record in informing the public did however play a large part in the dreadful and internationally embarrassing decision to withdraw from the EU, the consequences of which we have not even started to realise, as David Leask observes. Our attachment to Europe is perhaps more at an emotional level and sometimes that is more than enough.Tony Fitzpatrick, Dumfries.A RISK INHERENT IN THE ASSISTED DYING BILLEILEEN McCartinmakes an excellent point about the dangers of the ‘slippery slope’ associated with legalising assisted suicide or euthanasia, as evidenced from the experiences of other countries where laws have been extended to include disabled people, children and those with mental illnesses.She states that many Liberal Democrats oppose Liam McArthur’s proposals but she is incorrect in claiming that “the current Assisted Dying Bill … in no way reflects Lib Dem policy”. Sadly, the Scottish Liberal Democrats did adopt just such a policy in , which was reaffirmed in  by the UK Liberal Democrats in a motion which made specic reference to Mr McArthur’s proposed Bill.Of course, like all previous attempts to legalise assisted suicide, Mr McArthur has failed to address the concerns that exist about how to safeguard those who are vulnerable to pressure being exerted by others with questionable motives, such as access to a potential inheritance or the desire to free up beds in hospitals or care homes.For example, most of those gaining assistance from doctors to commit suicide in Oregon now regularly cite the “fear of being a burden on family, friends or caregivers” as their reason for seeking death.The bill would provide a cheap solution for policy-makers or NHS managers, enabling them to sidestep their obligations to address the unmet need for palliative care. It would make the situation worse.The experience of those countries which have gone down the assisted suicide or euthanasia route shows that the development of palliative care is impeded when such legislation is in place.Faced with shortages of NHS resources, an overstretched workforce due to the pandemic and the prospect of huge savings to be made by enabling patients to end their lives prematurely, can we really trust politicians to come up with a law containing adequate safeguards which will prevent abuses from occurring Dr Gordon Macdonald, CEO, Care Not Killing, Glasgow.THE ABORTION CONUNDRUMI HAVE never understood why abortion has not been brought in to the discussion about assisted dying.It is perfectly legal to end a le that has not been lived , whereas people who have lived what they describe as a happy and full le and now wish to end it, either because of, or ahead of, intolerable, unmanageable pain, are unable to make this decision for themselves.Why is it permissible to end one unlived le but not another fully lived le Kathleen Gorrie, Helensburgh.NOT ALL SUFFERING CAN BE RELIEVEDI AM a retired doctor, and a Catholic opposed to assisted dying legislation.Like Lilian McDade , I have watched my -year-old son die. I have witnessed the suffering of patients, of their family and friends, and also within my own family. I don’t believe we can relieve all suffering, either physical or mental.However, I dfer from your previous correspondents. As a doctor, I felt my role was to relieve suffering where I could and to acknowledge and respect the patient and her family when I was unable to provide relief. As a doctor and a person, it was not my role to end her le, only to be present.Some of us have charmed lives and happy deaths, but some have dficult lives and dficult deaths.I believe a caring society acknowledges this and acts to help. Offering death, however, is not acceptable to doctors, nurses or human beings.We ought to oppose assisted dying legislation.Miriam Deeny McKernan, Rutherglen. "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13365327.jpg?type=article-full","title":"royal-mail-release-special-stamps-celebrating-rolling-stones---buy","story":"The band celebrates its th anniversary this year, having been formed in London in  and the  stamps will pay tribute tot the band.Eight of the stamps will feature images from some of their most famous performances over the years, including dates such as ’s London Hyde Park show held on July , just two days after the death of founding member Brian Jones.The free outdoor festival, marketed as The Stones In The Park, saw the live debut of his replacement guitarist, Mick Taylor, who was later replaced by Ronnie Wood.Other performances to feature on the eight stamps include those from Rotterdam, Netherlands, in August  and their gig at the Knebworth Festival in August .A further four stamps will be available in a miniature sheet format and will feature two shots of the band together and two of their vintage worldwide tour posters.The Rolling Stones – Sir Mick Jagger, Ronnie Wood and Keith Richards – worked closely with Royal Mail on the issue of the stamps, which also feature drummer Charlie Watts, who died in August last year.They are only the fourth music group to feature in a dedicated stamp issue, Royal Mail said, following The Beatles in , Pink Floyd in  and Queen in .\" alt\"HeraldScotland: The Rolling Stones are only the fourth music group to feature in a dedicated stamp issue. \" class\"editor-image\"The Rolling Stones are only the fourth music group to feature in a dedicated stamp issue.David Gold, Royal Mail’s director of public affairs and policy, said: “Few bands in the history of rock have managed to carve out a career as rich and expansive as that of the Rolling Stones.“They have created some of modern music’s most iconic and inspirational albums, with ground-breaking live performances to match.”The stamps go on sale from January  and can be ordered from today on the Royal Mail website."},{"url":null,"title":"andy-murray-steps-australian-open-preparations-win-viktor-durasovic","story":"Murray required just  minutes to sink the world number  and bounce back from his disappointing loss to Facundo Bagnis in Melbourne to win - -.The former world number one has accepted a wild card for the Australian Open, three years after intimating he may have played his last game due to impending hip surgery.Murray said in his on-court interview: “It is really nice to get my range and hopefully I can carry that through to Melbourne.“I was hoping to get matches in Melbourne last week, but that didn’t happen.

The rest of the six were Starling, HSBC and the The Co-Operative Bank.The research found that TSB, Bank of Scotland owners Lloyds, , Nationwide, Santander and The Co-operative Bank also all still use SMS texts to very a log in, leaving messages \"at risk of being hijacked by cybercriminals\". Santander and The Co-operative Bank said they are looking to move away from SMS.They also found that TSB, Virgin Money and Nationwide were failing to use software that ensures spoof messages sent by potential scammers are blocked or quarantined by your email provider. TSB has said it has since introduced this protection, Virgin Money said it was in the works and Nationwide said it operates ‘a range of email security controls’ to protect members.HSBC came out on top for securitiy, with a score of  per cent. It was the only bank to score five stars for both website encryption and account management. It was rated A+ for cipher strength because it supports the latest encryption standards.In a test of each provider’s banking app Virgin Money and TSB again were were amongst the lowest ranked.Lloyds, Nationwide, Santander, and TSB dropped points because online and mobile banking require the same login credentials - with the consumer organisation saying it would prefer banks to ask for app-specic passcodes.Which said: \"While online banking is a largely safe way to manage money, scammers are upping their game and the industry needs to keep pace.\"That is why we are calling for banks to work much harder to upgrade online security so they are providing high levels of protection for customers.\"If a fraudster does breach a bank’s defences and you lost money as a result, you have a legal right to a refund from your bank – unless it can demonstrate that you were ‘grossly negligent’ – in other words, unusually careless with your security details.\"Last year TSB was reported to the finance regulator for failing to comply with the rules over online banking security .Concerns were raised with the Financial Conduct Authorityabout Edinburgh-based TSBs online banking login process as it joined Edinburgh-based Tesco Bank as the worst in the UK in a probe into flaws in online banking security that could help criminals to scam customers.Jenny Ross, Which money editor said: “Banks must lead the battle against fraud, yet our security tests have revealed worrying flaws when it comes to keeping people safe from the threat of having their account compromised.“Our research reinforces the need for banks to up their game on tackling fraud by using the latest protections for their websites and not allowing customers to set insecure passwords. We also want banks to stop sending sensitive data to customers via SMS texts as this could leave the door open to fraudsters.”A TSB spokesman said: “We continue to invest in strengthening online and mobile protection for customers and have introduced a number of features recently which aren’t captured in these results. Additionally, TSB tracks well across the industry on fraud with lower than average fraud losses. In contrast to the wider industry, we are the only bank that offers a guarantee to refund our customers should they ever fall victim to bank fraud.”A Virgin Money spokesperson said: “The safety and security of our banking services is our top priority and we are continually monitoring, assessing and improving our security controls.”A Lloyds Banking Group spokesman said: “Keeping our customers’ money and data safe is our priority and we have robust, multi-layered security across online and mobile banking services to protect against cyber security threats. We employ world-class experts in the cyber-security field, who work to deliver the right balance of online security measures, customer experience and accessibility. We continuously evolve and invest in our safeguards and have fully decommissioned the legacy Lloyds Bank sub-domain referenced.”A NatWest Group spokesman added: “Security continues to be a high priority for NatWest Group to keep our customers and the bank safe. We continue to invest in our digital security capabilities, leveraging market leading technologies – for example, multi-factor authentication and our work on biometrics – to deliver simple and secure banking services for our customers.”"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12837729.jpg?type=article-full","title":"tenerife-raises-covid-alert-level-including-rule-six","story":"As reported by the Evening Standard the popular holiday destination upgraded its alert level to “very high risk” after a surge in Covid cases.These new measures came into effect yesterday , and include the rule of six now applying to social gatherings indoors and outdoors, unless they are living in the same household.Covid passes will also be required for entry into places like bars, restaurants and other establishments, with owners being responsible for checking these.Additionally, curfews are now in place, so bars and restaurants will have to shut down at midnight.\" alt\"HeraldScotland: British travellers will have to face new Covid restrictionstravelling to Tenere \" class\"editor-image\"British travellers will have to face new Covid restrictionstravelling to TenereThese restrictions are expected to be in place until January , after which they will be reviewed.Officials raised the alert level on the island after health data showed rising rises which was increasing pressure on local hospitals.As reported by the Evening Standard, a further , positive infections were reported across the Canary Islands on Sunday .Alongside that nine further deaths were recorded, with six being in Tenere."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : amRoad works are to be carried out at the Castle Street car park in Kirkwall, near to the entrance off Junction Roadthis Thursday, January .

It comes, however, only after millions in public funds have been spent on an ill-conceived vanity project opposed across parties and the communities most directly affected.#No-one disputes the need to modernise air traffic services, which support operations on our leline air routes. Sadly, months and millions have been wasted by SNP Ministers and HIAL on a centralisation that was never going to get off the ground.”Meanwhile, Alistair Carmichael MP said that the “costly and unnecessary” plans have ended “not with a bang but a whimper”, and called for reform of the board of HIAL to ensure the communities that the airport operator serves are heard.“Above all we need to reflect on how this sorry state of affairs came to be in the first place,” said Mr Carmichael.“Retreat on the centralisation plan is only a temporary fix of the underlying problem. HIAL is supposed to be accountable and responsive to the needs of the entire Highlands and Islands and it is clearly not living up to that aspiration.“If we are to avoid another similar fiasco in the future then we need to look at further reform to ensure that our communities are heard on the board of HIAL.”Richard Hardy, Prospect National Secretary, welcomed the announcement and said that the union and HIAL remain in “sensitive negotiations” in relation to the future delivery of air traffic services.A HIAL spokesperson said: “We have been clear that ATMS is the best option to maintain the long-term sustainability of air services for the Highlands and Islands. Nevertheless, we are committed to working with Prospect and our air traffic control colleagues to try and develop a new solution involving compromise by both sides.“We would encourage those with an interest in ensuring the delivery of a safe, resilient, and sustainable air traffic operation for island communities to recognise the delicate nature of these negotiations and engage in constructive dialogue to reach that end.” copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is challenging health systems and service delivery in many countries where Omicron has spread and threatens to overwhelm in many more.”Dr Kluge added: “The key message is that every inidual should do everything possible not to get infected in the first place.”Asked about whether Covid- is moving to an “endemic” stage, Dr Catherine Smallwood, senior emergency officer at the WHO Regional Office for Europe, said: “In terms of endemicity we’re still a way off.“Endemicity assumes that there is some stable circulation of the virus at predictable levels and potentially known and predictable waves of epidemic transmission.“But what we’re seeing at the moment, coming into , is nowhere near that – we still have a huge amount of uncertainty, we still have a virus that’s evolving quite quickly and posing quite new challenges.“So we’re certainly not to the point of being able to call it endemic.“It may become endemic in due course, but pinning that down to  is a little bit dficult at this stage.”The Region saw over  million newly reported cases of COVID- in the first week of , more than doubling over a two-week period.As of th January,  countries report that over % of their population is catching COVID- each week @hans_kluge— WHO EuropeJanuary , She went on: “All of this, of course, depends on how we respond to it, and widespread vaccination uptake and on an equitable basis will be very, very key in moving towards such a scenario, and we’re still a way off that.“At the moment, the conditions for endemicity are not being met. The virus is not settling into a stable rate of transmission, and there’s still a lot of unpredictability… We hope to see that very soon rectied but it will very much depend on the actions we take collectively across Europe and across the world.”Meanwhile, Dr Smallwood suggested that Omicron is not milder than Delta.She told the briefing: “The reason we’re seeing a lot more milder infections across Western Europe and Israel is because of the high vaccination uptake in our population.“That immunity is basically meaning that we’re able to tolerate, from a public health perspective, a higher degree of infection in the population.“And, as much as we can tolerate that higher degree of infection in the population because of the vaccine coverage, we cannot necessarily tolerate the disruption that that’s bringing to our critical services.The overall risk related to Omicron remains very high:⃣ The global risk of #COVID remains very high overall⃣ Current data indicate that Omicron has a signicant growth advantage over Delta, leading to rapid spread in the communityhttps:t.co FkMbaAiB pic vmWZFLYCfQ— World Health Organization January , “We cannot predict the same milder resurgence of cases, and we’re yet to see how Omicron will pan out in a situation where there are more people susceptible and immunologically naive, and that’s where we need to hold our guns, be very cautious and not jump to any conclusions about changing the strategy and letting Covid spread – that would be a grave mistake.”On reports of a so-called Deltacron iant, she said: “ reports of a recombination between Delta and Omicron iants, and indeed we are in touch with Cyprus, who have been providing information about that.“And it does at this stage look like it could be the result of laboratory contamination rather than a new iant or new recombination between two iants.”Dr Kluge said WHO Europe advice encouraging people to take up an offer of a booster jab is not contrary to international WHO statements which have called for initial vaccinations to be prioritised over boosters.He added that lockdowns and mandatory vaccines should be “tools of the very last resort”.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The pitches have been very favourable to bowlers my whole career.“At my best I’ve obviously shown something the England selectors have enjoyed, so I got picked with an average of . That is less than normal but there aren’t too many openers averaging a lot more than that at the moment.“I think - is a very good average for an opener these days and that’s something that’s very dferent from  years ago.” vw,vw,px, px\"Zak Crawley helped England avoid defeat in the fourth Ashes Test Crawley’s words are sure to raise a few objections, from groundstaffnobody  but, in an environment where administrators are asking serious questions about the ability of the domestic game to produce international quality players, they could find a sympathetic audience.“Obviously I’d like the pitch at Canterbury to be a little bit better – I don’t think it’s unfair of me to say – but I don’t think it’s just a Kent thing,” he said.“I think pretty much all the grounds I’ve played on have been pretty poor. I can think of about two or three where I’ve got to them thinking ‘this is a really good wicket’.“So, it’d be tough for me to find somewhere maybe a bit flatter. I think it’s more a country-wide problem and I think it will help our Test team a lotpitches did start getting better.”Crawley, who has cemented his place in the team for the fth Ashes Test in Hobart this week, also revealed how watching footage of his career-best double century against Pakistan helped see him through a dramatic drop in form last year.The Kent batter looked set for stardom when he scored a sensational  at the Ageas Bowl in August , the th highest Test score by a England player in history.But rather than ride the crest of that wave, Crawley sunk. In  he batted  times for his country and made  runs at an ego-bruising average of ..His dashing  last time out was good enough for Australia great Ian Chappell to tip him as “the future of England” but Crawley admitted there have been times where he has needed to bolster his own self-belief. vw,vw,px, px\"Zak Crawley scored a Test double century against Pakistan in  “I would have said the  was a springboard for me and , it certainly wasn’t,” he said.“I watch that innings frequently when I’m going through bad form, to be honest, because it is a nice reminder that I’ve done it before and I can do it again.“Sometimesyou are feeling a bit rough, you can lose sight of the fact that you can play and it’s always nice to remind yourself.“I played really nicely that day but I feel like I’m a better player now and that’s because of the failures I had last year. It was all a great learning curve.“You tend to learn more from your failures than your successes actually and it wasn’t the year I wanted. But I learned a lot about myself and my game and I feel like I can push on from it and become a better player.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year.

It was the adventure of a letime. I was made to fee part of the team, sailing this magnicent ship, straight away, the permanent crew at our sides – and we couldn’t have done it without them. They guided us in all aspects of the running of the ship with care and kindness.“Watching everyone working together as a team really moved me. I wanted to let everyone know, whether disabled or non-disabled,you’ve lost confidence in le or fearful of being with people, this is where you need to be. Part of the team on Tenacious. She was built especially for this purpose to give new le and to find out just how able you really are.“I#ll never forget my voyage and the wonderful friends I made and so overwhelmed at how challenges were overcome. Thank you Tenacious and thank you to the magnicent permanent crew who led and guided us all the way.”Patrick Fleming, JST’s chief executive, said: “Tenacious is the only tall ship designed to be sailed by a mixed ability crew – allowing fellow voyage crew members to join in with the day-to-day activities on board.“It’s great to hear stories from people like Mavis who’s lives have been truly touched by the experiences offered onboard.”The JST charity offers people of all abilities the opportunity to climb aboard their tall ship Tenacious for an immersive sailing experience and relies on funding from the public. Since its founding in , the Jubilee Sailing Trust has welcomed more than , people on board."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BOOK-LUKE-EVELING-4-scaled.jpg","title":"school pupils face massive social loss due to","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine of the worrying experiences he had witnessed among contemporaries during two years of the pandemic.And the pleas were echoed by the education chair of Highland Council, who urged the UK and Scottish Governments to make the wellbeing of school pupils a priority in the year ahead.Skye Councillor John Finlayson’s comments came after a record number of more than , cases of Covid- recorded across Scotland just a few days before schools ed in the region.The council’s education chair said Highland Council was committed to getting young people back to school and believed there should be a big push for –-year-olds to receive the Covid- vaccines.Expanding on the matter of how coronavirus had impacted education, the former head teacher said he believed that the pandemic had acutely affected the social and mental wellbeing of youngsters..“We have lived through two years that are completely dferent to any period in education we have ever seen.“While the impact on the academia side of things has been a real concern, the other side effects relating to mental health and wellbeing, socialisation, developing and sustaining relationships are also crucial.“The curriculum in its broadest sense is everything that happens in a school. So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1641481177735.jpg--covid_19___thu_6th_january_figures.jpg?1641481178000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220106newscovid 19 thu 6th january figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

vaccination centres are very convenient for many people and are generally open seven days a week for most of the day.“They have played an absolutely vital role in getting jabs in arms. They work best as high volume hubs, when demand is at its peak.“If these big centres suit you best, now is the best time to go - either for a walk-in jab or by making an appointment.“The centres still have a role, but it will be scaled back in a number of locations, as we spread capacity out more widely across Northern Ireland. That will include reduced opening hours and days of operation in some of the big centres.”She added: “Experience tells us that localised clinics are very effective at reaching people who do not come forward straightaway.“Trusts are therefore starting to sht resources towards local and mobile clinics. These will include locations where take-up for boosters has been lower, and also in high footfall settings such as shopping centres.“While there will be more clinics, they will generally only be available at a particular location for a limited period of time.“Localised clinics are also very important in reaching people with accessibility issues and helping to provide equal access to boosters.“If you want to get your booster at a big centre which currently has plenty of available capacity, don’t delay any further.”To get instant information on Trust and pharmacy vaccination clinics closest to you, type in your postcode or town at this online location search https:vaccinations.covid-.hscni.net location-search.Most ReadCrime pays for loyalist killer Robert ‘Brooksy’ Clarke as he puts Co Antrim mansion on market for almost £m‘He was my brother, I loved him so much’: Funeral takes place of ‘beautul soul’ Aidan Mann stabbed in DownpatrickDick Strawbridge: buying dream home in France left us pennilessStephen Nolan victim of Twitter ‘pile on’ after being ly accused of hitting out at Novak DjokovicRepublican ex-inmates body run by former IRA man applied for NI centenary cashTop VideosPlayDownpatrick murder victim Aidan Mann laid to restPlayVideo: World#s most powerful telescope gets shock testing in Northern IrelandPlayThreats and abuse over Covid have taken toll on my family – NI Health MinisterLatest CoronavirusOmicron NI: symptoms update, testing, and what should I doI have to self-isolate UUP leader slams Jim Allister after Covid query asking what precautions in place to prevent ROI citizens availing of free testing kits from NICoronavirus Northern Ireland:  deaths and , cases as MLAs meet to discuss ongoing crisis in schoolsMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageChief Medical Officer issues fresh appeal for over-s to get boostedLatestCovid- ‘not yet endemic’ – WHOMSE founder to fund £, advice service for vulnerable energy customersOmicron NI: symptoms update, testing, and what should I doI have to self-isolate Zak Crawley suggests England’s batting woes partly down to ‘poor’ county pitchesRose Ayling-Ellis calls for British Sign Language to be made ‘official’ in UK,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

What we are seeing now is patients presenting with a sore or scratchy feeling throat, mild headache, sneezing and a runny nose.“We are not seeing as many people – either adults or children – experiencing high temperatures or fever. For the most case, these symptoms can be managed at home with a mix of paracetamol or ibuprofen, basically over-the-counter medicine you can get from a pharmacist.”Read MoreWhat does a faint line on lateral flow test mean The transmissibility of Omicron has prompted the government to change testing and isolation guidelines.As of January , people in Northern Ireland who get a positive lateral flow test no longer need a PCR test to confirm that result.In the event of a positive lateral flow test, the public has been advised to assume they have Covid and that you are infectious and report it on the gov.uk website.The earliest a period of self-isolation can end is on day seven - providing lateral flow tests on day six and seven are both negative and the inidual does not have a high temperature.Day six and day seven lateral flow tests should be at least  hours apart. If either is positive, isolation should continue until two negative lateral flow tests taken  hours apart are achieved, or after the inidual has completed  full days of isolation – whichever is earlier.Read MoreNI public advised to self-isolate after positive lateral flow test as confirmatory PCR no longer neededAnyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable and particularly immunocompromised, they should still get a polymerase chain reaction , also known as a laboratory test, even with a positive lateral flow test , to ensure that they are then offered the potential for additional treatment as soon as possible, in order to prevent more serious illness, Dr Stout explained.He continued: “For anyone who doesn’t have an underlying condition, what they need to look out for in terms of getting worse would be shortness of breath, a tight feeling in their chest where they are unable to draw a deep breath in.“Many people have also bought pulse-oximeters which measure the level of oxygen in the blood. They are maybe not as accurate as the ones in hospital butyou do have one and your reading drops below % then it might be time to think about getting further help.“We are still contacted by patients seeking help and reassurance when they test positive for Covid.

of the Government’s flagship tuition scheme, figures have revealed By Catherine Lough, PAJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailAround a quarter of catch-up tutoring courses for this academic year have been delivered by the provider of the Government’s flagship tuition scheme, figures reveal.Headteachers suggest schools are finding the system “confusing and dficult” to navigate.More than , tutoring courses began last term under the school-led tutoring route, but only , courses began under schemes coordinated by chosen provider Randstad, Department for Educationfigures show.Randstad, the company which was awarded the National Tutoring Programmecontract this year, has faced criticism for lacking the capacity or competence to deliver the scheme “effectively”.Last month, Nick Bent, chief executive of the Tutor Trust, one of the partners delivering tutoring in schools, told MPs that Randstad did not “have enough staff or the right expertise” and there were “problems” with the tuition hub.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said schools know their pupils’ learning needs ‘better than anyone’PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said schools know their pupils’ learning needs ‘better than anyone’The DfE has said it is working closely with Randstad to make sure numbers continue to rise and tutoring continues to reach the students who need it.Randstad is the supplier of the NTP – the flagship scheme for helping pupils to catch up with learning loss – this academic year after the £ million contract was awarded to the company in June.A separate school-led tutoring route was announced in June last year, with schools receiving £ million directly to employ their own catch-up tutors.The DfE has said it is “on track” to deliver their target of two million tuition courses this academic year, with , courses starting last term and an estimated , accessed through the school-led tutoring programme.An estimated , starts have been made by pupils on courses provided through the Tuition Partners’ scheme so far this academic year, while , starts have been made by pupils under the Academic Mentors’ scheme, both of which are coordinated by Randstad.The , starts represent only % of the company’s target of , sessions while the estimated , pupils supported through the Academic Mentor programme equates to less than % of the , target for  .Headteachers have said the figures for take-up of the programme under Randstad are “signicantly less impressive” than those for school-led routes,  and that schools report they find accessing support through the external partner route “confusing and dficult”.Karen Guthrie, programme director of the NTP at Randstad, is due to be questioned by MPs about the company’s performance in running the contract during a Commons’ Education Select Committee hearing on Wednesday.Randstad has been contacted for comment.Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that it was “pleasing” to see up to , pupils who had seen their education “badly disrupted” by the pandemic being offered one-to-one support.“Some of these young people will have so far only received a first session of tutoring but it is a positive start,” he said, adding that schools knew their pupils’ learning needs “better than anyone and will appreciate being able to stay in control of the tutoring support on offer”.But he added that in comparison, the “figures ed by the Government’s chosen tuition partner Randstad are signicantly less impressive and it comes as no surprise to learn that schools are opting to keep tuition in-house as opposed to outsourcing it”.Schools have told us that they find accessing tuition support through the National Tutoring Programme confusing and dficultNick Brook, NAHTMr Barton said ASCL had said schools were finding it dficult to place their trust “in an external provider” and that the Government’s decision “to use an expensive commercial partner has backfired”.“It should place its faith firmly in the teaching profession to repair the damage to education suffered by so many of our young people,” he said.Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “Schools have told us that they find accessing tuition support through the National Tutoring Programme confusing and dficult. The numbers for the national scheme are, without question, disappointingly low.”He said that the figures released on Tuesday showed that schools were “stepping forward to arrange their own tutoring support for pupils” using the “more flexible” school-led route in spite of issues with the national scheme.Given that funding had been made available in the autumn term and training for tutors had begun in November, he said schools had “done well to commence tuition for nearly a quarter of a million pupils”.“This shows real appetite for tutoring but that schools aren’t finding the national route accessible,” he said.“Unfortunately, the story behind these numbers is that there are still many children that would benefit from tutoring support who are not getting it. Too many schools report that there are simply no tutors available that meet their needs.“The Government’s tutoring revolution risks stalling unless more is done to ensure that high quality, easy-to-access tutoring support is available to every school, for all pupils that need it, in every single part of the country.”Schools Minister Robin Walker said: “We are now seeing the real reach and impact of the unprecedented investment this Government is making in supporting children’s education recovery.“Every pupil – wherever they live – should be supported to get back on track and reach their potential, and that’s what this tutoring programme is doing.“We know there is still work to do, but it’s hugely encouraging to see so many students from all backgrounds have been directly reached through the Government’s tutoring programme, and I encourage all schools to take advantage of it.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

Produced by the British Youth Music Theatre , “Breadboy – The Musical” is the sequel to Tony Macaulay’s acclaimed memoir, “Paperboy” which had two sell-out runs at Belfasts Lyric Theatre in  and . The Lyric will again be hosting Macaulay’s new production and a star from Derry could well steal the show. Derry has a rich history of acting talent with the likes of Amanda Burton, Bronagh Gallagher, Saoirse-Monica Jackson and Jamie-Lee ODonnell all having starred on stage and screen. Auditions will take place at St Cecilias College on February  – although it may be moved online in order to comply with Government Covid guidelines. BYMT Executive Producer, Jon Bromwich, said: “At BYMT we develop talent and grow creativity to the highest level, for our  summer season we are looking for fierce actors, singers and musicians. BYMT offers young performers the rare opportunity to gain experience in a professional environment before entering the industry as an adult.” The storyline of “Breadboy” picks up from where “Paperboy” left. It follows the le of -year-old Belfast teen Tony in  who is the bread delivery boy for the last Ormo Mini-Shop in the world. As well as dealing with a iety of customers on the Upper Shankill, he also stumbles across punk music, via Derrys own “The Undertones” and their famous hit, “Teenage Kicks” which in turn reflects his own feelings on his school-crush, Judy Carlton, who sits opposite him in chemistry class. Tony Macaulay, writer of Breadboy, said: “Everyone involved in the musical adaptation for Paperboy were overwhelmed by the reception it received over the past two years. It was such a privilege to be part of this amazing project. The entire creative team especially the young cast were phenomenal. “I am delighted that BYMT has decided to bring Breadboy to stage for their new season. I wish all those taking part in the auditions the very best of luck and look forward to meeting and working with the young cast in .” Singer-songwriter Duke Special added: “I am delighted to be involved in the next adventures of Tony Macaulay as Paperboy transforms into Breadboy. Tony’s mind, as a  year old growing up in s Belfast, is a glorious mix of reality, imagination and downright fantasy! His muses may be the same as his slightly younger, paperboy self but this time he’s older, wiser and wearing Brut.

Produced by the British Youth Music Theatre , “Breadboy – The Musical” is the sequel to Tony Macaulay’s acclaimed memoir, “Paperboy” which had two sell-out runs at Belfasts Lyric Theatre in  and . The Lyric will again be hosting Macaulay’s new production and a star from Derry could well steal the show. Derry has a rich history of acting talent with the likes of Amanda Burton, Bronagh Gallagher, Saoirse-Monica Jackson and Jamie-Lee ODonnell all having starred on stage and screen. Auditions will take place at St Cecilias College on February  – although it may be moved online in order to comply with Government Covid guidelines. BYMT Executive Producer, Jon Bromwich, said: “At BYMT we develop talent and grow creativity to the highest level, for our  summer season we are looking for fierce actors, singers and musicians. BYMT offers young performers the rare opportunity to gain experience in a professional environment before entering the industry as an adult.” The storyline of “Breadboy” picks up from where “Paperboy” left. It follows the le of -year-old Belfast teen Tony in  who is the bread delivery boy for the last Ormo Mini-Shop in the world. As well as dealing with a iety of customers on the Upper Shankill, he also stumbles across punk music, via Derrys own “The Undertones” and their famous hit, “Teenage Kicks” which in turn reflects his own feelings on his school-crush, Judy Carlton, who sits opposite him in chemistry class. Tony Macaulay, writer of Breadboy, said: “Everyone involved in the musical adaptation for Paperboy were overwhelmed by the reception it received over the past two years. It was such a privilege to be part of this amazing project. The entire creative team especially the young cast were phenomenal. “I am delighted that BYMT has decided to bring Breadboy to stage for their new season. I wish all those taking part in the auditions the very best of luck and look forward to meeting and working with the young cast in .” Singer-songwriter Duke Special added: “I am delighted to be involved in the next adventures of Tony Macaulay as Paperboy transforms into Breadboy. Tony’s mind, as a  year old growing up in s Belfast, is a glorious mix of reality, imagination and downright fantasy! His muses may be the same as his slightly younger, paperboy self but this time he’s older, wiser and wearing Brut.

But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Covid cases across the country have continued to rise with , cases reported from December  to January . Of this, over  were in Derry as Derry remains the county with the highest Covid infection rate in Northern Ireland. Schools across the city resumed face to face teaching in the classroom earlier this week after the Christmas break, with no change to Covid guidance. Susan Parlour, President of National Education UnionNI, said: The message seems to be, keep the schools open and hope for the best, its farcical. There is no PPE in schools and there are no risk assessments. I understand this takes time but it is essential in the current circumstances. Face coverings are required in schools which staff need to provide themselves or they need to accept the substandard masks offered which are really not fit for purpose. Also, many children do not wear their masks and this is rarely challenged. We receive daily figures on Covid cases in schools but with no track and trace in place and lateral flow testing, which has proved time and time again to not be the most reliable, the number of cases and close contacts will be higher than what is recorded. Chief Medical Officer, Dr McBride, stated that Covid was not spreading in schools and that outside socialising was the cause, we saw the rise in cases over Christmas and the schools were shut. Mark Browne, Permanent Secretary, sent a letter to principals on December  that stated that the departments advice onmeasures to reduce transmission has not changed. He stated that EA has provided CO monitors to schools along with detailed instructions on their use. This is not the case. CO monitors are not on the ground and there is little to no guidance on how to use them. NEU NI released a statement providing guidance for CO monitors and their use stating that carbon dioxide monitors are not a solution to the problem of poor ventilation. The Department for Education in Englandis rolling out a very limited number of CO units and most schools will not be able to benefit from this scheme. Susan continued: Schools, students and principals feel let down and there are no mitigations in place to keep them safe. There seems to be a  perception that teachers want to teach from home, it is not the case. Teachers want to be in the classroom but they want it to be safe for both them and their students. There are no measures in place to keep the school community safe, no close contacts, no track and trace, no support and no meaningful guidance. NEU NI are currently advising teachers and schools not to teachover  per cent of their staff are absent. If this number of absent staff members is reached, the school should close. The Education Minister stated that options are available such as consolidating classes or teachers teaching remotely as well as live teaching but Susan explained, this is even more work and pressure on teachers, in an already stressful teaching environment. At St Cecelias College in Derry, % of the staff are currently off sick six teachers and  classroom assistants. There are  pupils who are off sick in one class alone. Tanya Wakeley, teacher and union rep at St CeceliasCollege in Derry, said: We are teaching in a Covid stew, it is a nightmare and it is not good enough. Those are the numbers only two days into the school year and we havent even reached the peak of this Omicron wave. The government has to do something and we need to speak up. We dont want to work from home, its not an efficient way to teach and its double the workload. We want to be in the classroom to teach our pupils, but we want to be doing it safely, where both staff and pupils feel safe. We know for a fact that schools arent safe at the minute and we can see that after only two days back teaching. The students feel let down too, especially the senior years. They dont even knowtheyll be sitting their exams in the summer. Nobody knows what is going on and there is no clear direction. I have students that have never sat an official exam and that will no doubt never get their work experience. We feel very in the dark with everything and we are not being told enough. With teacher absences, many teachers are forced to form compositeclasses or teach larger numbers of pupils than they are used to or is usually advised. Tanya continued: A class can have anything between  to  pupils and what we have to do at the minute, because we dont have enough teachers in school, is put more than one class in the multi-purpose hall. The pupils are all socially distanced, but Covid is airborne, and there are no windows in that hall. If we are in the classroom, the classrooms are freezing because we have to ventilate the rooms, its the middle of January, with the cold air we are going to get sick either way, whether its Covid or not. We are not provided with sufficient PPE, the masks are not fit for purposeand at this stage, it is a complete trust situation that pupils do not come inthey have tested positive or have Covid symptoms. The parents are worried as well and we dont even have the governments guidance to reassure them. We are being told one thing by the government and another thing by experts. You dont know what to believe and God knows what is coming next. This is not going away and its definitely not going away in schools. It is going to get worse before it gets better and we need plans in place. We are collateral damage and we have been forgotten about. Education Minister, Michelle McIlveen, has said her priority remains keeping schools open amid the surge of casesin Northern Ireland. She said there have been no changes to the guidance issued toschools regarding Covid because health officials havent changed their position. Schools experiencing staffing shortages will have the option to move to remote learning and introduce partial timetables, she added. A spokesperson for the Department of Educationsaid that “a range of mitigations” have been recommended to risk the transmission of Covid within schools across the North. They said: “Throughout the pandemic the Department has worked closely with key stakeholders as well as the Department of Health and Public Health Agency as we manage our response and continue to do so. “We continue to follow advice in relation to all public health issues including contact tracing however no changes have been recommended in respect of the approach to contact tracing or changes to the DE Covid guidance. “Rates of Covid infection in the community in Northern Ireland are currently extremely high. Schools are part of our community so it is inevitable that there will be cases among staff and students in our schools. “While we cannot eradicate Covid altogether, a range of mitigations are recommended to reduce the risk of transmission as much as possible in the school environment. “These measures include regular LFD testing, good hand respiratory hygiene, maximising ventilation, face coverings for post-primary pupils and staff and consistent groups wherever possible. “All staff and those aged  and over have also had access to the vaccination programme. We have a shared objective to support our schools so they are able to provide for our children as we all know that the best place for our children and young people is in school. “No one mitigation on its own will prevent the spread of the virus, but used together each mitigation provides works to reduce transmission. “Our schools, like those across the rest of the UK and Ireland, are facing staffing shortages due to the pandemic. There is a limited supply of qualied teachers. “We have made a formal call for retired teachers to provide support and we have also looked to provide more flexibility for schools in how they deploy substitute teachers. If further financial resources are needed by schools we will make bids to meet these costs. “The EA secured more than , C monitors and approximately  per cent of schools in NI have now been provided with monitors, with a further  monitors expected imminently. The additional monitors will be delivered to the remaining schools as a priority and also to those schools that have requested additional monitors. “Good ventilation, along with other measures can help mitigate the risk of transmission. Natural ventilation, such as opening windows can be effective at reducing the risk from virus in the air. “School leaders who are concerned about ventilation in a room should contact the EA maintenance helpline for advice and support on the best approach for their inidual circumstances. “In some cases where an area of poor ventilation has been identied, it may be appropriate to consider the use of an air cleaning unit as an additional mitigation whilst further remedial work is undertaken to improve ventilation. “The pandemic requires a collective response to support the safe operation of our schools – staff, parents, and pupils all have a key role to play carrying out regular testing and making sure making sure that anyone with symptoms follows Covid- advice and information which is available atNIDirect.gov.uk.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Hundreds of people turned out for the first day of vaccinations at the Centre, which played an important role in the initial drive to deliver First and Second vaccinations. The Foyle Arena is now open to walk-ins and bookings from am to pm, Monday to Saturday, and am to pm on Sundays. Mayor Warke joined them to receive his booster jab, and said he was impressed by the swt organisation of the effort and the professionalism of staff on site. He said: “This is a rapidly changing situation and I am extremely impressed at how these measures have been so quickly put in place to meet demand. I want to acknowledge the work of the Western Trust staff who are doing such an amazing job in very challenging circumstances. “I also want to thank all the staff at the Foyle Arena, and previously at Templemore, who are playing a vital role in this effort. “The Trust are aiming to vaccinate  people a day at the Foyle and I would appeal to everyone attending to please follow the advice of the professionals and lets do all we can to get as many people as possible protected in the weeks ahead.” The campaign is expected to continue until January and to safely accommodate the numbers of visitors to the centre Members of Foyle Arena, there will be some minor impacts to services over the coming weeks, though most will continue as normal. This includes changes to studio class timetables, and alternative temporary arrangements are now in place for Members, with a wide range of leisure services also available across other Council owned leisure Centres. Director of Health and Community with Council, Karen McFarland added: “There has been a speedy response to the recent developments in the Covid pandemic, and we were happy to be able to step up once again to provide much needed facilities to help progress the Trusts Vaccination Campaign. “Measures have been put in place to mitigate any impacts and while most of our leisure services will continue as normal, there may be some disruption to some activities which we will communicate directly to our members. “This is a short term campaign, and I really appreciate everyones patience as we assist in getting vaccinations to those who need them. “With high volumes of people expected to attend I would appeal to people to please follow the guidance at the centre and the directions of staff – they are there to help keep things running smoothly. “The safety of our staff and the public is our first priority and I would ask for everyones cooperation over the coming weeks.” With the volume of people accessing the Foyle Arena, additional parking is available for members at Clooney Park West playing fields. To find out more about leisure services available across all Council sites, and any changes to timetables please go to: derrystrabaneleisure The Western Trust this week issued an appeal to staff to help in the escalated operation as vaccinators. People are being encouraged to use the booking system as the number of walk-ins that can be accommodated will be limited. Vaccinations are also available from GP surgeries and local pharmacists. Over s who have yet to get their first dose of the vaccination can also receive it at the vaccination centres.

These proposals are being brought forward by a new partnership between Derry-based property developer South Bank Square and housing provider Choice. The new plans include a mix of social and affordable homes ranging from one to four bedrooms, comprising a mix of terrace, detached and semi-detached houses as well as a number of bungalows and apartments aimed at those aged  and over. Proposals also include signicant areas of open space, a woodland walk, allotments, childrens play area, and a tenant hub. The project represents poundmillion of investment to the City Region, and will see the creation of approximately  new jobs over a period of eight to  years. Martin Mallon, Managing Director of South Bank Square said: “We are delighted to unveil these updated proposals for the Ballyoan site. “This new partnership with Choice Housing Association represents a signicant multi-million pound investment in the North West and will see the development of hundreds of new family homes over the next ten years. “The comprehensive planned development of this site will be key to delivering some of the thousands of new family homes that we know are very much needed in the city now and over the forthcoming years. “The new proposals will include expansive areas of open space, children’s play areas, a woodland walk, as well as proposed improvements to the local roads infrastructure. “It is fantastic to be able to announce this level of investment in our home city and we expect that this scale of investment will bring with it many job opportunities for local people and local suppliers in the North West. “Enabling works have already started on site following our planning approvals granted earlier this year and we hope to commence house building on site early in .” Michael McDonnell, CEO at Choice added: “We are thrilled to move forward with these proposals in partnership with South Bank Square. This project will unlock huge potential to create much needed, high quality social and affordable homes for a range of people in the city. “As well as relieving housing stress in the city, this project will allow young families to get on the property ladder by bringing forward a number of affordable homes, as well as offering professionally managed, exceptional private rental opportunities too. “Extensive planning has been carried out to ensure the needs of young families, disabled people, and the elderly are catered for, with plenty of green space, allotments, a play park and a tenant hub included in our ambitious plans. “We hope to be able to secure planning permission for these homes so that we can begin to deliver them as soon as possible.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Invest NI and the Department for the Economy , believe that Northern Ireland’s ranking in the ONS survey is not truly reflective of the level of innovation activity that is actually being delivered across the region. This could be down to the fact that many businesses simply don’t recognise what they do as innovation.  In response to the ONS, DfE launched Innovate NI in October  this is an initiative that supports local businesses to progress through a four-step innovation framework for successful innovation to create value. The initiative also provides official recognition for innovation activity, helping businesses to understand where they are in their innovation journey and recognise their innovation achievement.  As a business further develops their innovative project, they can have their activities assessed by Innovate NI. If deemed to be innovative, they receive recognition so they can clearly see the level of progress that theyre making.  Mary agrees with the need to encourage businesses to identy as innovative.  “One thing is for sure we don’t shout about our innovation achievements enough. I firmly believe the NI economy is much more innovative than the ONS survey portrays during the pandemic, we found that NI actually had a lot of innovative businesses with erse offerings and locally we showed a high level of resilience in dealing with a very signicant economic shock. “But I do think micro-businesses in particular, sometimes struggle to see themselves as being innovative and struggle to understand all the supports that are available to them. That’s why Innovate NI’s recognition scheme is so important and it is one of the reasons we decided to support the work of Innovate NI with the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant.” Economic Recovery Innovation Grant The Economic Recovery Innovation Grantis funded by the Department for the Economy’s Economic Recovery Action Plan. The grant was launched on th November and it provides small-to-medium-sized businesses, including micro- businesseswith the opportunity to apply for a grant of up to pound,.  This grant was created to help businesses progress their innovative idea - this idea must be new to the business, or the market, for example, a new product or service, or a new process within the business. The grant will help a business that is currently working on an innovative project to test and develop it, with the end goal of commercialising the product or service, or implementing the process fully in the business. The pound, can be used to fund development costs and the actual implementation of that innovative idea into the business. Businesses hoping to apply must complete Invest NI’s eligibility checker and satisfy the scheme’s eligibility criteria including being registered with HMRC and being a Northern Ireland-based SME or social enterprise.  They must also have a valid Silver Level Innovator recognition from Innovate NI. Silver Level Innovator recognition means businesses have already started to test and develop an innovative idea for their business.  Businesses can checkthey satisfy the eligibility criteria on Investni andthey do, they can submit an innovation assessment to find out their innovation level. Once issued, Invest NI will invite the eligible, Silver Level Innovator to apply for ERIG. Mary says the reason why businesses must have the Silver Level Innovator recognition to qualy for the grant, is to ensure that the grant is put to good use.  “We want local businesses to further develop innovative projects, services or processes that will enable them to grow. A business that is recognised as Silver Level has already completed the ideation and selection steps of the Innovation Framework, so we know the grant will be used to progress an idea Innovate NI has assessed as potentially innovative. “Using the grant to achieve commercialisation or implementation would then, hopefully, allow a business to progress to Gold Level Innovator status.” Innovate NI also provides help, support and signposting to ensure businesses progress through these innovation levels. This helps to avoid repeating the same step over and over again. This signposting will also help businesses know where to go for the right help. “Innovation can be something big or something minor, but it can make a major change for an SME or micro business. Just go checkyou are eligible and where you are on the Innovation Framework - it could completely change the way you do business.” The closing date to apply for the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant is pm on Monday, st January . Grants will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.

Neighbouring Fermanagh  Omagh had the second-highest rate of . while the lowest figure was to be found at Ards  North Down with .. The overall rate for the North stands at . cases per . people. While there are suggestions that another full-scale lockdown may be imposed by the Executive, given that the new Omicron iant of Covid has long-since embedded itself within the island of Ireland, no matter what restrictions are put in place, Dr Black – who is the Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council – said that rates will continue to rise over the next few weeks. He said: “It doesnt matter what restrictions we put in now because the effects of the fth wave, which is Omicron, are already baked into the system. What is going to happen over the next few weeks cannot be altered now. “ the horse has bolted. That ship has sailed. We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks. “This will include another two weeks of a huge infection rate, two or three weeks after that will be hospitalisations – hopefully not in large numbers and not too much pressure on Intensive Care Units. The pattern so far is that hospitalisations are not as bad as they were last January with the Delta iant.” Although the Omicron iant is generally regarded as being weaker than the Delta one that struck  months ago. Dr Black says that while young people who have been fully vaccinated maybe able to cope with it, the elderly may be more vulnerable to this iant. He added: “In September , Derry and District had the highest rate in Western Europe and we are more than four times higher than that rate now. The rates that weve seen in the past are so modest compared to what were seeing at the moment.   Figures from the Department of Health of positive Covid- cases in the North of Ireland.  “The rates at this moment are just phenomenal. You always worry about older, vulnerable people getting infected – certainly in Derry in the last week, weve seen more than five hundred patients in Derry and Strabane over sixty years old becoming infected. Across Northern Ireland that figure is more than three thousand. “Your worry from that is do those elderly and vulnerable patients end up in hospital  So far, our numbers for hospitalisations have only increased to around ten per cent in the last week or so. But we will be watching it very closely because although the Omicron iant is clearly a milder disease for younger people, we dont know yet how it will affect the elderly. “With Omicron, the factor here is how infectious is it. I think thats the major reason weve seen such a big increase. As throughout the pandemic, every time we think were successful, we become complacent and loosen up and complacency always leads to failure. “There was something about us being too complacent before Christmas in terms of bringing in enough restrictions early enough. That to some extent is the problem with a democracy. Politicians want to react to public sentiment rather than anticipate public sentiment. “You see in China, they closed down a million-person cityafter they get three positive results. WhereasBoris Johnson seems to be quite content to tolerate hundreds of thousands of infections per day because he thinks thats what the public seems to be wanting to tolerate. “Its a strange dichotomy in terms of how democracies respond to these pandemics.” The Health Service has been under considerable strain ever since the pandemic began almost two years ago. And Dr Black warns that the strain both the virus and the extra workloads it has brought upon the medical sector may well affect important services being delivered by the Health Serivice. He continued: “We worry about how the virus will affect iniduals in terms of their own health but also the effect that is happening on the Health Service with respect to the ability of staff to attend work. “The BMA mapping before Christmas suggested ten per cent of staff to be off with illness and a further ten to fteen per cent off due to isolation. Unfortunately, we seem to have been proven to have been correct. “Were seeing signicant numbers of staff missing – not just in general practice but in hospitals with nurses, doctors, paramedics and particularly in the ambulance service as well with response times from ambulances longer than we would want. “I see some of the ambulance services in the north of England were saying thatyou had a heart-attack, dont wait for an ambulance – go directly and get a lt to hospital. “Thats an extraordinary situation that were in that the virus is limiting the services for patients in other areas such as heart-attacks and strokes.” Meanwhile, the Western Trust has said it will continue with the temporary suspension of visitors to patients in hospitals, such as Altnagelvin in Derry. A short statement on the Western Trusts website read: “We would like to thank the public for their cooperation in relation to the recent changes to our visiting arrangements. Your support helps us to provide safer care for your relatives and friends who are currently in hospital. “Due to the continued pressures on our hospitals and the high level of COVID- transmission in the community, visiting remains suspended across our hospital sites and facilities. This does not apply to birthing partners, for maternity arrangements.” The Foyle Arena is serving as a mass vaccination centre. It is open between am to pm except on Friday, January  where it is open until pm. The centre is closed on Saturday, January  and Tuesday, January . Its opening hours on Wednesday, January  are pm to pm. The Shantallow Community Centre will be offering vaccinations on Tuesday, January  between pm to pm.

She argues that the new accommodation for the incoming undergraduates would be of immense benefit to the retail and hospitality sectors of Derrystudents were resident close to the citys heart. The student pound could help to kickstart the local economy – more so given the effects the pandemic has had on Derrys businesses. In the letter, Ms McLaughlin writes: “Our city will benefit substantially from the intake of new students. That benefit will increase even furtherthe new accommodation needed for them is located in or close to the city centre. “More specically,students live between campus and city centre this will have signicant positive impact on the commercial heart of the city, through its retail and hospitality sectors. I need hardly remind you of the hard times they have suffered over the last two years. “It is essential that core institutions such as the university work together with the public and private sectors, in order to maximise the combined impact. “I suggest this would in this instance be best achieve by providing student accommodation where it will have the most economic impact, which would be close of Derrys city centre. “Moreover, this would provide the best student experience by giving students easier access to the benefits of urban le, with close proximity to retail facilities and evening activities.” Explaining why she has taken it upon herself to write to Ulster University, Ms McLaughlin added: “I am urging the Ulster University Vice Chancellor, its Council and Senate to consider the potential benefits of their actions to the wider city. Our retail and hospitality sectors have suffered terribly through the pandemic, and locating new student accommodation close to the city centre would provide a real and much needed boost to our commercial sectors. “This, in turn, would help to safeguard existing jobs, as well as creating new jobs. I hope Ulster University will accept the logic of my argument. “While my party and I have campaigned for years for the expansion of Magee on the basis of the skills that will be created that will benefit the city and so will create well paid jobs, it is also very important that the expansion provides wider economic benefits through higher spending in the city and on local businesses. That, too, will create more jobs.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

The Foyle MP said that meetings with senior Tories and threats to trigger Article  are like groundhog day for people in Northern Ireland who want political leaders focused on our crumbling health service, the crisis in our schools and the spiraling cost of living. He said: “It really is incredible that with our health service under immense strain, our schools facing a Covid crisis and households across the North facing spiraling energy costs that the DUP has refused to abandon it’s disastrous campaign of threatening the institutions of government over the Northern Ireland Protocol. “Instead of addressing the real priorities that people are concerned about – getting the surgery they need, protecting jobs in their communities, providing a warm home for their family – the DUP is once again chasing influence with Tories at Westminster who will use them when it’s convenient and then dump them just as quickly. “They haven’t learned a thing from their last ugly break up with that party. “It is like groundhog day for people in Northern Ireland who want political leaders focused on the urgent priorities facing us. “The only outcome to Jeffrey Donaldson’s foolish crusade is more uncertainty and chaos at a time when we just can’t afford it. “Parties that are serious about government should be seeking to work together to improve the lives of people in our communities. “Instead we have establishment parties in a toxic race to see who can bring the government down first to meet their own selfish needs. People are sick of it.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

And a great way to make sure you’re on an even footing when it comes to motoring in  is by making some simple and easy checks around your car to confirm everything is as it should be. googletag.cmd.push But what should you be focusing on  Here, we’re going to take a look at some of the areas you might want to focus on. Interior   vw,vw,px, px\"  Don’t forget to vacuum areas in the middle of the cabin, too    Alright, so a clean interior isn’t critical to the roadworthiness of your car, but it’s a great place to start things off when it comes to checks. Plus, a tidy cabin will be far less distracting, while a lack of loose objects will ensure that nothing interferes with the major controls. So remove any items such as bottles or packets and wipe down areas such as the buttons and heating controls to ensure they’re bright and clean. A quick vacuum in the footwells can really help too. Tyres   vw,vw,px, px\"      Tyres are absolutely crucial. After all, they’re the only point of contact between your vehicle and the road so it’s paramount that they’re in good condition. First off, give the walls of the tyres an inspection are there any cracks or cuts  If so, they might need replacing. When it comes to tread, the legal minimum in Ireland is .mm. To check this, you could use an accurate tyre gauge – available to purchase from most motor factors and retailers – or a € coin. This latter method requires you torun a € coin along the centre of the wheel. If the gold part of the coin is not visible, then the tyre tread is ok. However,it is visible your tyre could be approaching the minimum legal depth so you should get them checked. You also need to check the pressure of the tyres. You’ll find the correct pressures for your vehicle either on the door sills or behind the fuel filler cap. Find this and simply inflate your tyres to the right pressure using a compressor, which are found at most petrol stations. Lights   vw,vw,px, px\"  Check that all of your lights are operating correctly   Lights are critical at this time of year. Not only are they needed to light up the road ahead, but they’re also required to make sure you’re visible to other road users. It’s why it’s a good idea to give them a check over. You can test your headlights – both dipped and full-beam – by operating them when parked close to a shiny surface, such as a garage door. When it comes to your rear lights, you could ask a friend to watch as you test them – or you can, again, reverse near to a reflective surface and operate them while looking in the rear-view mirror. Make sure you test your indicators, too – a blink that moves too quickly might mean that a bulb has blown and needs replacing. Washer fluid   vw,vw,px, px\"      You might have noticed that there’s a lot of dirt and grime on the roads at the moment and a great deal of this tends to end up on your windscreen. Because of this, it’s best to make sure that you’ve got plenty of washer fluid in your car so you can quickly and effectively clear your windscreen. On most cars, you’ll find the washer bottle under the bonnet, signied by a blue cap. Top it up to the correct level and make sure you’re using washer fluid – water on its own can freeze and cause damage to your car’s washer system. While you’re here, make sure your wipers are working effectively too –they’re making a rubbing noise or are smearing the windscreen, they’ll need replacing. Oil   vw,vw,px, px\"  Locating your car’s dipstick is a simple task. It’s usually marked out under the bonnet by a yellow cap.   While we’re under the bonnet, it’s a good idea to check your oil levels. This is easy to do, too. Simply remove the dipstickand clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Then, re-insert it back into its holder remove it again just after. Now, you’ll be able to read your car’s oil levels using the guide on the dipstick. If it’s too low, top it up via the oil filler using the correct oil for your car – you can find this in your vehicle’s handbook. Remember, only fill up in small increments and check your dipstick after each time. This helps to avoid overfilling. Windscreen   vw,vw,px, px\"  A windscreen might be requireda crack appears    Your car’s windscreen takes a real beating at this time of year, which is why there’s a greater chance of cracks or chips appearing. Take this opportunity to give your car’s windscreen an inspection to make sure that there’s nothing out of the ordinary. If you notice a small chip, then it’s a good idea to get it professionally repaired rather than leaving it to develop into a crack. This preventative repair is far cheaper than the cost of replacing an entire windscreen, after all. Remember, driving with a cracked windscreen can be deemed a motoring offenceit’s obscuring your view. If you’re stopped by police with a heavily cracked windscreen, it could lead to penalty points and a fine.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

We’re encouraged to make these ongoing health measures as much a part of the holiday as mulled wine and mince pies. Such steps can help protect our nearest and dearest while we’re together. The gt of protecting one another from COVID- – including the Omicron iant – is the one that truly keeps on giving. The weather outside may be “frightful” but, gathering indoors, we can still open windows to allow fresh air to disperse the virus. Embrace face coverings, there are seasonal styles aplenty to add festive flair to commuting and high street shopping trips. Every adult in the country needs to get a COVID- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Get your booster now at nhs.uk covidvaccination. Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the new Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent and more important than ever before because Omicron COVID- is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a COVID- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation. And, swter than shaving or applying makeup, taking rapid lateral flow tests are a quick and easy part of your getting ready routine before venturing out. If you have been in contact with someone with COVID- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. This will help slow the spread of the virus and allow you and your loved ones to continue your plans that dayyou test negative. If you are unvaccinated, you must continue to self-isolate for  daysyou are a contact of someone with COVID-. Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-, so keep it on. A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year, celebrate safely and let’s make it a good one. ‘It’s vital to ventilate’  Leeds University Professor of Environmental Engineering Catherine Noakes, pictured, said: “As Christmas is coming people will naturally be spending more time indoors – welcoming friends and family into their home and attending social events together – as the weather gets colder.While we are all looking forward to spending time with friends and family this Christmas, it’s important to remember that coronavirus is still spreading and can easily transmit in the home even when people are vaccinated.“In an enclosed space, the infectious particles hang around in the air like smoke and can build up over time, increasing the risk of other people in the room breathing in the virus, especiallythere is no ventilation or fresh air helping to refresh the air.“That’s why it’s so important to ventilate indoor spaces by opening windows, evenjust regularly for a short time. This way fresh air can disperse and blow COVID- particles away to decrease the risk of others being infected.”  Wish List  Vaccinations  All adults now need to get a booster vaccine, as two doses do not offer enough protection against the fast spreading Omicron iant. Boosters are available  weeks after second jabs. Get Boosted Now at nhs.uk covidvaccination to signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.  Taking tests  Make taking rapid lateral flow tests part of your festive preparations. Use any unused stocks of rapid lateral flow tests that you may have at homeCollect from your School Universityyou already obtain test kits from thereCollect from your local PharmacyCollect from your local Community Test sitesOrder online at gov.uk   Fresh air  Opening doors and windows for ten minutes can help you and your loved ones stay safe.  Face covering  To protect yourself and others, face coverings must be worn in shops, indoor venues and on public transport.

McGuigan did not concede a single goal until Desertmartins Ulster semi final defeat to eventual champions Denn of Cavan, and his kick outs provided ample opportunity for the young side in front of him to get at the opposition. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Thompsons pace and running ability saw him constantly encouraged to drive forward from his corner back position into the Dolans attack. He was particularly strong as his side regrouped in the semi final to overturn Moneymores lead, streaming forward at the encouragement of his team-mates to cause the opposition defence a number of problems.

The corner back is more than adept at the less glamorous nature of the position too, tenacious in the tackle, intense in his press and has the controlled aggression required to unsettle opposition attackers. Pic by Seamus McQuillan Mono Pix.  An old-school, sticky corner back, Walker was superb as Moneymore defeated Drum in the quarter final, and kept tabs on Dolans Kevin Nixon for much of the semi final. Walker was strong too in the quarter final win over Drum, producing some fine blocks and interventions to showcase his technical defending ability. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Hitting - in their semi final win over Craigbane, McElhennon has sickened defenders all year from deep. He also netted in their Ulster win over Donagh, and has shown a knack for attacking from deep with the poise and devastation of a heat-seeking missile. A key cog in Desertmartins running machine and a large part of their success this season. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Prone to a solo burst into the opposition half, he was particularly good against Drum, drawing an early save from their goalkeeper. Adept at sitting deep and playing the pivot as the men in front of him probe for a defensive opening, Moran has the game intelligence to know when to join the attack to create the overload and give the best opportunity for a score. Pic by Mary K Burke.  At the other side, Desertmartin had a mirror image of McElhennon in McEldowney, who was able to apply pressure on the opposite flank as St Martins hit teams with their speedy runners. Thrived in the space afforded to Desertmartin in their Ulster win over Donagh, and was a strong presence in their semi final defeat to Denn as well. Pic by Tom Heaney nwpresspics.  With his midfield partner Oran Kelly popping up in attacking positions, McGovern was the organiser, sitting back into the hole and looking for the opportunity to hurt the opposition. A calm head during the  final in June, he helped pave the way for that breakthrough success, using all his experience to see his side through a tough patch.  McGinleys experience and physical presence around the midfield area was a big boost for Dolans as they made their first JFC final since . An experienced head in the middle, he helped orchestrate their come-from-behind semi final win over Moneymore in Ballinascreen, and was a vocal organiser to have at centre field as he drove his team into the final. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  CDP Team of the Year : Hurling  See who has made our Team of the Year for last years hurling season.    Torturer-in-chief of a weary Moneymore defence in the semi final, McCosker hit two points and was named man of the match. His ball-carrying ability was key to that turnaround against Henry Joy McCrackens, not only resulting in his own scores, but yielding a number of frees for corner forward Odhran McKane to convert. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  McGuckin was a key link man in the St Martins side, choosing the correct option consistently and helping to probe opposition defences. Another experienced head to guide the younger players around him, the half forwards relentless movement helped create openings for the men around him, while he chipped in with crucial score of his own. Pic by Mary K Burke.  A threat all season, there was an excitement among the Moneymore side when Crozier received the ball. Comfortable running at defenders, he was a threat throughout their junior championship campaign, and was key in helping his side open up a lead in the semi final before a determined Sean Dolans side reeled them in. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Bloomer hit - against Sean Dolans in the semi final and - in a man of the match display against Drum in the quarter final. Showing a dogged determination to threaten the goal, he turned down marks on two occasions, opting to put the head down and go for the net. Both decisions resulted in a collective - as Bloomer showed a ruthlessness in front of the posts. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Murrays breakthrough season has seen him torment opposition defences with ceaseless energy and clinical finishing. His free-taking has also been a feature, and the precocious forward has been rewarded for a fine debut season at adult level with a call-up to Rory Gallaghers provisional Derry squad for the upcoming McKenna Cup. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Had a slow start in the semi final win over Moneymore, but was clinical in the pressure of the closing stages, finishing the game with four points. His free-taking, while errant in the early stages, was slick and composed when it mattered, with the game in the proverbial melting pot as his side chased down and overturned the Moneymore lead.

Pic by Mary K Burke. googletag.cmd.push Neil Forester  “Is this real ” yelled a delirious Neil Forester at the end of his sides championship final win over Greenlough. Youd forgive him for asking. The Brian Oacutegs captain has seen years of heartache and near misses, and when the crunch arrived in November, he produced a huge performance to finally clamber over the line. Starting the game on Enda Lynn, he pushed forward in the latter stages and marshalled attack and defence, almost omnipresent as Steelstown ended their hurt. It typied the leadership he showed all season, and he was central also as Brian Oacutegs shook off what was historically their bogey team in Castledawson at the quarter final stage. The public feedback reflected the good will towards a man very few would begrudge a county championship medal. “He puts his head where you wouldnt put a sock,” said one respondent, while another simply said he was a brilliant leader. A further respondent said he was a real GAA man. “He does it all for his club, other clubs and schools all around Derry and still puts in big performances when it matters. Heart of a lion and wise beyond his years,” they said. A hugely important player for Hugh McGraths men, Forester will continue the search for silverware this weekend as Steelstown take on Moortown in the Ulster IFC final in Glen.  Young stars join up with Derrys provisional football squad  A number of the All-Ireand winning minor team are training with the seniors.   Young Intermediate Footballer of the Year  The young midfielders aerial prowess was key to the Brian Oacutegs effort. Pic by Mary K Burke. Donncha Gilmore  Its been quite a year for Donncha Gilmore. He picked up Ulster and All-Ireland titles with the Derry minors and ended the year with an intermediate championship medal. The midfielder belied his years with a series of confident, mature performances in a championship where seasoned giants are in plentul supply at centre field. With the county final in the melting pot, he rose to field the ball among a scattering of players, raising a roar from the crowd and lting his team mates. The Steelstown man was a popular choice throughout the public feedback, with his exploits in the Oakleaf jersey no doubt contributing. “He has been brilliant for Derry and Steelstown, an All-Ireland winner and a Derry championship winner, with more to come,” said one respondent. Another said he covered every blade of grass throughout the championship, while another – who was liberal with the blue and yellow heart emojis – said he was pure class. In a nod to the midfielders modesty and work ethic, another response said the young man has no idea just how good he is. Gilmore can look forward to Sundays Ulster IFC final as well, and will feature in manager Rory Gallaghers provisional squad for the upcoming season.

Pic by Philip Fitzpatrick Sportsfile. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran McFaul  If great players have everything in their locker, Ciaran McFaul probably needed a second one last season. The Glen talisman was imperious in the number  role into which Malachy ORourke moulded him in . In the biggest game of the year, the county final against Slaughtneil, he hammered over three points and dictated the game in the same manner he had done all season. That Donegal champions St Eunans set out to shut him down in their Ulster SFC clash in Letterkenny is a mark of just how influential McFaul has been. His name also dominated the responses to our online poll, with one respondent in particular waxing lyrical, saying McFall was arguably the greatest talent ever produced in Derry football. “What an absolute work horse he is on the field, any position that man turns the bolts in any match. He can read a game super and his dummies are without a doubt the best in Ulster,” said another. A further respondent said he redefined the number  role, while another quite simply said the centre back was pure class. Able to dictate play from deep, he has arrived on the end of attacks with perfect timing, while also performing his defensive duties with commitment.  Derry manager looking for continuity after stop-start tenure to date  Rory Gallagher said he was delighted to see theof the McKenna Cup.   Young Senior Footballer of the Year  Doherty in action against Kilcoo in the Ulster semi final. Pic by David Fitzgerald Sportsfile. Ethan Doherty  Ethan Doherty was still at school when the Covid pandemic started. Less than two years later, he helped Glen lt the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time. Stepping straight into the first team at both club and county level, the rise of the former St Patricks College captain has been meteoric. Every inch the modern wing back, his power, pace and ability to break the line have been a key part of Malachy ORourkes Glen machine. The GAA community in Derry have also been quick to recognise his precocious talent, and he was a hugely popular choice in our public feedback. Amid numerous goat emojis, one respondent suggested he could play anywhere, while another said his selection as Young Player of the Year was merely common sense. “The engine of Glens back line with constant running. He never gave up and always looked to drive the ball forward to create scoring opportunities,” said a further response. One particular respondent kept it simple, nominating him for the award because he roasts everyone. Doherty is a player with a big future, and, already performing at the highest level for both club and county, the possibilities seem almost endless.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Steelstown Brian Ogs are Ulster Intermediate champions!Second half comeback sees Brian Ogs overcome MoortownSteelstown Brian Ogs are Ulster Intermediate champions!Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Moortown - Steelstown - Steelstown Brian Ogs are the Ulster Intermediate champions after a determined second half showing to overcome Moortown at Owenbeg. googletag.cmd.push Hugh McGraths team looked to be in some trouble as they managed just one single score in the entirety of the first half, and trailed -, - at the break, having struggled to get through Moortowns blanket defence. Peter Devlin hit each of Moortowns scores in that period, while Cahir McMonagle responded with Steelstowns first score on  minutes. But it was a frustrating first half for the Derry side who hit four wides as they struggled to replicate their usual free-scoring game. It required a dferent type of skill in the second half and when McMonagle struck again just nine minutes in, Brian Ogs had hope. Time continued to tick away but  minutes into the second period, McMonagle struck his third point, a real beauty to tie up the game at -, and the travelling Steelstown crowd sensed the title was there for the taking. With just minutes remaining, Emmet Deane first Steelstown into the lead for the first time, and when McMonagle hit his fourth point of the game soon after, the job was almost done. Con Heron fisted the ball over the bar for Moortowns first core of the second half to make it a one-point game again, but in the dying seconds McMonagle struck again, with the final whistle following shortly afterwards to confirm Steelstown Brian Ogs as the Ulster champions for the first time in the clubs history.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Orlagh Mullan Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Sunday th January  is a day that Steelstown will never forget. The day that they became champions of Ulster for the first time in their history. googletag.cmd.push Just two and a half months after winning their first Derry championship, the men of Brian Oacuteg’s came through their toughest challenge yet to overcome a dogged Moortown by - to - at a packed Owenbeg. Having dispatched of Cloughaneely, Donaghmoyne and Butlersbridge in some style on their way to the provincial showpiece, this was a totally dferent game in which Steelstown where often frustrated and only led for the first time in the th minute but, by the final whistle, they didn’t care one bit.  As manager Hugh McGrath took in the scenes of blue and gold on the field afterwards, he said it was a special and unforgettable day for the people of Steelstown, and also paid tribute to the late Brian Oacuteg McKeever after whom the club is named. “We thought Derry champions sounded good, but Ulster champions certainly has a ring to it! When you put the hard work in that these lads have and you’ve had so many close calls and disappointments, to get over the line in something so close and so tight and so nervy – it just means even more. Steelstown as Ulster champions is one that will live in the memory for a long time,” he said. “All week leading up to it there was an excitement in the group about being in the final but the big thing we were saying was that we were so proud that Brian Oacuteg’s name was being mentioned on a provincial level and in some places on a national level. For us that’s huge. McGrath continued: “We all know in the city what he was about and why we’re named after him, but when you see the way we dug that out today – that’s Brian Oacuteg McKeever. That spirit is exactly what it was. “We’re really proud. Lots of teams say that they’re proud, but we are immensely proud of getting that name on the map and hopefully we can get it on the national stage and make even more people aware of that. Evenit’s just to get them interested and to find out why we’re called Brian Oacuteg’s – great – because that story needs to be told all over.” DREAM COME TRUE As Steelstown captain Neil Forester made his way up the steps of Owenbeg to collect the cup, the only words he could utter were ‘this is the stuff of dreams.’ “It hasn’t sunk in,” admitted Forester afterwards. “There was maybe huge relief and satisfaction after the county final, but this is a dferent level. “Getting out of Derry was such a big thing for us because we just hadn’t done it. I kept saying just get past Cloughaneely in the first round and then you get the ball rolling then you don’t know what can happen with the momentum. We were brilliant that day, but the crossbar still had to save us and maybe that was that little bit of luck we needed. “This team has just grown and grown. To win an Ulster title against a fantastic and dogged Moortown team in conditions that probably suited them and their defensive style is special. The fact that all those habits and the hard work that we put in has paid off. “It’s literally unbelievable. We were talking about getting our monkey off the back in Derry but once we did that we have just kicked on so much. I honestly don’t know what  to say.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Orlagh Mullan Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Sunday th January  is a day that Steelstown will never forget. The day that they became champions of Ulster for the first time in their history. googletag.cmd.push Just two and a half months after winning their first Derry championship, the men of Brian Oacuteg’s came through their toughest challenge yet to overcome a dogged Moortown by - to - at a packed Owenbeg. Having dispatched of Cloughaneely, Donaghmoyne and Butlersbridge in some style on their way to the provincial showpiece, this was a totally dferent game in which Steelstown where often frustrated and only led for the first time in the th minute but, by the final whistle, they didn’t care one bit.  As manager Hugh McGrath took in the scenes of blue and gold on the field afterwards, he said it was a special and unforgettable day for the people of Steelstown, and also paid tribute to the late Brian Oacuteg McKeever after whom the club is named. “We thought Derry champions sounded good, but Ulster champions certainly has a ring to it! When you put the hard work in that these lads have and you’ve had so many close calls and disappointments, to get over the line in something so close and so tight and so nervy – it just means even more. Steelstown as Ulster champions is one that will live in the memory for a long time,” he said. “All week leading up to it there was an excitement in the group about being in the final but the big thing we were saying was that we were so proud that Brian Oacuteg’s name was being mentioned on a provincial level and in some places on a national level. For us that’s huge. McGrath continued: “We all know in the city what he was about and why we’re named after him, but when you see the way we dug that out today – that’s Brian Oacuteg McKeever. That spirit is exactly what it was. “We’re really proud. Lots of teams say that they’re proud, but we are immensely proud of getting that name on the map and hopefully we can get it on the national stage and make even more people aware of that. Evenit’s just to get them interested and to find out why we’re called Brian Oacuteg’s – great – because that story needs to be told all over.” DREAM COME TRUE As Steelstown captain Neil Forester made his way up the steps of Owenbeg to collect the cup, the only words he could utter were ‘this is the stuff of dreams.’ “It hasn’t sunk in,” admitted Forester afterwards. “There was maybe huge relief and satisfaction after the county final, but this is a dferent level. “Getting out of Derry was such a big thing for us because we just hadn’t done it. I kept saying just get past Cloughaneely in the first round and then you get the ball rolling then you don’t know what can happen with the momentum. We were brilliant that day, but the crossbar still had to save us and maybe that was that little bit of luck we needed. “This team has just grown and grown. To win an Ulster title against a fantastic and dogged Moortown team in conditions that probably suited them and their defensive style is special. The fact that all those habits and the hard work that we put in has paid off. “It’s literally unbelievable. We were talking about getting our monkey off the back in Derry but once we did that we have just kicked on so much. I honestly don’t know what  to say.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Over the course of  years, I don’t think I’ve argued with anyone as much as I did with Sean O’Kane. googletag.cmd.push I mean, how can anyone seriously say to me that Jackie McNamara was a better footballer than Ryan Giggs  It was  and we were in the canteen of St. Columb’s College on the Buncrana Road, and he was adamant. One thing about Sean was that he was always passionate and he always stuck to his guns, eventhe truth was staring him right in the face. ‘I’m telling you Gary, he’s a far better player. Giggs is over-rated. And I’ll tell you another thing – any team that signs John Collins will win the Premier League.’ He actually said these words to me! Even now, when I’m trying to swallow the lump in my throat writing about my friend, I have to laugh and shake my head at that statement. John Collins went on to join Everton and he never, ever came near the Premier League title. We were both in our mid-teens, and the only thing that really mattered at that stage was football. This was the time of Oasis and Blur, where the internet didn’t exist, and your mood depended on how your team did at the weekend. Sean was Celtic through and through, just as I was Manchester United, and we rarely,ever, agreed on things on the pitch. I think it was the fact that we agreed on so many things off the pitch which ensured that we became friends. We were massive WWE fans, andwe weren’t lost in conversations about what Stone Cold Steve Austin did to Vince McMahon one week, we were laughing about what The Rock said the next week. We were proper wrestling geeks, a trait that connected us for  years after we left St. Columb’s, andever I needed to vent about anything wrestling-wise, Sean was the one to talk to. We also spent days, weeks and months playing football after school or during the summer holidays when his family moved to Fernabbey he, his brother Fergal, and sometimes his sisters Ciara and Eireann , would meet us all at the Youth Club in Lenamore and we would wile away the hours. At the weekend, it became more serious and we would go to the gravel pitches at the Sports Complex, before walking home together, barging and complaining and laughing the whole time. Sean was always an older head on younger shoulders. He consoled and talked me through my undying love for a teacher at St. Columb’s in those early years. Needless to say I am mortied looking back, but when I do look through my fingers at that cringeworthy period of my le, I remember Sean there, telling me she was a married woman and for me to wise up, in his own unique way of course. Oh and his coat! For some reason, his parents bought him this big warm winter coat, emblazoned with the Celtic crest. There’s nothing wrong with that, but for some utterly bizarre reason, on this coat designed for Baltic weather, the arms were detachable with a zip. I mean, why  That became the bane of Sean’s existence as we used to take off the arms and hide them and he would have to walk around school looking for them. But he loved that coat! Sean and I were also among the few in the school who, when we turned  – on the exact same day – refused to drink alcohol. I was never that interested and he was the same, but that lasted about as long as a Celtic title challenge these days as our other class mates – Colm McCloskey, Neal Sharkey, Paul McColgan, Gerard Grey and Piaras O’ Donaghalie got their hands on him. Before you knew it, Sean was living the le and living the hangovers, and that innocent -year-old teetotaller was lost to history. Le took us in dferent direction for a few years after that but it was Derry City FC which brought us back into the same circles. I was a junior reporter at the Derry News, and Stephen Kenny was taking the team places after years of struggle. Like any true Derry bandwagoner, Sean decided to come along and see what the fuss was about, bringing his good friend Damien Tracey along with him. The fact that his sister Ciara was playing for Derry City Ladies and dating Gareth McGlynn may have had something to do with it also. For a number of years, we would always meet at the games, and revel in a rich period for the Candystripes. It got to the stage that we went in on a bet together – Derry City to win - every game. I remember one such game, City were - up and won a penalty. Mark Farren stepped up to hit it and he missed! Sean was not amused, but luckily Liam Kearney headed one in late on and we were delighted, taking back everything we called Farrenso! I clicked so well with Sean, but I could never be as outspoken as him. He wasn’t shy in holding back his opinion and I always marvelled at that, simply because I couldn’t do it. I’m sure his colleagues and students at St. Joseph’s know what I’m talking about he was just so interesting, and he never failed to make me laugh with his witty observations and devastating putdowns. The fact that both Damien and Sean are gone now weighs heavily on me. I was driving on Saturday evening and it struck me how I wouldn’t hear Sean’s voice again, or read his texts when he would be calling Scott Brown a fraud or Neil Lennon a joke, or venting about whoever had annoyed him that particular week. Sean was able to accompany me to the Brandywell twice last year, for games against Shamrock Rovers and Drogheda United, and I’m so glad that happened. I know he enjoyed those games, and I enjoyed his company, and we laughed about the stupid things as we always did. I can’t claim to be Sean’s best friend, and I don’t knowhe would describe me as a friend or an acquaintance, but the fact that I could always text him about stupid stuff was something I always appreciated. I was on the periphery of his le in the sense that I didn’t go out with him or wasn’t party to his struggles as he fought, fought and fought his battles, but I have always considered him a friend, and I am so damn sad that he has gone. I’m in this job nearly  years and still I would be asking him to correct my headlines andthis or that sentence was grammatically correct. He was a self-proclaimed ‘Grammar grump’, as am I, which brings up another memory. We were in Wexford for the  League Cup final, and in the bar for the celebrations afterwards, another friend of mines looked on agog, as Sean and I complained about people’s grammar. It was ridiculous, but that’s what we were like together. Football, WWE and grammar. I know Sean was so well thought of at St. Joseph’s, at Tristar, and far beyond both in local circles. We were born on the exact same day – March ,  – and maybe that’s the reason I always felt so strongly linked to him. But we were linked by much more than our date of birth, and for that I am appreciative and for that I’ll remember him forever. Others can tell better stories and others will have been much closer to Sean than I was, and I can only imagine what they’re feeling today. Those students who have paid tribute to him on Facebook had a wonderful teacher – not just someone who knew the dference between a comma and an apostrophe, but who was willing to talk to them, to tell them stories, to give them advice, to connect with them on a human level. That kind of teacher is not so easy to find, believe me. Those students are the lucky ones. His best friends, who spent so many hours with him in good times and bad, are the lucky ones, His family, who were with him every step of the way, who made him laugh, who made him strong, who cared and consoled and supported him in those hard, hard days – they are the lucky ones. To have known him at all, makes me a lucky one. It is so hard to say goodbye to you Sean, so I won’t. Instead I’ll say thank you, so much, for arguing with me all those years and for making me laugh so often. And for the record – it took him  years, but he did eventually admit that he was wrong about Jackie McNamara. Better late than never. The page is blurry now as I write these final lines with tears in my eyes, but I’m pretty sure Sean is reading over this shaking his head at any spelling or grammar mistakes I must surely have made. I would expect nothing less from one of the best people I ever knew. Thank you for everything Sean. Until we meet again.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Over the course of  years, I don’t think I’ve argued with anyone as much as I did with Sean O’Kane. googletag.cmd.push I mean, how can anyone seriously say to me that Jackie McNamara was a better footballer than Ryan Giggs  It was  and we were in the canteen of St. Columb’s College on the Buncrana Road, and he was adamant. One thing about Sean was that he was always passionate and he always stuck to his guns, eventhe truth was staring him right in the face. ‘I’m telling you Gary, he’s a far better player. Giggs is over-rated. And I’ll tell you another thing – any team that signs John Collins will win the Premier League.’ He actually said these words to me! Even now, when I’m trying to swallow the lump in my throat writing about my friend, I have to laugh and shake my head at that statement. John Collins went on to join Everton and he never, ever came near the Premier League title. We were both in our mid-teens, and the only thing that really mattered at that stage was football. This was the time of Oasis and Blur, where the internet didn’t exist, and your mood depended on how your team did at the weekend. Sean was Celtic through and through, just as I was Manchester United, and we rarely,ever, agreed on things on the pitch. I think it was the fact that we agreed on so many things off the pitch which ensured that we became friends. We were massive WWE fans, andwe weren’t lost in conversations about what Stone Cold Steve Austin did to Vince McMahon one week, we were laughing about what The Rock said the next week. We were proper wrestling geeks, a trait that connected us for  years after we left St. Columb’s, andever I needed to vent about anything wrestling-wise, Sean was the one to talk to. We also spent days, weeks and months playing football after school or during the summer holidays when his family moved to Fernabbey he, his brother Fergal, and sometimes his sisters Ciara and Eireann , would meet us all at the Youth Club in Lenamore and we would wile away the hours. At the weekend, it became more serious and we would go to the gravel pitches at the Sports Complex, before walking home together, barging and complaining and laughing the whole time. Sean was always an older head on younger shoulders. He consoled and talked me through my undying love for a teacher at St. Columb’s in those early years. Needless to say I am mortied looking back, but when I do look through my fingers at that cringeworthy period of my le, I remember Sean there, telling me she was a married woman and for me to wise up, in his own unique way of course. Oh and his coat! For some reason, his parents bought him this big warm winter coat, emblazoned with the Celtic crest. There’s nothing wrong with that, but for some utterly bizarre reason, on this coat designed for Baltic weather, the arms were detachable with a zip. I mean, why  That became the bane of Sean’s existence as we used to take off the arms and hide them and he would have to walk around school looking for them. But he loved that coat! Sean and I were also among the few in the school who, when we turned  – on the exact same day – refused to drink alcohol. I was never that interested and he was the same, but that lasted about as long as a Celtic title challenge these days as our other class mates – Colm McCloskey, Neal Sharkey, Paul McColgan, Gerard Grey and Piaras O’ Donaghalie got their hands on him. Before you knew it, Sean was living the le and living the hangovers, and that innocent -year-old teetotaller was lost to history. Le took us in dferent direction for a few years after that but it was Derry City FC which brought us back into the same circles. I was a junior reporter at the Derry News, and Stephen Kenny was taking the team places after years of struggle. Like any true Derry bandwagoner, Sean decided to come along and see what the fuss was about, bringing his good friend Damien Tracey along with him. The fact that his sister Ciara was playing for Derry City Ladies and dating Gareth McGlynn may have had something to do with it also. For a number of years, we would always meet at the games, and revel in a rich period for the Candystripes. It got to the stage that we went in on a bet together – Derry City to win - every game. I remember one such game, City were - up and won a penalty. Mark Farren stepped up to hit it and he missed! Sean was not amused, but luckily Liam Kearney headed one in late on and we were delighted, taking back everything we called Farrenso! I clicked so well with Sean, but I could never be as outspoken as him. He wasn’t shy in holding back his opinion and I always marvelled at that, simply because I couldn’t do it. I’m sure his colleagues and students at St. Joseph’s know what I’m talking about he was just so interesting, and he never failed to make me laugh with his witty observations and devastating putdowns. The fact that both Damien and Sean are gone now weighs heavily on me. I was driving on Saturday evening and it struck me how I wouldn’t hear Sean’s voice again, or read his texts when he would be calling Scott Brown a fraud or Neil Lennon a joke, or venting about whoever had annoyed him that particular week. Sean was able to accompany me to the Brandywell twice last year, for games against Shamrock Rovers and Drogheda United, and I’m so glad that happened. I know he enjoyed those games, and I enjoyed his company, and we laughed about the stupid things as we always did. I can’t claim to be Sean’s best friend, and I don’t knowhe would describe me as a friend or an acquaintance, but the fact that I could always text him about stupid stuff was something I always appreciated. I was on the periphery of his le in the sense that I didn’t go out with him or wasn’t party to his struggles as he fought, fought and fought his battles, but I have always considered him a friend, and I am so damn sad that he has gone. I’m in this job nearly  years and still I would be asking him to correct my headlines andthis or that sentence was grammatically correct. He was a self-proclaimed ‘Grammar grump’, as am I, which brings up another memory. We were in Wexford for the  League Cup final, and in the bar for the celebrations afterwards, another friend of mines looked on agog, as Sean and I complained about people’s grammar. It was ridiculous, but that’s what we were like together. Football, WWE and grammar. I know Sean was so well thought of at St. Joseph’s, at Tristar, and far beyond both in local circles. We were born on the exact same day – March ,  – and maybe that’s the reason I always felt so strongly linked to him. But we were linked by much more than our date of birth, and for that I am appreciative and for that I’ll remember him forever. Others can tell better stories and others will have been much closer to Sean than I was, and I can only imagine what they’re feeling today. Those students who have paid tribute to him on Facebook had a wonderful teacher – not just someone who knew the dference between a comma and an apostrophe, but who was willing to talk to them, to tell them stories, to give them advice, to connect with them on a human level. That kind of teacher is not so easy to find, believe me. Those students are the lucky ones. His best friends, who spent so many hours with him in good times and bad, are the lucky ones, His family, who were with him every step of the way, who made him laugh, who made him strong, who cared and consoled and supported him in those hard, hard days – they are the lucky ones. To have known him at all, makes me a lucky one. It is so hard to say goodbye to you Sean, so I won’t. Instead I’ll say thank you, so much, for arguing with me all those years and for making me laugh so often. And for the record – it took him  years, but he did eventually admit that he was wrong about Jackie McNamara. Better late than never. The page is blurry now as I write these final lines with tears in my eyes, but I’m pretty sure Sean is reading over this shaking his head at any spelling or grammar mistakes I must surely have made. I would expect nothing less from one of the best people I ever knew. Thank you for everything Sean. Until we meet again.

East Down AC had four runners, all female and as mentioned, Sharon Madine was only there by default.Having got lost en-route and failed to get to the K start, she felt that the only way to save face was to run the K.She actually ran very well and in the end was happy to have doubled her exercise goal for the day. Her time of . placed her as th female out of  and was not that far off her personal best.This is impressive since she prefers K to K and also that she arrived with no intention of racing that distance.In addition the blustery conditions were not ideal for chasing times. Alison and Ella Carroll opted for the K over the K based on the later start and the chance of a lie in.It turned out that the rain had also eased by then so it was a good call.

Kudos to Glenn Grant for his efforts to make this happen.Meanwhile closer to home, the rain had cleared early on to give a bright mild day. Gordy Graham was out for the Burren Townland ten miler and said it was almost too warm.The contrast in the photos of this compared to the Belfast meet is marked. Gordy had a great race and took the win by a clear margin in a time of . but he was keen to point out that his closest adversary, Brendan Heaney, was denied the chance to race it out when he took an unfortunate tumble.Gordy had the good grace to help his rival up but it seemed that the fall took its toll and Brendan never really got back on track.He did hold on to second place but he was four minutes behind Gordy in the end. Another podium for Gordy to end a successful year. It was no surprise to find that Niall Gibney was in the mountains on Boxing Day.However, this time instead of a solo escapade, he had signed up for the annual Turkey trot organised by BARF .This arduous run started at Meelmore Lodge then headed up the lane to the Mourne Wall. The climbing continued up to Trassey Track Ford and then up to the Bernagh-Meelmore col.Niall said that the paths were like mini streams after the deluge on Christmas Day and he described the river crossing below the col as ldquointeresting.To others that probably means practically impassable but the runners toiled on finally reaching Meelmore-Meelbeg Saddle.Our intrepid mountain man reported that, ldquoFrom here the brakes were off and it was a fun fast slippery downhill to the Happy Valley.

Registration had opened months in advance and entries sold out in record time, a clear indication that this race has become a firm favourite for the elite and the not so elite runner.For most, it is the sense of turning up on the day not knowing what to expect. The race has two unique selling points.Firstly, you have to run with a partner and you are only ever as good as your other half.Many alliances come unstuck on the hills and in the mud and friendships are often lost, regained and lost again as the race unfolds.Secondly, and perhaps more uniquely, only a select few know the course in advance and they are sworn to secrecy.This is unusual in that most of us go to a race knowing what to expect in terms of distance, terrain and elevation: not so with this one.The only information is that it begins and ends in Castlewellan and it is between eight-and-a-half and nine miles .The course this year was a very tightly guarded secret with only those entrusted to assist with the marking on the eve of the race getting any real insight.When asked to describe the course, the Prophet simply stated: lsquoit will stun the legs and play with the headrsquo.These words rang in my head as I ran around fields that I never expected to, climbed hills that I never climbed before and at one point,my eyesight is not failing, saw Sherpa Tenzing throwing down ropes and herding a cabinet of yaks.At the business end of proceeding, there was some real class on parade with Irish mountain running sensation Zak Hannapaired with Andrew Annett , a man in great form as evidenced by his superb win in the Armagh Ten.This international pairing with real climbing pedigree firmly lived up to their billing as odds-on favourites and were almost three minutes ahead of their nearest challengers, the youthful pairing of Jared Martinand Tom Crudgington .With many years of running ahead, both these young men are capable of winning the race in the not-too-distant future.The podium was completed by the last minute pairing of Jonny Scottand Aaron McGrady , who hooked up on the morning of the event due to late withdrawals.The chemistry was clearly good and the partnership worked as they came home in just over  minutes ndash  seconds adrt of Martin and Crudgington.The ladiesrsquo race was a tighter affair with Amanda Perry and Denise Logue from Ballydrain winning by  seconds from Dearbhla Coxand Niamh Donnelly .The podium was completed by Clair Quigley and Fiona McQuillan .The mixed team event is always closely fought and this year was no dferent.

In July  he went on a preaching tour of Ulster, achieving wide popularity.RebellionBack in Co Down, and during the  Rebellion period, his preaching activities on one occasion brought him into collision with the military authorities. His father was actually Moderator in the year of the Rising.Dr Moses needed permission from General Nugent to hold the General Synodin Lurgan that August. One Sunday in  his son William was invited back to his fatherrsquos church, to preach in Irish. The event generated considerable interest, and the church was packed.The authorities were nervous in the wake of the rebellion and news of this unusually large assembly soon reached official ears.Halfway through the sermon a party of yeomen entered the church. With no space left to seat them, they occupied the twin staircases leading up to the pulpit. When William had finished preaching they promptly arrested him, and seized theof his sermon.The soldiers involved were likely from the Kilmore Yeomanry. Their Lieutenant at the time was Charles Hamilton, William Strain of Kilmore was a sergeant, and Patrick Soy of \"Tollinagrew\" a private.They marched William all the way to Down Gaol in Downpatrick, newly opened on the Mall in  . Their arrival likely caused some consternation with the Gaol Governor, because the Neilson clergy were widely known to be loyal to the Crown.Rev William bailed by Rev JamesScrambling to smooth over this military faux pas, the Governor sent across town for James Neilson, brother of the prisoner, and minister of the nearby Stream Street Presbyterian congregation. The Rev William was then bailed into the custody of the Rev James,with instructions to appear in court next day.Next morning the magistrate encountered a dficulty mdash he couldnrsquot understand the manuscript of Williamrsquos sermon, preached in Irish the day before. William helpfully offered to translate. It transpired the contents were innocuous, and the prisoner was promptly released. The details of this intriguing episode were recorded a century later by a Neilson descendant .Academic careerIn Dundalk William ran a Classical and mercantile academy similar to his fatherrsquos. In an astonishing burst of creativity, he continued to develop his skills as a linguist.In  he published Greek exercises in syntax, ellipsis, dialects, prosody and metaphrasis. In recognition of this, Glasgow University awarded him an honorary DD in . In  he was elected Presbyterian Moderator. In  he published Introduction to the Irish language, on the basis of which he was elected MRIA in .There were a number of advantages in learning Irish, William explained. For academics, it gave essential insights into other European languages. And for the wider population, it enabled competent communication with those large sections of the population whose first language was still Irish.In contemporary Ireland, he asserted, clergymen, lawyers and farmers could not conduct their business properly without a knowledge of Irish.Paradoxically, the subjects taught in schools run by the Neilson clergy, and others, eventually undermined the use of Irish nationally. The Industrial Revolution was in full swing, and employment opportunities in industry and commerce were exploding.For those without a knowledge of English, Irish-only fluency was becoming an overwhelming disadvantage. When the new national school system was instituted in Ireland in , teachers knew that English was now the essential passport to wider employment.The great Daniel OrsquoConnell ruefully acknowledged the new reality. ldquoAlthough the language is associated with many recollections that twine round the hearts of Irishmen, yet the superior utility of the English tongue, as the medium of all modern communication is so great, that I can witness, without a sigh, the gradual disuse of Irish.At that time there were a number of ieties of Irish, but under the new dispensation the vernacular spoken in East Ulster eventually became extinct. Fortunately William Neilson preserved many Co Down examples in his  Grammar. In the words of his descendant Joseph Nelson, Williamrsquos ldquodialogues and familiar phrases, which form the second part, are a complete guide to the ideas as well as the phrases of the peasantry.Untimely deathIn  William was appointed professor of classical languages and Hebrew at the Belfast Academical Institution. In April  he was elected professor of Classics at Glasgow University. However, he had contracted rheumatic fever, and died on the th of that month, aged only . He was buried in the family vault close to the west gable of his fatherrsquos church in Rademon.A full colour pamphlet based on this article has been produced by Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Group, to accompany Joyce Gibsonrsquos ongoing Irish language classes in Ballynahinch Market House..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5January2022_LinenHall.jpg","title":"Tributes to former chief librarian at Linen Hall Library who was also decorated Gaelic player  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND man who was the custodian of some of Northern Irelandrsquos most precious books and written history will be buried tomorrow.The former chief librarian of Belfastrsquos Linen Hall Library, John Killen was hailed as a ldquogentleman and friend to all after he died peacefully at his home on Sunday.A respected author, historian and former Gaelic footballer, Mr Killen was aged .He had worked at Irelandrsquos oldest and last subion library for  years and became friends with some of its most regular visitors, such as the poet Seamus Heaney, writers Sam Hanna Bell, John Hewitt, Joseph Tomelty and the artist Padraic Woods.Mr Killen retired in January , after taking up his first role as an Irish reference librarian at the Linen Hall in .He was known for continuing the work of a former colleague, Jimmy Vitty, by establishing an extensive political papers section of posters, prisonersrsquo books and records from the Maze Long Kesh.The collection houses more than , separate items and is now used by academics and students from across the world.Among the many books written by Mr Killen was the story of the  year-old library, along with the Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.One of his most recent books was The St Patrickrsquos Treasury, a celebration of the myths, legends and traditions of Irelandrsquos patron saint who is buried in the grounds of Down Cathedral.Mr Killen was also highly regarded as a county hurler and Gaelic footballer who won championship medals, having played for his home club Loughinisland, Downpatrickrsquos RGU and Queenrsquos.Loughinisland GAC said on social media the club was ldquodevastated to learn of Mr Killenrsquos death who had also been a member and secretary in .He won two championship medals with the club in  and .Mr Killen, who was reared in Saul, started as a Gaelic footballer with RGU.He won several Minor championships medals for the Downpatrick side, including leading them to victory over Loughinisland in the SFC final in .Queenrsquos GAA remembered on social media how Mr Killen was a former Sigerson Cup player from - and was also part of the first All-Ireland Freshers winning team in .The Linen Hall Library shared its reaction to the sad news on social media.It said of its former head: ldquoJohn joined the Library in  and dedicated the next  years to this institution.

This body of work celebrates the humanism and psychological dexterity of us all, both inidually and as a gender sector.ldquoWorking as an inidual to support equality for both males and females is wonderful.ldquoBut, by working together to achieve it as a society. Then we are invincible and real change can happen.She added: ldquoThis is especially relevant during these unprecedented, pandemic times. Where the glass ceiling still remains almost permanently unbroken.ldquoMore importantly, domestic abuse has increased horrendously, behind shut doors during the  months of lockdown.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Cathy Mason is supporting the event.She said: ldquoWomen are key to the fabric of our society and the day to day working of our world. Yet, we still see women disproportionately under-represented in areas such as education employment and leadership. No doubt women are also disproportionately affected by austerity including the cuts to Universal Credit and cuts to public sector jobs.ldquoIt is sad that still today, women continue to face long standing structural inequalities that push more women out of employment and into a state of economic deadlock.Taking a male view point on the subject, Cllr Glyn Hanna said: ldquoI have been involved in politics for years and also have a business. I have seen on many occasions that there remain equality issues for women in work places.ldquoI have three daughters who all have professional jobs. I have been told by them of their experiences of sexual discrimination and inequality and their feelings that they have to work harder to get respect doing a job. More work does need done to address this problem urgently.Agreeing with both councillors, Lise said: ldquoWhat the councillors are saying is so true. So passionate am I to keep female equality high on the public agenda, itrsquos the focus of the creation and touring of this exhibition. It is at the core of my lsquoI Am Womanrsquo Arts and Cultural Programme.She added: ldquoI am focused on promoting all forms of equality and ersity in Northern Ireland.The I Am Woman programme was first launched at Parliament Buildings, Stormont, in September and was attended by MLAs and VIPs.But Lisersquos work is not just focused at reaching the ear of politicians.She said: ldquoMy personal agenda is more about reaching out and spreading the necessity for equality, in all formats. In all walks of our society, from both a ground level up and top down.ldquoI feel that we all have a moral responsibility, when it comes to supporting and promoting female, and other, equality here in Northern Ireland. Forwe donrsquot work together, then nothing changes.ldquoMy programmes are embracing, not preaching. They aim to break down the dferences we have as a society by promoting better knowledge, tolerance and understanding.ldquoThe laws that govern us all, especially those written in relation to females, do definitely need to change for equality to happen.She continued: ldquoWe, as a society, also have to encourage change from the ground level up. Educating our young people and changing adult preconceived perceptions are also so important.ldquoBoys and girls, men and women. We are all iniduals who should be treated fairly and equally. By law, and by society in general.ldquoIt is therefore important to engage and stand up for change now. Otherwise, females will continue to be treated as second class citizens in Northern Ireland, for generations to come.ldquoBoth males and females have so much to give our society. In order for a fairer, more democratic society to exist. Females should always be treated equally at all levels.Lise added: ldquoAfter all, it is women who make up the majority of the adult population in this country.This is Lisersquos third project to be showcased at Parliament Buildings.Any school or business interested in hosted Lisersquos exhibitions and or workshops should email LiseMcGreevyPhotographic@gmail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13358566.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

As you will have heard in the media, this new Omicron iant of COVID is very infectious. But it does not appear to cause serious illnessyou have been double or triple vaccinated. But frankly I am shocked how badly the biochemistry of this virus has been explained by politicians and so-called experts. As a biochemist with an international reputation please forgive meI try to explain. When you are vaccinated in the arm the main antibody generated is called IgG. This should stop serious illness. But when you get infected in the respiratory tract you also produce another type called IgA. This is secreted into the tract. Also, there is a dferent T-lymphocyte response when you are infected directly there. So, vaccination in the arm will not necessarily stop you getting COVID because your vaccination doesnt activate the IgA production sufficiently. Furthermore, for your immune system to activate against COVID, you have to produce some of the virus and its antigen. This would make you test positive by PCR, which is very sensitive, and probably by lateral flow. Thus, the problem is thatyou get COVID, even mildly, then you would have to isolate for ten days, and this would spoil Christmas again. We can’t risk this. That is why Penarth Bridge Club will close until th January . But here is an interesting hand from last week where the challenge for North South was to bid a slam. But which one – six hearts or seven clubs The AuctionSouth opened the auction with his five-card heart suit. North with fteen points knows game must be on, and maybe a slam. So, he bid two clubs. South felt his hand was strong enough now to reverse, keeping his support for clubs till a later bid. North was tempted to jump to four hearts but this might prevent them reaching a slam. So, he bid three hearts, knowing his partner would bid on after his reverse bid of two spades. Indeed, South now needed to show his support for clubs and so bid four clubs. North now bid four no trumps, Roman key card Blackwood. They were playing   so South’s response of five diamonds must show three key cards with clubs as trumps. North now could see seven clubs must be on, as South’s key cards must be the ace of spades, the ace of hearts and the king of clubs..removeThe playTrick  – East led the queen of diamonds, declarer winning the trick with his ace of diamonds, discarding a spade from dummy. Trick  – North considered the hand. Was he going to take the spade finesse  In fact,the hearts were   or   then he could discard his losing spade on the final heart. But trumps first. He played the ace of clubs from his hand. Trick  – He followed this by winning the next trick with dummy’s king of clubs. Good news. The defenders trumps were  , so he would not have to risk taking the spade finesse. Tricks ,  and  - Declarer then won the next three tricks with his king and queen and dummy’s ace of hearts. Trick  – He then ruffed a heart in his hand, establishing dummy’s last heart as a winner. Trick  – Declarer then ed to dummy by ruffing a diamond. Trick  – He then played dummy’s winning last heart, discarding the two of spades from his hand. Tricks  and  – He then played the ace of spades, followed by a small spade which he ruffed in hand. Trick – Declarer then ruffed his last losing diamond with dummy’s last trump. Tricks  – Declarer then claimed the last trick with his remaining club, the grand slam making with thirteen tricks for score of  - one spade, four hearts, one diamond, two diamond ruffs in dummy, and five clubs in hand. Well bid and well played. Six hearts makes but not seven, because East held four trumps.What have we learnt . It is often a good idea to show your partner a strong hand by reversing, as here, before showing support for his suit.. Once again Roman key card Blackwood.is an essential part of your armoury to reach a slam.. Always checkyou can establish small cards in a suit by ruffing before considering a finesse.Penarth club resultsFriday  December . Trish Tracey and Tony Campbell. Jim Elder and Meryl Skipper.

It is challenging health systems and service delivery in many countries where Omicron has spread and threatens to overwhelm in many more.”Dr Kluge added: “The key message is that every inidual should do everything possible not to get infected in the first place.”Asked about whether Covid- is moving to an “endemic” stage, Dr Catherine Smallwood, senior emergency officer at the WHO Regional Office for Europe, said: “In terms of endemicity we’re still a way off.“Endemicity assumes that there is some stable circulation of the virus at predictable levels and potentially known and predictable waves of epidemic transmission.“But what we’re seeing at the moment, coming into , is nowhere near that – we still have a huge amount of uncertainty, we still have a virus that’s evolving quite quickly and posing quite new challenges.“So we’re certainly not to the point of being able to call it endemic.“It may become endemic in due course, but pinning that down to  is a little bit dficult at this stage.”The Region saw over  million newly reported cases of COVID- in the first week of , more than doubling over a two-week period.As of th January,  countries report that over % of their population is catching COVID- each week @hans_kluge— WHO EuropeJanuary , She went on: “All of this, of course, depends on how we respond to it, and widespread vaccination uptake and on an equitable basis will be very, very key in moving towards such a scenario, and we’re still a way off that.“At the moment, the conditions for endemicity are not being met. The virus is not settling into a stable rate of transmission, and there’s still a lot of unpredictability… We hope to see that very soon rectied but it will very much depend on the actions we take collectively across Europe and across the world.”Meanwhile, Dr Smallwood suggested that Omicron is not milder than Delta.She told the briefing: “The reason we’re seeing a lot more milder infections across Western Europe and Israel is because of the high vaccination uptake in our population.“That immunity is basically meaning that we’re able to tolerate, from a public health perspective, a higher degree of infection in the population.“And, as much as we can tolerate that higher degree of infection in the population because of the vaccine coverage, we cannot necessarily tolerate the disruption that that’s bringing to our critical services.The overall risk related to Omicron remains very high:⃣ The global risk of #COVID remains very high overall⃣ Current data indicate that Omicron has a signicant growth advantage over Delta, leading to rapid spread in the communityhttps:t.co FkMbaAiB pic vmWZFLYCfQ— World Health Organization January , “We cannot predict the same milder resurgence of cases, and we’re yet to see how Omicron will pan out in a situation where there are more people susceptible and immunologically naive, and that’s where we need to hold our guns, be very cautious and not jump to any conclusions about changing the strategy and letting Covid spread – that would be a grave mistake.”On reports of a so-called Deltacron iant, she said: “ reports of a recombination between Delta and Omicron iants, and indeed we are in touch with Cyprus, who have been providing information about that.“And it does at this stage look like it could be the result of laboratory contamination rather than a new iant or new recombination between two iants.”Dr Kluge said WHO Europe advice encouraging people to take up an offer of a booster jab is not contrary to international WHO statements which have called for initial vaccinations to be prioritised over boosters.He added that lockdowns and mandatory vaccines should be “tools of the very last resort”..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Covid-  unot yet endemic u  u WHO article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I can think of about two or three where I’ve got to them thinking ‘this is a really good wicket’.“So, it’d be tough for me to find somewhere maybe a bit flatter.

The scheme will extend from Church Place up to Malcolm Road inclusive of side streets William Street, North Street and Edward Street.Upper Bann MLA Dolores Kelly said: “I look forward to seeing work commencing on this project next week that will result in much improved lighting for our community. This £, investment from SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon will make things safer for people living in this area and everyone who travels through it.“Whether travelling by car, cycling or just walking the improved lighting will result in a much improved experience and visibility and will hopefully help to lower accidents and discourage anti-social behaviour in these areas.“This investment once again demonstrates SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon’s commitment to tackling the climate crisis and delivering for local people, with the new LED lighting being more environmentally friendly, as well as more efficient.“I would urge road users to be patient while working is ongoing and to leave additional time for their journeys in case of any delays. I am assured the department is working to keep disruption to a minimum, with the work set to be completed by mid-Feburary.”DUP Cllr Stephen Moutray with Upper Bann MP Carla Lockhart in Lurgan, Co Armagh.Upper Bann MP Carla Lockhart said: “This is a very welcome investment and will see the installation of LED street lighting across Lurgan town centre. Not only will this modernise the street lighting infrastructure in the town, but it will also see our street lighting become more energy efficient. That is good news for the ratepayer but also the environment.“This investment is signicant, and it is inevitable that some disruption to the town centre will occur. I am grateful to the Department that they have recognised the need to minimise disruption for traders and for those visiting the town centre to shop and conduct business.”Alderman Stephen Moutray added: “Modernisation of town centres is vital to enhancing the experience of those who shop, work and live in our town centres and this will certainly assist in the transformation of Lurgan.“The DUP will continue to press the NI Executive Departments and local Council for further such investment in Lurgan and other towns and villages in the area.”Read this: Backlash after Portadown FC sign Joe Gorman: Fans vent over tweet eight years ago about Orange OrderWorkNichola MallonSDLPCarla Lockhart  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularTributes to young Co Armagh footballer Jamie Hoye who died s...NewsBacklash after Portadown FC sign Joe Gorman: Fans vent over ...NewsAngle grinder used during break in at Craigavon shops after ...NewsDelays expected during Newtownabbey works...News Rare Breed farming families to meet as popular UTV series...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":null,"title":" rare breed farming families to meet as popular utv series returns ","story":"Portadown man Lee speaks of dealing with grief a year after his we Jadedied from cancer   Public thanked as missing person Daniel Benson is locatedNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPeopleLibby Clarke, a mum-of-two from the Mageralin area, rears award-winning beef Shorthorn and Charolais with her daughter Lucy.

Members were informed the council will be launching an online survey to judge where or , there is enough interest in providing the borough’s citizens with allotment space.The survey will run for a period of eight weeks and once completed, officers will provide councillors who sit on the committee with options on how best to move forward on the matter.Speaking at the meeting, Alliance Party Councillor Eoin Tennyson said he would be delightedthis process resulted in an enhancement of allotment provision in the borough.An online survey is to be carried out to seetheres a demand for allotment space.“It is great to see the online consultation coming forward to determine what the demand is in the community,” he said.“I know allotment projects have been successful in other parts of Northern Ireland and there are good private providers here so it would be fantastic , out of this process, we could enhance our own provision or even have better partnerships with those providers in the borough.“That would be really positive for those in the borough who want to grow their own food.”Ulster Unionist Party Councillor Julie Flaherty told the chamber she believed there would be strong demand for this service.An online survey is to be carried out to seetheres a demand for allotment space.“I suspect there will be a huge interest in these allotments,” said Cllr Flaherty.“In the centre of Portadown there is a vegetable group, the group attached to that has  members and some of them are growing at home and learning how to use what they grow.“Recycling, composting, you name it, there are over  members there in the centre of Portadown. That is a good gauge of the level of interest and we are very proud of the guys at sustain who have worked very hard over lockdown too.”Speaking after the meeting, Cllr Tennyson continued to speak highly of the proposal and noted the strong demand for allotment space in other council areas.“Community allotments can have a positive impact on mental health and wellbeing, and on the local environment,” said Cllr Tennyson.“We have some fantastic allotment providers in the borough. However, there is clearly huge demand and it would be fantastic to see greater council support for existing providers and potentially even some new council-owned sites.I first raised the issue of allotment provision at committee in September. It’s fantastic to see progress on the matter. The proposed survey will be good news to many local residents who wish to grow their own food but don’t currently have access to appropriate facilities.“Information presented at committee clearly highlighted the popularity of allotments in other areas with both Antrim and Newtownabbey and Mid and East Antrim Council, with some having waiting lists of five years or more.“Once the online survey has been completed, Council will analyse the results to determinethere is demand additional allotment provision and put plans in place to meet that demand.”Craigavon Borough CouncilBanbridgeArmagh CityUlster Unionist Party  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularTributes to young Co Armagh footballer Jamie Hoye who died s...NewsBacklash after Portadown FC sign Joe Gorman: Fans vent over ...NewsAngle grinder used during break in at Craigavon shops after ...NewsDelays expected during Newtownabbey works...News Rare Breed farming families to meet as popular UTV series...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1641825999968.jpg--covid_19___mon_10th_january_figures.jpg?164182600000","title":"covid  mon th january figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.
