For France, last week’s starting centre Jonathan Danty has been ruled out and so Yoram Moefana, who impressed off the bench versus Italy comes into the 12 shirt. Up front, back row François Cros starts in place of Dylan Cretin who drops to the bench.  Andy Farrell has lost his captain, Johnny Sexton, and is forced to start Joey Carbery and bring Jack Carty onto the bench where he is joined by the fit again Robbie Henshaw. In the absence of Sexton, captaincy novice James Ryan will take the role in perhaps the most high-profile situation imaginable. Not ideal. Not so long ago these two sides were handily beating the All Blacks, and comfortable victories in round one of the tournament have shined up their credentials as pretty much joint-favourites for the title.  Ireland were irresistible last week as Andy Farrell’s brand of multi-phase, multi-pattern, fast and furious rugby dished out a whomping to Wales in Dublin. Even with the loss of Johnny Sexton more of the same will be expected here as Ireland seem to be a perfect blend of well-drilled with flexibility - a structure that should survive any personnel changes. Although, Sexton’s absence is definitely the change that will test that theory closest to its breaking point. France were more circumspect in a rain-sodden victory over an improved Italy in this stadium. However, this performance of such physically dominant pragmatism should also be admired alongside their much-touted capacity for magic from the Dupont and Ntamack. It’s impossible to call and I for one cannot wait to get going."},{"url":null,"title":"wales v scotland six nations 2022 live","story":"“That’s us in a nutshell, like for us, we want to be in a position to score tries, get ourselves in good positions. We were carrying with intent, we were carrying to score, and we got the outcomes we were looking for ... just at times we didn’t back it up, at times we didn’t get into the right positions. Look, credit to Wales, they were fairly good at times. “When you compound error on error, that’s when it gets a bit frustrating. That gave Wales field position and easy avenues into the game. That’s the frustrating part because we know we’re better than that. For us, we didn’t get too carried away with ourselves ... it’s bitterly disappointing at the moment ... we’ll look to get better. It’s a horrible feeling right now but that’s test match rugby.”McLaughlan points out that perhaps Liam Williams thought the winning drop goal was the wrong option with space out wide: “Quite possibly, but I couldn’t care less at the minute ... just so glad to have scored more points than them. We put a huge shift in defensively, uur forwards fronted up ... The maul was excelllent, and it laid a really solid foundation for us. Absolutely thrilled ... really pleased for the team, for myself, and for Jon Davies who was on the 100 as well.” The forwards? “Immense. The rolling maul was a huge thing for us all day. Got us out of trouble, allowed us to gain territory and gain easy yards ... this team, if it’s anything, it’s resilient and it knows how to hit back.”Dan Biggar has just said that is one of the best wins in his 100 caps for Wales. Full quotes to follow ...Cameron Redpath is on for Duhan Van Der Merwe.Callum Sheedy replaces a limping Dan Biggar after the Wales captain finds touch deep in Scotland territory.The upshot of all this is that Wales have the ball in the Scotland half, three points up, with four minutes left.Scotland have a lineout just outside the Wales 22 to attempt a strike back.The TMO and ref and now deciding whether Russell’s knock-on was deliberate.

They are both back on their feet and running it off.Russell tees it up and slots it. Scotland replace their front row: George Turner, Rory Sutherland and Zander Fagerson are on for Pierre Schoeman, Stuart McInally and WP Nel.Wales much improved from Dublin, particularly around the breakdown. To give Pivac his due, he did pick more of ruck focused backrow and it’s paying off thus far. Owen Watkin is also showing up well in the 13 shirt. That said, it’s difficult to shake the feeling that if Scotland can just secure possession more consistently this is their game. The visitors’ attacks, like against England last week, are more incisive, particularly on first phase. Finn Russell needs to kick for territory and bit more and let the Scottish defence contain Wales in their own half, if that happens Townsend’s men should end the 20-year Cardiff hoodoo.Biggar misses the conversation. Finn Russell makes no mistake.Dan Biggar calls for the tee again and reduces the Scotland lead. Russell misses the conversion from way out left A few passes later in the Scotland half it breaks down but it looks like it was caused by a deliberate knock-on by Hogg.

However, I think Moriarty can be used as an option, we’ll see.Scotland captain, Stuart Hogg, has much to trouble him regarding trips to Cardiff with his team. Read all about how he’s dealing with it here... In the backs, Owen Watkin and Alex Cuthbert return, while the pack sees a debut for Osprey Jac Morgan at 6 and Ross Moriarty replaces Aaron Wainwright at No 8. Centurion-cap man Jonathan Davies returns on the bench. Gregor Townsend surprisingly makes five changes to the team that beat England. Sam Johnson is jettisoned out of the 12 shirt and the squad entire, replaced by fellow Glasgow Warrior, Sione Tuipulotu. In the pack, there’s an entirely new front row with Pierre Schoeman, Stuart McInally and WP Nel swapping places from the bench with Rory Sutherland, George Turner and Zander Fagerson. Sam Skinner replaces the injured Jamie Ritchie in the back row. It says much for Scotland’s forwards depth that such changes register a barely negligible drop in quality. Let’s get the good news for Wales in early: Scotland have not won in Cardiff since 2002.  Moreover, since 2000 Wales have outscored today’s visitors by 36 tries to 14 in matches in the Welsh capital for a very comfortable average winning margin of 14 points. Even in Edinburgh the picture is not much better for Scotland, with the only win since 2007 for the boys is blue coming at Murrayfield in 2017 - the year Rob Howley was interim Wales coach with Warren Gatland on Lions duty. Given this, why do so many Wales fans have sad trombone music playing in their heads when they cogitate on today’s match? Probably because instead of reading historical stats, they are using their eyes and their minds to consider the evidence of the previous week and recent months on the pitch. Unlike in the numbers, there is little succour to be found there. Scotland arrive after a far more comfortable win against England than the scoreboard suggested with a settled and quality squad, while Wales were absolutely battered by Ireland in Dublin and have huge absences. Sure, Ireland look in very decent order at present, but leaving that aside there wasn’t much for Wales to focus in terms of positives as they looked lightweight and disorganised. But, Wayne Pivac has defied expectations before - his Scarlets team made the Pro14 final, and don’t forget he currently holds the Six Nations and Triple Crown trophies. This, plus whatever it is that Cardiff does to Scotland’s collective mentality maybe, maybe, enough to see an against form victory."},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examJunior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams to commence on Wednesday, June 8thThe fairness of some aspects of the college application system is open to questionMinister for Education confirms move for Leaving Cert and Junior Cert studentsSudden shift to pre-pandemic standards is not expected, says Department of EducationYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choiceThe Higher Education Access Route and Disability Access Route to Education schemes offer equitable access to higher education."},{"url":null,"title":"lifting of restrictions in ireland greeted as vindication by those who refused vaccine","story":" Dr Pat Morrissey: he says the move to vaccinate children from age five upwards has been ‘appalling’.  Photograph Liam BurkePress 22Nearly two years on from the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, Adare GP Dr Pat Morrissey, who did not give vaccines to patients in his Co Limerick\u0026nbspclinic, still believes the vaccine\u0026nbspcampaign was a lie, with money and greed at its heart.“It’s the greatest power-grab ever, the greatest consolidation of power and wealth ever,” says Morrissey, who insists that he is not against vaccinations but rather against those that are still experimental.Morrissey is one of the 250,000 adults in the State who chose not to get vaccinated despite restrictions, or\u0026nbspbeing blamed for spreading the virus, or for prolonging the epidemic.The January 21st lifting of almost all Covid-19 restrictions was greeted with bewilderment and anticipation by a weary vaccinated public, but it was also greeted as a vindication by those who refused to take the jab. Their stance has often put them in conflict with friends, family and employers.Breandán Murray (49), an IT project manager who lives in Dublin, was one of those unconvinced by the mRNA vaccine. He might be persuaded to get vaccinated if Novavax is released next year, a vaccine using an older technology.“I am not anti-vaccination, but I am anti the vax mandate. My wife has the vaccination, I drove her to the centre get it,” he said. “My reluctance to take mRNA vax is nuanced. My doubts grew as the rollout happened both for its effectiveness and the side effects.“Since I returned to Ireland from Belgium in August, I’ve found it hard to explain this to some friends – the issue has become so polarised. I was called an anti-vaxxer, and I took exception to that. I have my three children all vaccinated.”Locked awayDavid O’Neill (64) from Waterford has been vaccinated against most things, but similarly believes the mRNA vaccines are untested. “I was waiting for Novavax or Valneva but events have moved on,” he said.A chartered engineer, O’Neill said the unvaccinated were seen as a “dangerous minority”. A friend had sent out a group email saying the unvaccinated should be “locked away”, not knowing that he was one of them.Saying he could not make sense of the regulations, he went on: “The vaccines have had a beneficial impact, but the other side is what are the dangers of them? Nobody is actually giving any real assessment of the risk.”“There are very few journalists interested in hearing the opinion of people like me,” said Eamonn, a father of four from Kildare, who believes that his opinions are moderate, but never reflected during the pandemic.He, along with others who spoke to The , said the mRNA vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna, were untested technology, a viewpoint that is not shared by most people in medical science.Eamonn said he has neurosarcoidosis, an inflammatory condition of the brain, and is wary of taking the vaccine as a result. “Very little has been done in terms of research. The vaccines have not been around long enough.”John C*, a 41-year-old man living in Dublin, had a heart defect since birth and pericarditis in 2010. He too demurred on taking the vaccine for health reasons.“So I decided with a brand new vaccine it would be more sensible to wait three to five years before taking it as that would be enough time for accurate safety data to be compiled and published. By the way, this is the first time I have declined a vaccine in my life.”Second shotLaura*, a woman in her 30s who grew up in south Dublin and works for a multinational company, said she declined the vaccine as a result of her mother getting pericarditis after her second shot.Before the Covid pass was lifted, her wedding was in jeopardy because she was unvaccinated, but she would not budge.“I had Covid and recovered, it was two days of a bad flu. I have had pneumonia before and the pneumonia was a lot worse for me. I am pretty well read up on everything Covid. I have listened and read from both sides the last two years. Immunology 101 would say natural immunity always wins over vaccinated immunity. So why would I now get three injections for a virus I already had? I am not some anti-vaxxer, I regularly got the flu vaccine in work over the years.”Kevin*\u0026nbsp(30s), a gym trainer from north Dublin,\u0026nbspstressed that he was not against the Covid-19 vaccination, describing it as a “hugely helpful tool in reducing severity of outcomes for those most at risk from Covid”, but said\u0026nbsphe is young and healthy and saw no reason to take it.He never asked his gym clients for their Covid-19 passes and they never asked him for his.The Omicron-caused infections surge copperfastened his vaccination views. “It’s now January 2022 and I simply don’t see the benefit of getting vaccinated given my age and health profile. I am of no greater threat to anyone that is double vaccinated or boosted. We can all catch it, we can all spread it.”Lia, a 36-year-old scientist and PhD candidate based in the west of Ireland, is one of those who\u0026nbspcannot take the vaccine because of a reaction to polyethylene glycol, a component of the vaccine, which can lead to anaphylaxis.“I had to weigh up the risk benefits. We lost a family member in 1998 to anaphylaxis. I am not anti-vaccine. Myself and my partner are vaccinated for everything under the sun. I would have taken the vaccine if I could have done.“Honestly, it’s disheartening that people online push the narrative that there’s no medical reason not to avail of the vaccine. It’s simply untrue.”Her inability to take the vaccine came at a personal cost at Christmas when she was unable to take her children to see Santa Claus.LockdownA health researcher, who provides data for Nphet and is in her 50s, said she had come to the conclusion that the vaccines were useful for those in the vulnerable age category, but not for her.“You have to have evidence-based accountability. It was clear from early on who was at risk. I was never at risk. It was never backed by the evidence.“If all that money and focus was put on protecting the vulnerable we would be in a better place. The sooner we get rid of the masks the better. They were never supported by evidence either.”The unvaccinated still face limitations, especially on foreign travel which requires a recovery certificate, not an inconsiderable restriction. But otherwise they will be free to go about their lives.Nevertheless, the overwhelming feeling is relief. “To be honest I just want to forget about Covid now. I’m sick of being called an anti-vaxxer when I’m nothing of the sort,” says Bob*, an ultra-marathon runner.Back in Adare, Dr Morrissey insists that face mask rules in school should be dropped immediately.“How does this make sense? So, people can go to a nightclub and be close and personal with each other, while young children are stuck in school wearing masks for eight hours a day, impeding their learning, impeding their ability to learn and develop social and linguistic skills?”The move to vaccinate children from five upwards has been “appalling”, he says.“There is no benefit, zero benefit\u0026nbsp– what are they to gain from it, and you are depriving them . . . Omicron is the natural vaccine. I’ve had dozens and dozens of children I’m aware of who’ve got it – it’s a sniffle, it’s a high fever for one or two days and then they’re over it.“They are not going to get myocarditis, they’re not going to develop a heart attack, and we don’t have to worry about their future fertility.”TreatmentDr Morrissey is facing an investigation by the Medical Council for promoting and treating his patients with ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, which have been debunked by others as treatment for Covid-19.Defending his decision to use ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine as “early treatments”, Morrissey said the patients he has treated were those who had come to his door “looking for another way, and I offered them another way and none of them have died”.“They refused to take the injection that they were being threatened with literally every time they came near the door of a clinic or a surgery,” he says, declaring: “Albert Einstein said that blind obedience to authority is the greatest enemy of the truth, and I can see that they want to throttle the truth.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit uk signals it could accept checks on goods for northern ireland","story":"UK foreign secretary Liz Truss meeting European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic for talks in central London  Photograph: Rob PinneyPA Wire The UK has signalled it could accept customs controls on goods destined only for sale in Northern Ireland, its first significant concession during months of talks with Brussels over post-Brexit trading arrangements.Liz Truss, foreign secretary, wants to resolve the dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol - part of the EU-UK withdrawal agreement - which has soured relations between London and Brussels as well as convulsing politics in the region ahead of elections on May 5th.Ms Truss, who travelled to Moscow on Thursday for talks on Ukraine, believes Europe needs to work together to tackle the geopolitical crisis in the east. “Liz thinks western democracies need to work together,” said one ally.London has so far insisted that suppliers of products shipped from Britain intended for sale in Northern Ireland only should no longer have to fill in customs forms as dictated by the protocol.But British negotiators on Friday told their EU counterparts they could accept controls - though far fewer than under existing arrangements or reforms proposed by Brussels.The verbal offer was considered so sensitive it has not yet been provided in written form.The proposal came during Ms Truss’s third in-person meeting with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic, held in London. British officials said there was “a constructive atmosphere” at the talks.After the meeting the pair issued a joint statement, saying they agreed “on the need for progress in their talks in the interest of people in Northern Ireland, to stay in close touch and that officials will continue intensive discussions in the coming days”.Ms Truss’s team declined to comment but one ally said she had “put forward a series of constructive proposals to address problems created by the protocol” and to bring the two sides closer together. There was no single “offer” and the UK’s fundamental negotiating position had not shifted, they added.Under the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol, all goods going from Britain to the Northern Ireland must follow EU customs and health rules to avoid a trade border on the island of Ireland itself.However the Demcratic Unionist Party (DUP) pulled its First Minister out of the Northern Executive over its disputed contention that the trade border in the Irish Sea impacts on the North’s constitutional status within the UK.DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson’s has said his party would not renominate a First Minister following May’s elections unless there was progress in dealing with unionist opposition to the protocol.The commission in October had offered to create “red and green channels”, in which goods that were clearly destined to remain inside Northern Ireland, such as supermarket deliveries, would only need to provide a single customs form per load. London has now agreed to discuss this idea, but wants declarations to be even less detailed.The two sides have yet to make progress on the trickier issue of health checks on animals and food entering the region. The commission claimed its offer would reduce them by 80 per cent but the UK is unconvinced.Any customs agreement could be ratified by a meeting on February 21st of the Joint Committee, which manages the post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland. The talks are then expected to be paused during the election campaign.EU diplomats gave a cautious welcome to the UK proposal. “It’s a positive move but we are not rolling out the red carpet yet,” said one. “There is still a long way between the two sides.”Any concessions made during the talks with Brussels could anger Eurosceptic Conservative MPs, who dislike the protocol negotiated by Boris Johnson, the prime minister, because it puts a trade border in the Irish Sea - within the UK’s internal boundaries. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022 How is Brexit affecting you?

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireA new plan for how the country will deal with the Covid-19 pandemic will be mapped out in a forthcoming Government meeting, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said.Speaking at the One Ocean summit in Brest, France, on Friday, Mr Martin said he had held informal discussions with other heads of state at the conference and the picture around the pandemic was positive.“We’re going to have a meeting shortly, a Covid meeting within Government, just to try to take stock of the situation and map out the situation for the remainder of the year. And we just had a preliminary chat with some of the heads of state earlier this morning in terms of how things are going in their country,” he said. “The World Health Organisation seemed pleased with developments as were some of my colleagues.”Mr Martin said the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) will meet in the coming weeks to discuss the remaining restrictions including the wearing of face masks.He said, however, that it is his personal view that people should continue to wear masks on public transport and in retail outlets.“Nphet will be meeting in respect of the mask mandate and so on by the end of the month,” he said. “Irrespective of whether it is mandated or not, I would recommend that people would wear masks in retail and public transport for some time yet.“It’s a personal view I have. Decisions will be taken on the mandatory nature of masks if they are no longer necessary, they are no longer necessary and people will no longer have to wear them. “But we’ve learned lessons too from Covid and I think we need to adapt some of them. Particularly in the winter periods when viruses are stronger and more dangerous.”VariantsMr Martin said that, overall, “the news is good” in respect of the Omicron variant.“We have to be mindful of other variants. I think the emphasis now is to make sure we continue our investment in public health and that we have systems in place that are resilient and adaptable to any future outbreaks and maybe of other variants.”He said that was also the case in relation to the structures in place for future vaccination campaigns.“It also relates to the vaccination structures that we have so that we can respond again and are in a position, particularly towards the latter part of the year, in terms of vaccinating particularly the more vulnerable groups in our society. Niac is looking at that whole vaccination issue and whether or not we get to a situation where there would be an annual Covid vaccine.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"trade unions to press for significant pay increases amid rising living costs","story":"Coalition sources said there would be focus on actions that could reduce Government-controlled costs. The Government’s efforts to contain the turmoil sparked by the rising cost of living have run into immediate trouble as unions press for significant pay increases in the private and public sectors.Employers and Government are bracing themselves for a flurry of pay claims in the coming months as unions seek to boost wages in the face of rising inflation.The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (Ictu) said on Friday that it would advise private sector members to seek pay increases of up to 5.5 per cent, and indicated it would push for similar moves in the public sector once negotiations on a new pay deal begin, likely this summer.The congress, whose 15 affiliate private sector unions represent 400,000 workers, had previously called for a pay increase in a range up to 4.5 per cent. “Inflation devalues the value of somebody’s wage in their pocket,” said Ictu general secretary Patricia King, adding that workers should not have to pay the price for an inflationary spiral they did not cause. “I have no doubt that these issues on inflationary pressure will form part of the agenda to be considered by both the public unions and the Government as employer.”But Taoiseach Micheál Martin warned: “We have to be careful that we don’t try to chase inflation and then end up causing more harm than good.”Opposition supportOpposition parties immediately supported the Ictu move. Sinn Féin’s finance spokesman, Pearse Doherty, said his party supported the call to seek higher wages, while Labour’s finance spokesman, Ged Nash, said: “The pressure being put upon working people is immense and the reality is that Ireland needs a pay rise to cope with this cost of living crisis.”The Ictu move was not unexpected in Government, but there is a growing awareness that wage pressures are inevitable, and that this risks embedding inflation in the economy.Coalition sources said there would be focus on actions that could reduce Government-controlled costs, promote competition and assist more people into the labour market. One senior Government figure said cutting the cost of childcare would be a focus in the coming months.Business lobby group Ibec said many companies felt they were being hit “on the double” as costs rise with the introduction of statutory sick pay rights for all workers and other developments such as pressure to formalise remote working.“Ictu’s numbers in the mid-range are not out of kilter with the market but it’s the principle of wages chasing inflation is where the road to ruin happens,” said Ibec chief executive Danny McCoy.He added that “the idea that wages could compensate for cost of living is a bad precedent. Better that wages follow productivity and, where necessary, protect living standards.”Goodbody chief economist Dermot O’Leary said a round of pay claims could lead to inflation becoming “engrained”.“One-off, targeted reliefs are the appropriate policy response, but this will not stop employees and their unions using the high inflation rates and their current bargaining power for their benefit,” he said.The Taoiseach, who said he would donate his €200 energy credit to charity, told reporters at a summit in France there would be no further measures to tackle the cost of living until the October budget.On pay, he said there would be “further soundings” between the Government, unions and employers. “The biggest pressure at the moment is talent, there are a lot of vacancies now, particularly in the hospitality sector. The sector is saying to us that it is difficult to get people. That will create its own upwards pressure on salaries and wages.”Ms King wrote on Friday to Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, urging him to expand the “small benefits exemption” scheme in which employers can provide vouchers tax-free to staff. Ictu said the tax-free limit should be doubled to €1,000 from €500 a year for workers earning weekly gross wages up to €1,462, arguing that such a move could provide an additional €100 a month between March and December."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"ardern trudeau woke darlings western world finally getting comeuppance","story":"Who knew that empathy wasn’t enough? Two leaders who got to their positions by showing how much they can emote, how much they can feel, how much they care, now appear to be in the worst positions of almost any head of government in the democratic world.Take Jacinda Ardern, prime minister of New Zealand. Ardern has always achieved a degree of international fame far beyond that enjoyed by most leaders of her small nation because she is a woman and she appears to really mind. In fact caring is Ardern’s shtick. She is especially good at apologising for things she hasn’t done. Her face crumples, her voice breaks, and the world’s news organisations shout in chorus: “Here is what we need in a leader.”Sadly for the people of New Zealand, that isn’t quite true. Most of the world is emerging from the corona era. Britain, thank goodness, seems to be leading the way, and even recalcitrant countries such as the Netherlands are starting to realise that if the UK is back up and running, you can’t lock down your own people forever.Jacinda seems not to have got the memo. Last summer she notoriously locked down her country again after one man was found to have Covid in New Zealand. I wouldn’t have wanted to have been him. Now, even Australia, which has been one of the strictest, harshest, countries during Covid, has started to lift regulations. And New Zealand?Well, Ardern has announced yet another batch of regulations for her countrymen. New Zealand seems almost hooked on the stuff. The international media once again went doolally for Ardern when she gave a press conference announcing fresh lockdowns and saying that this meant that her own wedding was off. How much she seemed to care! How much her face crumpled as she talked of the plight of her countryfolk! How selfless she was even to cancel her own nuptials!What people should have said was that New Zealand’s prime minister had clearly become a mad person. There was no reason to do this performative caring. There was no reason to sacrifice the opportunity to get hitched. The rules were the problem, and getting rid of them should have been the priority.Instead, everyone got swept along, yet again, on an ocean of Ardern ardour. And on it seems this will go. What will come of New Zealand? Perhaps it will remain always stuck in the summer of 2020, never allowing anyone in or out. Those of us who once went there will tell of it to our grandchildren who will listen in awe to tales of this remote island people who voluntarily cut themselves off from the rest of the world.Or perhaps, if some recent opinion polls are any guide, New Zealand will soon tire of its caring prime minister. Facing a mounting economic crisis, support for Ardern’s party among New Zealanders appears to be collapsing.But it isn’t just Ardern who has this emoting, empathetic act. Perhaps the world leader in this shtick is someone with an even softer voice and even nicer hair: Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau.As time goes on it becomes clear that Trudeau really is the worst leader in the democratic world. His principal qualifications for the role were that he had been a primary school teacher and that his father had been prime minister before him.Other than that, he simply promised to do things differently, to be more empathetic, to emote more, to be more feminine and more understanding. Before lockdown, this manifested itself in international trips during which Justin did more costume changes than the cast of any West End show. But as the Covid era came, Trudeau, like Ardern, seemed to come into his own. He talked about the importance of caring, looking out for each other and other fundamental Canadian values.Unfortunately, if you do not happen to agree with the silken-haired premier, he will have zero time for you. In recent months, as the rest of the world has adapted to Covid, Trudeau seems to have boxed himself into a corner on the matter.In an effort to persuade the population to get vaccinated, Trudeau did everything he could to defame those who disagreed with him. This extended to him dismissing anyone hesitant about taking the vaccine as being (guess what?) racist, misogynistic and more. Trudeau had no evidence for any of this, but this is the modern way of excommunicating any person or group of people. Say that they are racist, misogynistic, homophobic, transphobes and you have successfully un-personed such people.Unfortunately for Trudeau, many Canadians can see through this playground antic and are not persuaded by it. Specifically, Trudeau found that his vaccine demands had riled Canadian truckers.There is no special reason why truck drivers (one of the most isolating professions in the world) should have to display vaccine passports in order to do their work. But Justin decided that they had to, or their livelihoods would come to an end.Gloriously, last month, thousands of truckers drove in convoy to Ottawa. As they arrived there for their protest, Justin decided to pretend he had a headache. Or rather he said that he had met someone who knew someone who had once danced with someone who had Covid. And so the prime minister was doing the reasonable thing and self-isolating.The truckers stayed. At present they remain in Ottawa. Officials have looked into how to criminalise them. They have even looked into criminalising the thousands of Canadians who gathered at the roadsides to show their support. The Ottawa police are now actually stealing the truckers’ fuel and other necessities in an effort to make the protest go away. But the truckers aren’t budging.There is no reason why Trudeau should not make peace with the truckers. Any more than Ardern should not start to walk back from isolating her island nation.But the problem is that when you have presented yourself as the most moral person in the land – the most feeling, the most understanding – and portrayed all your critics as Nazis, it is hard to move to ground we might once have called common. So there Justin is, like Ardern, holed up in a problem entirely of his own making.Empathy is an overrated trick in political leadership. It only gets you so far. Much more important are grit, capability, adaptability and expertise. Neither Ardern nor Trudeau have demonstrated any of these traits. And it is their populations who are suffering as a result. A leader might like to present themselves as limitlessly compassionate, but if you end up having neither compassion nor even understanding for the citizens of your own country, then “compassion” is the problem.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Putin blames Western \u0026#39provocation\u0026#39 for looming warPolice fire tear gas as anti-restrictions \u0026#39Freedom Convoy\u0026#39 enters ParisLiz Truss urged to impose sanctions on Dubai official over jailed British businessmenRussian invasion of Ukraine could come \u0026#39as early as Wednesday\u0026#39Seizing land to make way for solar farms could worsen ‘deep and troubling’ farming crisisWatch: Man shouts \u0026#39heil Hitler\u0026#39 and makes \u0026#39Nazi salute\u0026#39 at Jewish mother and childrenMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"children aged five 11 set offered covid vaccines","story":"Covid vaccines are set to be offered to children aged five to 11, The  understands.The Government\u0027s scientific advisers are understood to have agreed that the jabs should be made available on a non-urgent basis.Earlier this week, scientists said the UK was past the point at which vaccinating young and healthy children against Covid would make much difference.But new advice is expected shortly, suggesting parents should be given the option to have their children vaccinated and saying it could prevent a small number of hospitalisations. Rather than recommending that children be vaccinated, it is expected to set out a non-urgent offer to parents should they wish to take it up. It is likely to suggest the matter is something families may wish to consider in order to protect against a potential future wave of the virus.Families planning half-term holidays for next week have complained that the lack of jabs for under-12s has left them facing logistical headaches. The majority of countries in Europe are now introducing jabs for under-12s, and some holiday resorts have banned those who are unvaccinated.Spain on Friday announced that it would relax its rules from Monday to allow unvaccinated British teenagers to enter the country with a negative test.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has been ided about the matter for months, with arguments over whether the benefits of the jabs are sufficient to support their use in healthy young children.The committee is now understood to have recommended that jabs should be offered, although it was not clear on Friday night whether formal advice has yet gone to health officials.Just before Christmas, medicines regulators approved the use of a paediatric formulation of the PfizerBioNTech Covid jab, which involves a lower dose, for children aged five to 11. At the time, the JCVI only supported the rollout of jabs to those in this age group if they were clinically vulnerable or lived with someone who was immunsuppressed.Earlier this week, Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, suggested any decision now would come too late to affect the current wave of Covid.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme that infection rates in children are falling really quickly at the moment, adding: I think in many ways we\u0027re past the point where vaccines are actually going to make much difference.Prof Hunter said jabs were given to older children to protect them from disruptions to schooling, but added: We haven\u0027t seen that vaccines have actually done a huge amount to stop these interruptions, so I think the benefits are marginal and it\u0027s probably too late because most kids have already had omicron.In September, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, England\u0027s chief medical officer, estimated that half of children had had Covid – a figure that will now be far higher. The graph below shows the position by age group in November:Some parents have complained that attempts to plan holidays abroad have been made more difficult because Britain is out of line with other nations. While most will accept under-12s who are unvaccinated, some holiday and ski resorts will either not or will insist on tests, leaving parents facing logistical difficulties.Vaccines have already been rolled out to those aged 12 and over following a recommendation from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.In September, the JCVI said the margin of benefit was considered too small to support universal vaccination but Prof Whitty ruled in favour of the rollout in order to reduce disruption to schooling.  More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Putin blames Western \u0026#39provocation\u0026#39 for looming warPolice fire tear gas as anti-restrictions \u0026#39Freedom Convoy\u0026#39 enters ParisLiz Truss urged to impose sanctions on Dubai official over jailed British businessmenRussian invasion of Ukraine could come \u0026#39as early as Wednesday\u0026#39Seizing land to make way for solar farms could worsen ‘deep and troubling’ farming crisisWatch: Man shouts \u0026#39heil Hitler\u0026#39 and makes \u0026#39Nazi salute\u0026#39 at Jewish mother and childrenMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"john bercow weakest link goodbye","story":"Poor John Bercow.

Brady has not been keeping a detailed diary, unlike his predecessor, Michael Spicer, whose well received Spicer Diaries were published in 2013.“But I have been keeping some notes,” he tells me with a smile.Isn’t it time for some sort of honour for Michael Crick, whose new biography of Nigel Farage is garnering rave reviews?

Was our freedom not worth marking?Speaking of celebrations, it has been revealed that British taxpayers paid £700 for a leaving party last November for the BBC’s departing North America editor Jon Sopel and 86 invited guests at the British Embassy in Washington. Tory MPs are unhappy. Julian Knight, the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, asks: “Why are the public paying for a knees-up for a BBC journalist who is already paid for by the taxpayer – is it a case of ‘double bubble’?”A Foreign Office spokesman says: “Hosting events allows our embassies around the world to pursue the UK’s objectives. This is normal diplomatic practice.” A source adds that “English sparkling wine was served, paid for privately at no expense to the taxpayer”.Couldn’t Sopel – who was paid between £235,000 and £239,999 a year by the BBC in 2020 – pay for the whole thing himself?Andrew Lloyd Webber has clearly had enough of Covid.

The 18 gold-plated panels are not yet fully aligned, and are yet to fire on all cylinders.The first image, released by Nasa shows 18 white dots on the black background of space. However, these dots are all of the same object, a distant star.But because the 18 mirrors are not yet working in unison, they produce 18 inidual artefacts.Engineers will spend the next month fine-tuning the alignment of the mirror so the 18 images become one. “Launching Webb to space was of course an exciting event, but for scientists and optical engineers this is a pinnacle moment, when light from a star is successfully making its way through the system down onto a detector,” said Michael McElwain, Webb observatory project scientist at the Nasa Goddard Space Flight Centre in Greenbelt, Maryland.James Webb is designed to operate at frigid temperatures as it specialises in spotting infrared radiation, and heat is a source of interference.It will take several months before the machine cools to its desired -223C (-369.4F), and this ground-breaking initial photo was taken by NIRCam, one of JWST’s four primary instruments, the only one which can work adequately at warmer temperatures.We were so happy to see that light makes its way into NIRCam,” said Marcia Rieke, principal investigator for the instrument and regents professor of astronomy, University of Arizona.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Putin blames Western \u0026#39provocation\u0026#39 for looming warPolice fire tear gas as anti-restrictions \u0026#39Freedom Convoy\u0026#39 enters ParisLiz Truss urged to impose sanctions on Dubai official over jailed British businessmenRussian invasion of Ukraine could come \u0026#39as early as Wednesday\u0026#39Seizing land to make way for solar farms could worsen ‘deep and troubling’ farming crisisWatch: Man shouts \u0026#39heil Hitler\u0026#39 and makes \u0026#39Nazi salute\u0026#39 at Jewish mother and childrenMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"civil servants subvert sabotage ministers defying order scrap","story":"The Civil Service has defied ministers to keep mandatory “unconscious bias” training despite the Government scrapping it a year ago for being ineffective, The  can disclose.Ministers banned the ersity courses from Whitehall after an official review found no conclusive proof that they change behaviour or improve workplace equality in the long-term.Some 170,000 officials completed the training, which alerts people to their apparent hidden prejudices, at a cost of £370,000 to the taxpayer. MPs said that it only served to enrich woke consultancy services. It prompted the minister Julia Lopez to tell the Commons in December 2020: “Ministers have concluded that unconscious bias training does not achieve its intended aims. It will therefore be phased out in the Civil Service. We encourage other public sector employers to do likewise.”But more than a year later, it remains in operation across Whitehall departments covering thousands of staff, materials leaked to The  show. Now civil servants stand accused of efforts to “subvert and sabotage” orders from ministers, as furious MPs write to the Cabinet Office demanding it ends “this costly and undesirable kind of indoctrination”. The row centres on Civil Service Learning, the online portal for upskilling and training for civil servants. Unconscious bias training is included at least five times in an “inclusion in the Civil Service” course, which is listed as required learning. Officials are told they “must” complete four modules, one of which is titled “our inclusive workplace” with the description: “Learn about how stereotyping and unconscious bias can influence thinking and the impact this can have on work relationships and decisions.”In one section titled “unconscious bias”, civil servants are told: We all have biases that we bring to work every day. The important thing is to be mindful and aware of your bias. Then you can learn to manage it.”The current course, seen by The , adds: “If we all do this, we\u0027ll be able to appreciate the skills, talents and potential of others, and build a erse workforce … Often unconscious bias limits where we look for or how we value talent in different people.On Saturday, the Government admitted unconscious bias training remains in operation. A Whitehall source said: “It is deeply disturbing that the Civil Service ersity industry operates completely free from ministerial oversight — so much so that civil servants felt they could subvert and sabotage a commitment a Cabinet Office minister made to Parliament.”The course goes on to say that “there are four topics on unconscious bias in your mandatory learning”, one of which covers religion and ethics. A workplace scenario is provided of a Christmas tree being taken down because it causes offence. In the role-play, staff are told: Elaine, my manager, came up to me and told me I\u0027d have to take the Christmas tree down, as she was worried it might offend Aaron, who is Jewish and Mo, who is a Muslim. Another slide then says: Don\u0027t assume that everyone from a particular religious background practises their religion in exactly the same way.Sir John Hayes, the former minister, told The  he would be “writing to the Cabinet Office immediately, making sure that every Government department is told that if this is going on, it’s going on without ministerial permission”. The chairman of the Common Sense Group of 50 Tory MPs added: “There are clearly elements within the administration that haven\u0027t yet got the message. It is vital that no civil servant is obliged to endure this costly and undesirable kind of indoctrination.”“If this training wasn\u0027t sinister, it would be comic. It’s Fawlty Towers meets Whitehall, isn\u0027t it really? It is bizarre and preposterous. It also has a corrosive and corrupting effect because as every tyranny has recognised through time, if you tell blatant lies often enough, some people get conned into believing that.”Learning about unconscious biases was first made a requirement for all Whitehall staff in 2014, with online sessions provided for junior staff and face-to-face lectures for senior mandarins. Standalone modules were then added, which have since been removed.A review by the Government’s Behavioural Insights Team found that the training, also popular in the private sector and charities, “has been implemented even though some academic research and reports have highlighted the ineffectiveness, and even the negative effects”. The report warned of the potential for “backfiring effects” when participants are exposed to information that suggests stereotypes and biases are unchangeable.A Government spokesman said: “All standalone mandatory unconscious bias training was removed in December 2020 in line with ministerial direction.There are references to unconscious bias training within the range of legacy ersity and inclusion courses currently available to civil servants. We are in the process of updating all our ersity and inclusion offerings.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Putin blames Western \u0026#39provocation\u0026#39 for looming warPolice fire tear gas as anti-restrictions \u0026#39Freedom Convoy\u0026#39 enters ParisLiz Truss urged to impose sanctions on Dubai official over jailed British businessmenRussian invasion of Ukraine could come \u0026#39as early as Wednesday\u0026#39Seizing land to make way for solar farms could worsen ‘deep and troubling’ farming crisisWatch: Man shouts \u0026#39heil Hitler\u0026#39 and makes \u0026#39Nazi salute\u0026#39 at Jewish mother and childrenMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid nasal spray halves time test positive pcr test could available","story":"A nasal spray that halves the time for which a person tests positive for coronavirus after being infected could soon be available in Britain.Trials involving more than 300 patients found that the nitric oxide spray reduces viral load by 94 per cent within the first 24 hours after treatment, and more than 99 per cent after two days.On average, patients using the Nitric Oxide Nasal Spray (NONS) tested negative by PCR on day four compared to day eight for those on the placebo arm.The spray works by sending molecules of the antimicrobial nitric oxide into the upper airways where it can kill the virus directly. It is the same molecule used as a gas to treat persistent pulmonary hypertension, or blue baby syndrome, in newborn babies.It could be useful in helping to prevent the spread of coronavirus if self-isolation is scrapped at the end of February, and manufacturer SaNOtize is currently in discussions with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to bring it to Britain.The company believes that not only could it cut down infection but it may also prevent cases of long Covid, which have been linked to higher viral loads. If approved, it would be the only first-line defence product available in Britain.“The spray destroys the virus, blocks entry into the nasal cavity and halts replication of the virus, which rapidly reduces viral load,” said Dr Chris Miller, Chief Science Officer and co-founder of SaNOtize.“This is important because viral load has been linked to infectivity, poor health outcomes and complications from long Covid.“Amid evidence of waning efficacy for some vaccines and higher breakthrough rates, there is currently a lack of an antiviral therapy that is effective against Covid-19 and its variants that can be made widely and affordably available to the public.“This is what makes the spray a critical weapon in ending the pandemic and preventing future outbreaks.”The latest phase three trials took place in India, which has already licensed the product as FabiSpray, but phase two trials were carried out at Ashford and St Peter’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and Berkshire and Surrey Pathology Services.The tests were carried out while both delta and omicron were in circulation, thus the team believes it will be effective against both variants.The company is in talks with the MHRA to determine whether the spray would be marketed as a medical device or a treatment, and if it would be prescription-only or sold over-the-counter.In India, it is currently a prescription treatment, but can be bought over-the-counter in Israel. It is likely to cost around £15 to £20 in Britain.Dr Gilly Regev, SaNOtize Co-Founder and CEO said: “We look forward to this becoming the first line of treatment and, potentially, defence for Covid infection worldwide.”The latest trial data was released by the company this week and has been submitted for peer review.“As viral load is an important determinant of disease severity and transmission of Covid-19 infection, demonstration of reduction in the viral load is expected to have significant clinical consequences from a patient and community perspective,” added Dr Monika Tandon, Head of Clinical Development at Glenmark, the pharmaceutical company making the product.“In the current scenario, with new emerging variants exhibiting high transmissibility, this novel product provides a useful option in the world’s fight against Covid-19.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Putin blames Western \u0026#39provocation\u0026#39 for looming warPolice fire tear gas as anti-restrictions \u0026#39Freedom Convoy\u0026#39 enters ParisLiz Truss urged to impose sanctions on Dubai official over jailed British businessmenRussian invasion of Ukraine could come \u0026#39as early as Wednesday\u0026#39Seizing land to make way for solar farms could worsen ‘deep and troubling’ farming crisisWatch: Man shouts \u0026#39heil Hitler\u0026#39 and makes \u0026#39Nazi salute\u0026#39 at Jewish mother and childrenMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jacinda ardern turned new zealand hermit kingdom","story":"What shall I wear? How much should I pack? Who will meet me at the airport when I land? I’m coming to Britain this spring – but I might allow myself a quick nervous breakdown first.I’m Kiwi-born, with British citizenship. But planning a trip to catch up with friends and family in the UK never used to be such a big deal. That was before the advent of “Fortress New Zealand”, which has seen my country almost completely separated from the outside world for nearly two years now.Except for a brief, ill-starred travel bubble with Australia, my archipelago in the South Seas has been in the gulag ever since the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced a snap closure in the early weeks of the initial Covid wave.It has left politicians – including former prime minister Sir John Key – despairing at how our country has been turned into a “hermit kingdom”. But a hermit kingdom with newfound attitude, too, if the thousands of protesters who this week brought parts of Wellington, the political capital, to a standstill are anything to go by.Inspired by the recent “siege of Ottawa”, during which the Canadian capital was paralysed by truckers protesting against hardline lockdown measures, a “freedom convoy” of Covid protesters involving hundreds of cars, trucks and motorbikes converged in Wellington on Tuesday morning to demand the lifting of Ardern’s pandemic measures.Kiwis have had plenty of experience of lockdowns over the past 24 months, but widespread protest against the government in general, its pandemic policies in particular (the last three-month shutdown of Auckland, our largest city, was a doozy) and the country’s leader especially is a politically worrying development for a 41-year-old leader more used to uncritical approval both here and abroad.Though Ardern initially said at the start of the protests that she had no intention of engaging with protesters, she has clearly been in listening mode. She has now announced a phased reopening of the country’s borders – to vaccinated New Zealanders from Australia, from the end of February, and then to expats coming in from anywhere else from March 13.Tourists from Australia and other countries not requiring a visa (including the UK) will be permitted in by July incomers from other countries must wait until October.Though visitors will no longer be marshalled by the army into a requisitioned hotel for quarantine (as has happened with the relative few who made it into the country these past two years), 10 days of self-isolation will still be mandatory.Even Australia – which also closed its borders, and endured some of the world’s longest lockdowns under a similar “Zero Covid” policy – is easing up faster than us, allowing tourists in from later this month. And this is despite the fact that 77 per cent of Kiwis are fully vaccinated – more than most other countries, including the UK.Ardern, who has spent much of the past 24 months in media conferences urging her self-designated “team of five million” forward, gambled everything on an isolationist stance.Certainly, it has helped saved lives. Just 53 people have died here from Covid, and our prime minister has been lavished with praise as a result. For much of the pandemic, the team of five million went about their lives pretty much as normal, working maskless, travelling domestically and attending large outdoor gatherings underneath azure skies, going home in the evenings to wade through tear-soaked emails from contacts abroad marvelling at our apparent Covid success.But there has always been another team milling in the shadows, the team of one million, the expatriate Kiwis stranded abroad who have paid a heavy price for their home country’s Covid elimination strategy. On a per capita basis, New Zealand has one of the world’s biggest diasporas. The nation makes much of its bona fides as a stickler for international law and protocols, but Fortress New Zealand has been one of the few places not to allow citizens to return home as a birthright. Instead, intending returnees have taken their chances with a lottery system that has seen most applicants unable to secure a ticket.A group of more than 15,000 New Zealanders abroad are currently suing the Ardern government, claiming the strict border controls are a breach of their human rights. The case goes to the High Court later this month. In the meantime, the convoy of thousands protesting Ardern’s political leadership remains parked in the capital. Ardern’s measures have been quite ghastly, but shutting down the capital, as they effectively have, doesn’t seem an ideal way to let freedom ring.Thousands of hard-luck stories from abroad, many amplified on social media, have created much of the current momentum. Sinead Aldrich was one such case, a young occupational therapist who left New Zealand a few years ago for the great “Kiwi OE” (or overseas experience), the cultural rite-of-passage that typically consists of late nights drinking and dancing before one’s temporary day job beckons. (Had Ardern not benefited from as much back in the early Noughties when her own OE briefly took her into Tony Blair’s Cabinet office?)In the event, Aldrich found herself drafted in to care for Britain’s critically ill patients during the first Covid wave. Almost as terrifying, she said in a telephone call from London last week, was the reality of being effectively abandoned by her own government. “Knowing that home wasn’t even on the horizon literally broke me,” she says. “It was the first time I’d ever cried on the phone to Mum.”There have been severe economic and mental convulsions for those New Zealanders for whom interaction with the outside world is imperative. An industry survey of the all-important international tourism sector found ubiquitous reports of “stress, uncertainty, mental toll, fatigue, depression and financial concerns”. One restaurant owner in Auckland, which was locked down for months last year, tells me of having had to counsel two staff members out of suicide she has since closed shop permanently.But probably the biggest tipping point was the politically embarrassing case of New Zealander Charlotte Bellis, a pregnant reporter with Al Jazeera stranded in Afghanistan last summer, whose only offer of safe haven to have her baby came from the Taliban. Earlier this month, Bellis and her partner were granted leave to return to New Zealand – but the case has done lasting damage to Ardern’s image and approach. Now that the omicron variant has breached the fortress – Ardern admitted this week the wave of infection is likely to peak in March, with up to 30,000 cases a day – many are asking if the lonely path she chose for this country in the hope of eliminating the now-inevitable Covid outbreak was worth it. At a time when overseas governments are removing lockdown measures, New Zealand is set to face new restrictions, notably lengthy home-isolation periods for households and contacts of known cases. Ardern has also refused to rule out the prospect of future lockdowns. Four years after first leading her party to electoral victory, and 15 months since her second easy victory (New Zealand has a three-year parliamentary cycle), “Jacindamania” is not what it was. Neither is the once limitless reservoir of popular support she enjoyed. One of the first of the year’s major political polls showed the lead her government still holds over her conservative opposition survives – but has narrowed.“We’ve got a lot of work to do over the coming year,” Ardern admitted this week, even as many of her team has a lot of overseas travelling to organise. Now if you’ll excuse me, I also have some packing to do.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Putin blames Western \u0026#39provocation\u0026#39 for looming warPolice fire tear gas as anti-restrictions \u0026#39Freedom Convoy\u0026#39 enters ParisLiz Truss urged to impose sanctions on Dubai official over jailed British businessmenRussian invasion of Ukraine could come \u0026#39as early as Wednesday\u0026#39Seizing land to make way for solar farms could worsen ‘deep and troubling’ farming crisisWatch: Man shouts \u0026#39heil Hitler\u0026#39 and makes \u0026#39Nazi salute\u0026#39 at Jewish mother and childrenMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"second brush covid proof law ass","story":"I was supposed to be flying to Miami as you read this column, but on Wednesday I tested positive for Covid (again).One hundred and nine days on from my last bout and I got the dreaded double-liner on a lateral flow test, which was swiftly confirmed by a lachrymose PCR.It seems salty tears do little to dilute the effects of coronavirus.

There were two glaring figures published this week. The first was £ – the amount of profit BP made every second in the last three months of . The other was one million. That is the number of adults in the UK who went an entire day in the past month without eating because they could not afford to. The figures illustrate where we are as a nation. The wealthy have never been more prosperous while the poorest are turning in record numbers to foodbanks. On every measure the gap between the haves and have-nots has widened. In Britain between  and  the wealth of the richest .% doubled. One in five of the populationare now in poverty including over four million children.  While the collective wealth of the  billionaires in Britain rose % in the past decade to £.billion. The UK is a rich country but the wealth is not distributed fairly. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show the richest % of households hold % of all wealth. The poorest % own %. In the  years to  average earnings jumped %. From  to  they are forecast to rise .%. This was not always the case. Britain was far more equal in the s and s. Take, for example, executive pay. In  the bosses of the biggest firms earned  times more than the average worker.  Today it’s  times more, with the chief executives of the  largest firms earning £.m a year on average. How did we end up in this situation  And why is capitalism only working for a few and not the many  To understand how this great wealth ide came about we need to go back to the US over  years ago. An international agreement, the Bretton Woods accord, was reached in . The system, co-designed by British economist John Maynard Keynes, put controls on global finance. These controls were then ripped up by US President Richard Nixon in .  The economist Ann Pettor said it was a “catastrophic” decision, adding: “Before that, governments had come together and said ‘we are not going to allow countries to build up massive deficits and surpluses because that creates trade tensions’. Nixon says ‘let’s leave it to markets’. Of course, Wall Street was thrilled. This opened the way for deregulation.” And deregulation meant big business and very wealthy people could move money from one country to another to avoid paying taxes. The legacy of these rules includes the fact Amazon’s revenue in the UK in  was £.bn but it paid just £m in direct taxes. Money that should go to the Treasury is siphoned from this country to low tax states such as Luxembourg. It was also in the s that the US tore up anti-monopoly rules, and once America started dismantling the regulations on finance, Britain started to follow.  Business realised it was far more profitable to make money from money than from a tedious task like manufacturing, which needs labour. Light-touch regulation should have come to an end with the  financial crash when banks tumbled under the weight of the debts they had built up through speculative borrowing and over-expansion. In fact the reverse happened. Finance has boomed since the crash and inequality has widened. To keep the banks afloat and stop the economy from plunging into recession the Bank of England turned to quantitative easing.  It involves the Bank buying bonds from banks which then lend money to businesses and households. The Bank has bought £bn of bonds through this scheme, which helped the UK through the worst of the recession but handed money to those who already had it. Guy Hands, the boss of Terra Firma Capital, was very open about how he benefited, saying in BBC documentary The Decade the Rich Won: “The effects of recapitalising the economy in the way they did was the rich got richer. “If you plonk a whole lot of money into the system it’s going to end up [with] those who have got money. Those of us in private equity got incredibly wealthy.” Lord Prem Sikka, an accountant and academic, said QE did little to help ordinary people. He added: “Wages have barely exceeded pre-crash levels. “Even as stock markets gained from QE, it did not really benefit Brits. Only .% of UK-listed company shares are held by UK-resident iniduals.” Just as the rich were getting richer, George Osborne unleashed his austerity measures on the economy. Services were cut, wages were frozen and investment curtailed. Mr Osborne did find money to provide a tax cut for hedge fund managers. As private equity boomed, workers were the main losers. Explaining how private equity operates, author Nick Shaxson said: “They buy up companies then apply financial engineering to them. “It usually involves loading companies up with debt. The private equity moguls are not on the hook for this debt, it’s the companies they buy that are on the hook. They buy a company then tell the bosses ‘your company has to borrow £million’, then they say ‘pay that £million to us and we will spend it on yachts or whatever and you guys are going to have to pay back that loan with interest’.  “They have made a killing, there’s nothing productive about it at all. They might [also] run all its financial affairs through tax havens. It creates extra money for them [but] hasn’t done anything useful for the company. It just stfs taxpayers.” Britain’s weak union laws have only made this task easier. Covid has been a boom time for the private equity industry. It has snapped up supermarkets, vets, funeral parlours and care homes. Tory peer Lord David Willetts said: “The next generation should be better off than [us], that’s part of the promise of capitalism. But there is pessimism whether our kids will enjoy the same kind of increase in living standards that we enjoy. That’s why people are beginning to worry about capitalism.” Some economists say the answer is tougher regulation. But Britain is set to go in the other direction. A review is ongoing into the rules governing financial services to make them more “agile”. The fear is the changes will let capitalism’s ugly side flourish still further.

With the rollout of vaccines and booster jabs the UK has seen the outlook brighten and overall cases,deaths and hospitalisations have been downcompared to last week. It comes withBoris Johnsonexpected to set out a new plan on Living with Covid when MPsfrom recess on February .This includes scrapping the legal requirement for people to self isolatethey test positive for the virus.And in Wales it has been announced it will easeCovid rules on masks and vaccine passportsbut self isolation will stay.Now thereports that the Treasury wants to end free PCR testing by the end of March for most people and exceptions would include those in hospital or the highly vulnerable.Lateral flow tests could be still given out free or limited to those over  and the vulnerable, it is reported.Ending the free PCR tests is clearly appealing to Rishi Sunak ’s department with billions having been spent to ensure that the public can find out for freethey have Covid and so slow the spread of the virus.There is concern though among scientists that it may be too soon to ask people to pay for their own PCR tests which can be expensive. The UK Health and Security Agencywants the Government to keep providing free tests until at least the start of April.  But anothersource also said that the Government was going ahead with plans to avoid free PCR tests and would close walk-in testing centres with only home delivery options available. Boris Johnson has revealed he plans to end self-isolation for people who test positive for Covid a full month earlier than planned, and will confirm the exact date in a statement to MPs on Monday  February.The prime minister said: “It is my intention toon the first day after the half term recess to present our strategy for living with Covid. “Provided the current encouraging trends in the data continue, it is my expectation that we’ll be able to end the last domestic restrictions, including the legal requirement to self-isolateyou test positive, a full month early.”  No  said it was a major step and faster than other European countries, but added: We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. The Government is expected to publish plans to live with Covid after recess ends in the final week of February. The Covid winter plan published last September said free lateral flow tests would eventually be scrapped but no date has been set for doing so. Prof Tim Spector, the epidemiologist running Kingaposs College London’s Zoe Covid study, said: “This is more a political type of statement rather than a scientic one. There is some rationale to this and other countries are doing things similar, but it’s clearly a race for the Government to say that Britain is first.” Dr Stephen Grfin of Leeds University said: “Literally blinding ourselves by removing testing and isolation robs us of the most fundamental means of controlling the spread.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The TreasuryBoris JohnsonHospitalsPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In fact, Govewent further: “Unless government takes a lead then what we see is called the Matthew Effect: ‘To them that have, more shall be given’. And that is why we have to act.” In other words, us Tories want to be modern-day Robin Hoods, redistributing money and power from rich, over-subsidised southerners to less well-off areas.  Andthat sounded like patronising drivel, it was borne out by a Cabinet reshuffle happening at the same time, in which all the plum jobs went to well-off, middle-aged, southern-based, Johnson-loyalist males. As Angela Rayner put it: “Who said dull men don’t fail upwards ” A big winner was Johnson’s fellow Old Etonian Jacob Rees-Mogg, the prince of failing-upward males, who became Minister For Brexit Opportunities and copped a £, pay rise. What a message it sends to those beyond the M that a Lord Snooty clone who believes the North should be made to accept earthquake-inducing fracking against its will, and who dismissed the most senior Tory outside London, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, as “a lightweight figure”, is in charge of handing out so-called Brexit opportunities.What a message to everyone without a shares portfolio facing a cost-of-living crisis. You’re getting clobbered by our tax rises folks, but a multi-millionaire with a Grade II-listed London home, whose we’s ancestral pile, the -room Wentworth ­Woodhouse, is the UK’s largest private house, is getting a whopping pay rise.  The unfathomable rise of this anachronistic mediocrity sums up why this government has no intention of closing the gap between the haves and have nots. The man Tory grandee Alan Duncan called “a cheap nationalist” has ascended the greasy pole turbocharged by nepotism, elite schooling, cast-iron connections and a cut-glass accent. This is someone with no conception of hardship and a complete lack of empathy for the poor, who told Unicef it should be “ashamed” for donating funds to feed hungry kids in Britain, and accused the Grenfell Tower victims of lacking “common sense”. And Johnson didn’t sack him for that, just told him to hide under his nanny’s skirts for a month. He led the campaign to let his mate Owen Paterson escape punishment for lobbying to make himself richer which repulsed the nation and mired his boss in a sleaze row. Yet he’s rewarded with promotion to the full Cabinet. The man we saw sprawled across the Commons like Nero awaiting wine from a slave is the most powerful symbol of why the Tories will always be the Anti-Levelling Up party. Living proof that rather than act against the notion that “to them that have, more shall be given”, they fanatically endorse it.

While another Tory source reportedly said “a confidence vote would be on the cards straight away”the Prime Minister is slapped with a fine.And former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith saidthe PM does have to pay a fixed penalty notice “it would be very tough” for colleagues to continue backing him.

The PM is thought to have been at six of them. These include the bring your own booze event in the Downing Street garden and an alleged bash in his No flat. A Tory MP said: “Everyone is waiting for the police investigation and the [full] Sue Gray report to be released. “At that point the facts will be available, and it is that point when Boris faces the biggest risk.” It would need  Tory MPs to submit letters of no-confidence in Mr Johnson to force a vote. He would then be oustedmore than % of his party’s MPs want him to go.  It is understood one of his allies has said the police will need to be “very certain” Mr Johnson broke the rules before giving him a fixed penalty notice.

Simon Forster and Emma Schofield had planned a trip to Copenhagen but landed close to Paris just days before Christmas.After getting past the “shampoo police” at Manchester Airport, they had sprinted to their departure gate where they say Ryanair staff checked their passports and boarding passes, Manchester Evening News reported. The couple were ushered down some stairs and they headed to the only waiting plane on the runway. Simon said they tried to show their boarding passes to a member of the cabin crew who he claims said “oh don’t worry about it” and asked them to take their seats. It was only when they landed and were greeted with a cheerful bonjour at passport control that the couple realised they were in the French city of Beauvais -  miles from their intended destination.Ryanair says it is each passenger’s responsibility to ensure they board the correct aircraft and there are several apostouchpointsapos throughout the passenger journey which inform passengers of the aircraft’s destination - including a welcome PA on board. But Simon says he heard no such announcement in English. Simon is seeking an apology from Ryanair and has asked the company to reimburse his flights, hotels and taxis after being forced to fork out more than £ during his time in France.“The shock of landing somewhere near Paris when you’re supposed to be going to Copenhagen was ridiculous, he said. “I would like to understand how on earth this happened. The couple’s pre-Christmas adventure started on December , last year, when they arrived at Manchester Airport for an evening flight to Copenhagen and found it very busy. Some passengers were seen fainting, one customer witnessed mini stampedes and tearful travellers were left stranded when flights took off without them.Airport bosses apologised and said security queues had been “longer than we would have hoped” as a “signicant increase” in passenger volumes put the operation under “severe pressure”. Simon, who runs Leeds-based Robot Food, says he waited for more than two hours to pass through security. “The queue for security was absolutely enormous and we were all crammed in like cattle,” he said. “It seemed as though we were going to miss our flight. “As soon as we got there I said ‘we should have just got a train up to Edinburgh instead’. “When we got past the shampoo police we got out into the airport and there was the last call for Copenhagen. “It was already past the departure time so we just legged it to the gate. “We got there and three Ryanair staff askedwe were there for Copenhagen.”  Emma and Simon showed staff their passports and boarding passes and were ushered down some stairs. “There was a red plastic link chain directly ahead and to the right, so we turned to the left and to the plane that was there, he continued. “We got on and there were only about six other passengers, which was not surprising because so many people were missing flights. “I did show the stewardess my boarding pass and she said, oh, donapost worry about it. I was dripping in sweat. “Our seat numbers were free so we sat down. “We landed in less time than we expected and as we walked into the airport I thought I didn’t recognise it and I go to Copenhagen quite a lot. “We were greeted at passport control with aposBonjourapos and it became apparent that we were in France.” Emma and Simon had landed in Beauvais, a city about an hour outside of Paris. Simon added: “We went through security and found a guy who spoke English who told us where we were. “He was heading into Paris so we askedwe could share a cab. “It was now after pm and France wasnapost letting UK travellers in from midnight so we were advised to book a hotel quickly. I had no G so one of my colleagues booked us into a hotel near the Efel Tower for the evening.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

He was told to fill in an online complaint form - which he did on December . The couple stayed in France for the weekend and booked flights home to the UK with Easyjet. “We had a lovely weekend and on the way back we kept getting messages from Ryanair about theCopenhagen flight being delayed, he said. Since ing home, Simon has tried to speak to RyanAir several times to complain and to seek reimbursement of his flights and the costs incurred. He says he spent €, on the original flights to Copenhagen and a hotel in the Danish city, a taxi from Beauvais, a night in a Paris hotel andflights from France to the UK. “After spending hours calling Ryanair and filling in online forms, my complaint is showing as ’solved’,” he said. “I was told on Monday that I would be contacted in three days. TodayI called again and someone hung up on me.” Simon says his colleagues have joked that the scenario was like the plot of the film Home Alone : Lost In New York - in which lead character Kevin McCallister ends up separated from his family on a flight to the Big Apple. “It really was a s*** show,” Simon summarised. “Just the fact we tried to show our boarding passes and were told ‘don’t worry about it’, You wouldn’t think that could happen these days. “If you put passengers on the wrong plane to the wrong country, you expect an apology.” Ryanair did not provide a comment, but for background stated: It is each passenger’s responsibility to ensure they board the correct aircraft. There are several touchpoints throughout the passenger journey which inform passengers of the aircraft’s destination, these include: Flight number and destination are clearly printed on the passenger’s boarding card Flight number and destination are displayed at the gate Flight number and destination are called out in the standard boarding PAFlight number and destination are mentioned in the welcome PA on board.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EasyJetRyanairManchester Airport\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Boris Johnson told MPs this week that he expects to end all restrictions, including the requirement to self-isolate following a positive test, this month – weeks earlier than scheduled.Covid restrictions had been due to expire on March , but Mr Johnson told MPs he expects they can end a month soonerthe data continues to be encouraging. It means in just over two weeks England could be ed to levels of freedom enjoyed before the pandemic, for the first time since restrictions were brought in almost two years ago. But the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieshave warned lting all restrictions will have a “disproportionate impact” on vulnerable people. In minutes from the group’s meeting on Thursday, members warned: “Increased ambiguity about a requirement to self-isolate upon testing positive will also disproportionately impact vulnerable sections of the population.” They also raised concerns about the consequences of removing access to free testing and called for “clear and consistent” messaging to the public about the ongoing risks.

Now the pair are back behind bars after being jailed for their latest crime last month. Police quickly established who the suspects were and arrested OaposDonnell and Hannay shortly afterwards.Enquiries later revealed that a second aggravated burglary had taken place where the occupant sustained an injury. O’Donnell and Hannay, , both pleaded guilty to two charges of aggravated burglary and one charge of  imprisonment.They were remanded in custody and were sentenced at Worcester Crown Court on February . OaposDonnell received a seven-year jail term, while Hannay was jailed for eight years. It is not the first OaposDonnell has made headlines.  In June last year, she was named by cops as she was wanted for recall to prison while awaiting sentencing for stealing a car. She was facing a prison term in November  after pleading guilty to taking a car without the owner’s consent, driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence and driving without insurance. The court heard how OaposDonnell, who was pregnant at the time, had a long history of drug and alcohol misuse. Her lawyers at the time argued that OaposDonnell was the victim of domestic violence. Last February, Anthony Hannay, also went on the run - but was eventually found hiding in the attic of a house in Worcester.Whilst on the run, Hannay appeared to be taunting officers by posting comments on the Facebook appeals West Mercia Police was making in their bid to find him.Someone using his name goaded them, with comments like: Catch meyou can and Just cooking my steak so come after.

While coming back from the toilets, some youths standing on a nearby balcony allegedly fired a small metal pellet from an air gun, which struck the child.Joanne said Lillie-Maiaposs cheek was left red and inflamed, just an inch below her eye, reports Lancs Live. They were on a day out with the girlaposs godmother and her daughter to take part in craft sessions - due to it being the first Saturday market of the month - when the incident occurred.  The group went for lunch at a cafe just outside the markets and Lillie-Mai was on the way back from the toilets with her godmother when she was shot. Joanne, from Whitworth, said: Next thing I heard was a lot of shouting and I recognised the voice of my friend. Next minute my daughter appears at the table, holding her face, crying, sobbing her heart out and sheaposs going, aposmummy Iaposve been shot in the face, Iaposve been shot in the faceapos.

Joanne said: What weighsapos on my mind heavily, and Iaposve to got to be thankful it wasnapost, but an inch higher, sheaposd have lost her eye - it was a metal ball bearing. That night Lillie-Mai woke up an hour after going to bed and was screaming, she was shaking, she started vomiting, her mum said. The next day she point-blank refused to leave the house and Joanne said she had a battle to get her to go to school on Monday. It has signicantly affected her, she added. Joanne rang police over the incident and officers are now investigating. The mum has issued a warning to the parents of the youths, saying she wants the culprits to know of the great trauma theyaposve inflicted on her little girl. Hyndburn Police has also issued a warning to parents over the dangers of the weapons and said this sort of behaviour will not be tolerated. A spokesperson said officers were called to the market hall on Saturday, February , at around pm to reports of youths with BB guns running around. Officers have since seized the gun and pellets they believe are linked to the incident with Lillie-Mai.

As reported last week, Greggs has teamed up with Primark for the very first time on a unique cafe experience and clothing range. The collab feels like a long overdue fit for the two high street legends, with Nottingham-based interior designer Philip Watts bringing a fun and energetic feel to whataposs been described as the most ‘Instagrammable Greggs in the world’.The doors to Tasty by Greggs officially open in Primarkaposs giant flagship store on Saturday, February . However, I was fortunate enough to get a sneak peek ahead of the launch, and feel I can now at long last officially add the role of apospasty influencerapos to my CV.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Although the Tasty by Greggs cafe is far more than just your average Greggs, the menu will be very familiar to all Greggs fans, with all your favourite treats present and correct - nothing brand new or dferent being sold here.Seems a bit of a shame they didnapost decide to create a limited-edition Primark-themed doughnut or something with bright neon colours to match the playful interior. With nothing new on offer to tantalise my tastebuds, I opted for a trusty vegan sausage roll followed by a sugar strand doughnut, all washed down with a vanilla latte from the quirky self-serve coffee cart. Although I know not everyone is keen on self-service coffee, I personally enjoyed this aspect of the restaurant, which really does enhance the relaxed feel of the place. I can absolutely imagine nipping in for aposjust one coffeeapos before staying for three. As big as the cafe and host store are, the sausage rolls and doughnuts were unfortunately standard-sized, which was, admittedly, another small disappointment. However, it does mean thereaposs always room to eat more!  Being Northern, Iaposm more than happy queuing up at small Greggsapos chains during hurried lunch break runs. However, Tasty by Greggs brings a completely new dynamic to the beloved bakery experience that I didnapost even know I needed in my le until now.You will also still very much feel like you are in Greggs, albeit Greggs when looked at through an influencer-worthy Instagram filter. Tasty takes things to the next level, seating as many as  people in a spacious and above all very chilled-out space. However, despite its size, Tasty doesn’t have the sort of impersonal, hectic feel that a lot of large high street cafes have. Divided into distinct sections, Tasty has a fun, home-from-home feel, and you can absolutely imagine flopping down here with your shopping bags to st through new purchases at your leisure. Those wanting a summery feel in drizzly February can park themselves in the light and airy Greggs picnic area, which is fitted with picnic benches well-suited to weekend catch-ups over brews. Meanwhile, selfie lovers will be in their element, with the most ‘Instagrammable Greggs in the world’ certainly living up to its name.My personal favourite feature was the cute sprinkle doughnut swing, surrounded by neon signage and tailor-made to show off your latest Primark haul.I can imagine this will prove popular, so Iaposd definitely advise grabbing yourself a seat at one of the nearby half doughnut booths while you wait for it to free up.  Much like the chain thataposs kept Brits coming back again and again since , Tasty offers a friendly, welcoming experience, all while bringing something a little new and vibrant - itaposs the perfect accompaniment to any serious Primark shopping spree. Tasty by Greggs will open at Primark’s Birmingham store at . am on Saturday, February , and can be found between men’s and ladieswear on Primark’s - Mezzanine floor.

Todd Scanlon, , was offered an apprenticeship by a company four years ago and has since impressed with his eagerness and professionalism. He has also recently been accepted onto a course to gain his qualications. Proud mum Vicky Scanlon praised his boss Martyn Coles for giving her son a chance. She said: “You’ve helped Todd achieve so much – physically, mentally, passing courses and getting awards.”  Todd was hired by Coles Scaffolding in October  and quickly became a valued worker. Speaking after joining, he said: “I mainly do a lot of fittings and carrying. I wanted to go into scaffolding because it’s my favourite thing to do.” Todd was later named the UK’s top apprentice and Martyn said he has no regrets about hiring him. He explained: “Having him on the site is great, he’s a good presence, all of the customers like him. He comes in every day and proves people wrong.” Vicky said Todd’s success story highlights the dficulty people with disabilities can have finding employment. She added: “When Todd was growing up you get used to the idea he won’t have the same le as everybody , but with Martyn doing this for him he’s getting there.” Todd, from Swindon, Wilts, works alongside five colleagues and his role involves ensuring the scaffolding is safe and level. Martyn’s firm has adopted the slogan “No Stigma” to show Todd’s disability does not hinder him. Martyn said: “We want to show he can do it. Everyone is entitled to work.

The resident watched the incident on his home CCTV camera at around noon last Friday , reports North Wales Live.He was in the bathroom of his three-bedroom home when he heard a knock at the door, followed immediately by the sound of the door handle being turned by the driver in question. The man, who wished to remain anonymous, said: I just think itaposs unusual. The Hermes delivery man pulled outside my house with a parcel, he walked up the drive, knocked the door, and then immediately pulled on the handle. I know what sound my front door makes when someoneaposs trying to open it. I was upstairs at the time in the bathroom and it was a bit of a shock.Have you had a similar encounter  Let us know at webnews@mirror He then ran from the bathroom to tell the driver to leave the parcel at the door. The resident added: I stuck my head out of a window to tell him. Iaposm not sure whether they should be doing it or not but it could be quite frighteningit was an elderly person living by themselves.  He added that the driver had his hood up which made it look like he was trying to hide [his] identity. He said: I sent a complaint to Hermes and they told me that the driver thought we had a porch and that he was trying to leave the parcel in it [a designated safe place]. However, the resident claried that they donapost have [a porch] and the door opens into [their] living room. EvenI did have a porch, I wouldnapost want people letting themselves in, he said. A spokesperson for Hermes said: We have raised this with the local team who have spoken to the courier involved. This was a genuine mistake as the courier believed it was a porch - we will ensure it wonapost happen again.

Carl, who is based at the entrance of the retail park, is refusing to move however, reports Wales Online.Whose side are you on  Have your say in the comment section Iaposve lived in Brynmawr my entire le and have always worked in food and catering businesses because itaposs what I love to do. I donapost know how to do anything  to be honest with you and for me this van really is my livelihood and the way I support my family, he said. I bought the van for £, about  years ago and set myself up here on this corner even before the Asda was built and I have worked hard to make myself an established business in that time.  Weaposre busy every day with a lot of local tradesmen and service people but we also get a large amount of people coming for a bite to eat after theyaposve been to the shops as well. Itaposs been amazing and we have some brilliant customers so to think of losing that trade now is very worrying for me and my family. When it opens next month I will be only a few feet away from the drive-through though Iaposm surethey wanted to they could have situated it slightly dferently to account for me being here.  Luckily I own this small corner of land on a long-term lease so thereaposs no way they can make me move from my spot. At the moment I constantly have people coming over and asking what Iaposm going to do when it opens, because they see how it looks with me right next-door, but my answer has always remained the same. Iaposve worked hard to get to where I am and Iaposm not planning on moving any time soon.  The site in Blaina Road was formerly home to the Dunlop Semtex factory but has seen a number of regeneration projects over the past two decades. Carl admits he does feel threatened by the positioning of the new McDonaldaposs restaurant, mainly because the fast-food chain could have a severe impact on his business over time. The business owner, who sells a range of burgers and hot dogs, as well as daily specials such as pork rolls, hopes that after such a long stint in the Brynmawr area his customers will continue using his services.  Itaposs going to be a massive competition for us to have a giant food chain like this open up so close and of course I am feeling the pressure of going up against them because I really donapost know whataposs going to happen, he said. Whether or not it was built this way on purpose I really donapost know but either way nobody has ever spoken to me about the construction. Obviously you want to see new things being built but at the same time what they have done with this McDonaldaposs has been ridiculous and I really do feel threatened by it now.  I just hope people keep coming here so I can continue to make a living and doing what I love to do. At my age Iaposm too old to do anything  now so this is incredibly important to me and my family and could have a big impact on our lives. Iaposm just thankful that I do have so many loyal customers and the support Iaposve had from the people of the town and even around the borough has meant a lot. I guess weaposll just have to keep going and see what happens now but of course it is a worrying time. A McDonaldaposs spokesman said: “Our new restaurant in Brynmawr will bring signicant investment to the area and create at least  jobs for local people. We are proud of the positive role we play in the communities we serve and look forward to welcoming customers when we open in early spring.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON McDonalds CorporationSmall businessesMcDonalds\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Speaking to the Daily Star, Quinn described an alleged incident where Meghan felt she was not being treated with the same respect as Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, while she and husband Prince Harry lived at the Palace.Meghan and Harry were living in whataposs called Nottingham Cottage and itaposs probably the only bit that you genuinely really could say, is actually quite small,” Quinn said.  And so, I think that reminded Meghan that she was, as it were, second place or as the runner-up. So, when Harry and Will got together and sometimes Meghan and Kate as well because there was this tension occasionally, famously Meghan slightly lost her temper with a member of Kateaposs staff in front of Kate. And it was that incident, that I was told by someone who was actually there, who said it was really uncomfortable because Meghan just lost it with this person.  The reason she lost it with Kateaposs member of staff was that she, Meghan, didnapost feel that this person was giving her the sort of attention she deserved. It was almost asin that one encounter, it encapsulated for Meghan the problem that she had, that sheaposs a Princess and sheaposs number two. He added: She was very successful, coming into this alien environment where people behave towards you according to where you are in the status of who becomes King or Queen next, thataposs just alien to her. The way it was described to me was, there were raised voices and foot-stamping. It is further claimed that the incident left Kate feeling really upset.  Mr Quinn continued: Meghan asked this person, I know who it was, but I canapost say because it will give away my source, who works for Kate who was basically asked to do something by Meghan and said, aposIaposm really sorry I canapost do that because I work for Kateapos. And Meghan really felt she had been slightly put in her place becauseyou become a Princess, you kind of assume that staff when you ask them to do something, they are going to do it. He added: Shewas horried, she was really upset because sheaposs very fond of this particular member of staff and she thought that Meghan almost bowling out this person was just completely unacceptable. Sheaposs very sensitive about not being treated with the same respect that she feels Kate is, so can react badly and doesnapost take it lying down. The Duchess of Sussex has been contacted for comment.

Brittany Haughton is demanding that the  are removed and she has already turned them off, reports Stoke Live. The -year-old, who has autism, moved into the -bedroomed council house in December  after being on the waiting list for over two years.And now she is locked into a -year long contract with the Community Energy Schemewhich she wants to end. But Brittany either has to accept the solar  or go back onto the waiting list for a house without the modern roof.  The house in Blurton is a Stoke-on-Trent City Council property but the fuel bill issues have caused Brittany extreme anxiety.The mum-of-two told Stoke-on-Trent Live : “The  were not saving me any money. I was still paying through the roof for electricity. I don’t see the point of them being on.“It has been stressing me out. I’m a single mum - it’s just shocking. I am worried in case debt collectors come knocking on my door. “I’ve got autism so I have problems in social situations. I struggle to read body language as well. I don’t like going out at all and I don’t like strangers in my home. I don’t need this. My anxiety is through the roof.” Brittany added: “If I hadn’t accepted this house I would have gone back on the waiting list. I first went on the list in  so I had already been waiting for two years.  “This was my ideal house and I needed it because one of my girls has special needs so she requires her own space so I had to accept the house, I couldn’t afford to wait any longer. “I want the solar  down - I’ve always wanted that. I’m very disappointed.” CES says any tenants who turn off the solar  are in breach of its contract.A CES spokesman said: “Throughout the coronavirus pandemic we were extremely conscious that many people were impacted financially.We were therefore very flexible in our approach to customer payments, and set up a bespoke Stoke-based team who recently started conversations with those customers who were not paying their bills to see how we could support them in doing so. “Options available to customers who engage with our team and provide an accurate meter reading could, for example, include -month payment plans or an export to the traditional energy grid for new energy use.  “Given our supply and charges are not impacted by wholesale supply or costs, we reduced our base price for solar usage by five per cent from October . “In practical terms that’s an average saving of  per cent against Ofgem’s current price cap. “Ofgem has now indicated that it will increase the price cap by over  per cent in April. Taking anticipated inflation into account, we expect that in April our prices will be in the region of  per cent cheaper than the price cap. “We’ve worked hard to find a way to get sustainable and affordable energy to those who would otherwise completely miss out. “We know ours is currently the only way to achieve this – there is no alternative scheme with the same offering – and we are determined to make it as easy and beneficial as possible to our customers. “We continue to welcome all tenants to get in touchthey have any questions or concerns so that we can take appropriate action to support them.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Solar powerproperty newsHousing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge aposs eldest children Prince George, eight, and Princess Charlotte, six, currently attend Thomasaposs Battersea School in London. But a rumoured move for the family from Amner House in Norfolk to Windsor Castle has raised questions about their future scholastic destinations, Gloucestershire Live reported.Some believe the Duchess of Cambridge already has her eye on her old school - Marlborough College - where the childrenaposs cousin Savannah is thought to be heading.Equally, a move to Windsor - where Eton College is situated - could be on the cards for George and Louis,they are to follow in the footsteps of Prince William and his younger brother Harry. Sources close to the couple have previously claimed that William was determined to break tradition. He is said to want George to remain a day pupil at Thomasaposs Battersea in London which is seen as a family-run, feeder school for the top public schools. The option may prove particularly tempting as the school is opening a senior wing in September, meaning George could stay there until he is .Others have put money on Marlborough College as a future destination for the kids. The elite private school is just over the border from Windsor in Wiltshire and is only an houraposs drive up the M from Windsor. Both Eton and Marlborough in Wiltshire are full boarding schools that take in pupils at the age of , but Marlborough has one big advantage over Eton. Marlborough is mixed-sex, so Princess Charlotte would be able to join him when she is old enough. This may be preferable to Eton, which only takes boys.  US Weekly reported that the Duke and Duchess had “open conversations” with George about whether to send him to boarding school, so the young prince may also have his say. A friend told the Daily Mail in : “Eton hasn’t been ruled out but they have talked atabout Marlborough as an option and the smart money is on George going there instead. “William and Catherine surprised many with their choice of Thomas’s Battersea for George over more traditional royal schools but picked it because they felt it was the right fit for him. They are very keen to allow George to spread his wings as a child and won’t ever do what people expect them to do when it comes to their children.” Fees are unlikely to be a deciding factor, even though Eton charges £, per year compared to Marlboroughaposs £, per annum for boarders.Eton can boast  prime ministers such as David Cameron and Boris Johnson among its rank.Other royals such as the Duke of Kent, and actors including Eddie Redmayne and Tom Hiddleston, also attended the school. Former Marlborough pupils include Princess Eugenie, comedian Jack Whitehall and Samantha Cameron - the we of former Prime Minister David. The decision will likely be an important one for Kate, who allegedly moved to Marlborough from Downe House because she was being bullied. She is said to have blossomed at Marlborough and left in July  to attend the University of St Andrews. Royal expert Duncan Larcombe told OK!: They [Kate and William] may well plump for Eton, the school where kings and prime ministers go. I wouldn’t be surprisedthey plumped for Kate’s school, Marlborough. It’s a mixed school and a very good one, so they might want to make a statement and send the children there.

Taking the statement as a pointed reference to Camilla, Mr Kay added: He might just as well have added aposand nor could anyone apos. The royal expert warned that a lack of warmth on the part of Harry towards his step-mother could be interpreted as a snub.

Mr Kay said it is now hard to relate Harryaposs praise for Camilla with his failure to acknowledge Camillaaposs new future title.In her announcement, the Queen said: “When, in the fullness of time, my son Charles becomes King, I know you will give him and his we Camilla the same support that you have given me. “And it is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service.” A spokesman for Charles said: “The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are touched and honoured by Her Majesty’s words.”Former BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said of the Queen’s announcement: “This is the most extraordinary message.”And recalling Diana’s Panorama interview in , Mr Hunt added: “For Camilla, the journey from being the third person in a marriage to queen-in-waiting, is complete.” Dickie Arbiter, a former press secretary to the Queen, said hostility towards Camilla after the  death of Diana “has evaporated completely”. He added: “The Duchess has shown that she is a great support to Charles, the Queen and the institution.” Royal author Dr Andrew Lownie said: “Camilla has earned her spurs.

Amy Marenghi says her six-month-old puppy, Phoebe, was left dazed and traumatised after she was given the wrong drug following a syringe mix-up.Phoebe had been taken to VetsPets at Glasgow Forge to be spayed on Wednesday morning when the mix-up occurred, Daily Record reports.When I first saw Phoebe I was in such a state of shock that I just left the vets with my mum, Amy said. Then it hit me that my dog could have died. I was raging. They caused unnecessary trauma. This is not okay, this could have resulted in a very dferent outcome. Our pets are supposed to be in their safe hands. I donapost want this to happen to any other pet.  Within hours of dropping Phoebe off, Amy received a phone call from the practice explaining that her pet had reacted to a drug and they couldnapost go ahead with the surgery. Amy was told to come to the vet practice to pick up her puppy just after lunchtime. When I got there she seemed absolutely dazed and I pressed to find out what had happened, Amy continued. The nurse then told me that she had accidentally been administered too much of the sedative but it was reversed as soon as they realised. I just wanted to get Phoebe home and I could tell that she just wasnapost herself, her eyes were really heavy and she was just cuddling into me because she was so traumatised. Amy was later told that Phoebe was given two drugs - one she took a reaction to and the other was too high a dose.  The retail worker said: I had not been told the truth. I believe thatthat nurse hadnapost told me what had actually happened I would be none the wiser. When I asked how did this happen, they just said the nurse had picked up the wrong syringe. I askedthings werenapost dual controlled but they couldnapost really give me an answer. She added: I said to the vet, Phoebe could have died, but his reply was just aposbut she didnapostapos. He was rude, and I felt he came across like he didnapost care. Thankfully Phoebe started to perk up on Thursday but this incident was careless. Iaposm taking a complaint to an independent authority. Amy requested Phoebeaposs medical notes but says there was nothing in the report to say there had been a mix-up with the syringes. A VetsPets spokesperson said: “Pet welfare is always our number one priority and we immediately informed Ms Marenghi of the error that occurred in administering Phoebe with her pre-procedure medication. The mistake was quickly addressed and Phoebe received continuous monitoring throughout the day. We are pleased that Phoebe has recovered and are very sorry for any upset and distress this situation has caused. We would also like to offer reassurances that whilst we already have robust processes in place to guard against such incidents, we will conduct a full process review and implement any appropriate findings.

They were delivered more than week before a foetus is deemed medically viable. And their gentle sobs were music to the ears of Jade and husband Steve, who had spent  years and £, trying to become parents. Speaking exclusively to the Sunday Mirror, Jade, , says: “When Harley let out the smallest of cries the room went mad and they suddenly offered le-saving treatment. “It was the same with Harry, who was inside me still for a full hour unmonitored. The babies had been given a zero percent chance of survival. “It felt amazing to hear them cry, though I was still scared.” But the tough siblings weren’t going anywhere and have gone from strength to strength – amazing doctors at the Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham.  Early pictures show just how tiny the babies were – their arms barely the size of their dad’s finger. “At birth they were smaller than an elf on the shelf,” Jade explains. “There wasn’t a nappy small enough. The smallest clothes are for babies up to .kg – well mine were g.” At birth their handspan was cm. It is now cm and they have doubled into cm. NHS worker Jade beams: “I’m so proud of my babies – they’re little fighters. For them to get through everything and still be there just smiling away is incredible. If they can do that, they can do anything.”Now  weeks, Harry and sister Harley could be discharged by their due date on February . In their quest to be parents, Jade and Steve, , endured  years of treatments – including eight cycles of IVF and several implantations of frozen embryos.They tried to conceive naturally for three years and Jade suffered an ectopic pregnancy before they began IVF in . The couple took out loans and worked hard to pay for £,-worth of treatment – which “nearly bankrupted us”.By late , Jade had another three miscarriages after IVF and was told she had an overactive immune system causing her body to reject pregnancy. But Jade and Steve, who works in sales, refused to give up hope. “We just wanted a family so bad and I’d had embryos frozen so we had a need to use them,” Jade says. The couple, who live in Derbyshire, made contact with another fertility clinic – in London’s Harley Street and reputededly one of the best in the world. Jade was prescribed medication to combat immune system problems.  Then, last May – IVF cycle number eight – the couple had two embryos transferred. Both worked and they were told they were expecting boy and girl twins. “I couldn’t let myself believe it,” Jade recalls. “I was so fearful of a miscarriage or something going wrong. I literally didn’t do anything during the pregnancy as a result. “The few bits of clothes that I did buy made me think that I better keep the tags on just in case – you just don’t want to let yourself believe.” On October  Jade went to get checked out after leaking fluid. An examination revealed she was experiencing membrane ruptures that happen before the onset of labour. Doctors are not required to medically intervene with babies born prior to  weeks as they are not considered to be viable. But Jade had chosen Queen’s as it has a more extensive neonatal intensive care unit than her local centre.  And, as a teaching hospital, staff intervene with babies born from  weeks to learn about premature births. At the time of going into labour, Jade was  hours away from the -week mark and was told she was likely to lose her precious twins. “It was so scary,” she shudders. “The doctor kept saying it was a miscarriage but I said it couldn’t be because I could feel the babies moving. I knew they were OK but was being told they wouldn’t survive at this stage of gestation. Labour happened really quickly. I was denied pain medication and monitoring during labour as I wasn’t viable, which was awful.” Doctors chose to intervene after her babies showed signs of le when born. Jade adds: “I remember saying that I couldn’t hear Harley cry and one of the nurses said I wouldn’t because she was far too early. “But then I heard this cry, like a tiny kitten. Harry did the same when he was born an hour later, still in his sac. In Japan, it is seen as being luckyyou have a baby born in their sac, so I held on to that luck!” Harley and Harry were incubated and whisked to the NICU – Neonatal Intensive Care Unit– where they remained on ventilators as doctors worked hard to save them. Two hours later, Jade was wheeled to the unit to meet her miracle twins. “I was in disbelief,” she says. “It was amazing. But seeing them so tiny and fragile in the NICU was scary with the doctor’s predictions in my head.” Desperate for hope, Jade and Steve searched out a mother of American twins born at  weeks, who are now four. They spoke via Instagram and Jade says: “She guided me through the first few days of being in the unit and what to ask for.”But things took a bleak turn at a week old when the twins were diagnosed with gastrointestinal illness necrotising enterocolitis. It can be fatal and the parents were told to prepare to say goodbye. It was a hellish time. Jade says: “We were told to get the family in and have a christening. “I kept referring to the christening as ‘the funeral’. It was just awful.” But the little fighters pulled through. Previously, the UK’s most premature twins to survive were Brighton tots Jenson and Reuben Powell, born at  weeks and six days, in . Jade got to hold her twins for the first time when they were four weeks.“It felt amazing to finally feel them moving again,” she smiles. The twins have had more health problems as a result of their premature birth, including chronic lung disease and sepsis, and have undergone six surgeries between them. But the siblings – who now weigh .kg, or .lbs – have defied the odds and are thriving in the NICU, where they have now spent  days. Jade goes on: “We are working towards the twins coming home on my due date. Usually doctors would tell us what they did with other babies at the same age, but they don’t have any  weekers to base it on because it just doesn’t happen. I’m really lucky that I went to Queen’s instead of my local hospital. If I’d gone there, I wouldn’t have come home with any babies, and it’s where the ambulance would have taken me because of the catchment – it’s a postcode lottery.” Matron Cheryl Grfiths and consultant Chantelle Tomlinson told the Mirror: “We are delighted to have been able to provide neonatal intensive care for Harley and Harry and to support them and their parents, Jade and Steve, in their journey.” Once discharged, the twins are likely to require oxygen at home and may suffer long-term issues. But Jade adds: “They’ll go down in medical history. I’m sure they’ll have a ward named after them because everyone is just amazed by them!” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSHarry CraneBabiesHospitalsPregnancyGiving birthImmune systemMiscarriageTwinsIVFFertility\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ophelia is obsessed with her little brother already.” She also told Radford fans that Friday was her due date.Sibling Chloe, who is also pregnant, said that she is looking to meet the new member of the family.She wrote: “We cannot wait to meet him. O is gonna be the best big sister.”  Many others replied on Instagram wishing Millie “congratulations”. One said: “Congrats Millie, Ophelia will be a great big sister.” Parents Sue and Noel are parents to Chris, , Sophie, , Chloe, , Jack, , Daniel, , Luke, , Millie, , Katie, , James, , Ellie, , Aimee, , Josh, , Max, , Tillie, , Oscar, , Casper, nine, Hallie, six, Phoebe, five, Archie, four, Bonnie, three, and Heidie, one.

The gathering in Morecambe Parish church was the first time four generations of the Radford family had gathered in one place in over two years, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Daily Star reports.Perhaps unsurprisingly, the vicar Catherine Hayden was daunted but excited by the prospect of managing such an enormous brood.  “This is my first Radford baptism,” Catherine admitted. “I love doing baptisms, and I love having a church full of children, so it is a very exciting thing to be doing.” “I don’t think I’ve ever seen that many people from one immediate family in a church, it’s great to have them here though.” Despite the stresses of the day’s preparations, Bonnie and Heidi’s ceremony went largely unhitched. There were a few tears from Bonnie when the vicar dripped holy water onto her head, while Heidi pulled a rather bemused expression. “It was nice, a nice little service, Bonnie wasn’t overly pleased with the holy water side of it, but yeah, she’s alright now,” Noel reflected. “It’s been a really stressful week, but the kids have come through,” Sue added.

She has a rare type of cancer called Neuroendocrine which started in her pancreas and has spread during the years she was misdiagnosed. For nearly three years, Laura was repeatedly turned away from doctors when she complained about pain in her stomach and back. To make matters worse, at the time, Laura and her husband, Paul Anderson, were trying for a child. Laura said: “I was in and out of the GP with lots of lower abdominal pain and lower back pain. “When I had blood taken they would just say it was a viral infection, continuously, just say viral infection until I persisted and pushed. Have you got a similar story to tell  Email webnews@mirror  “I was always missing work and we were trying to conceive after we got married in . “You’re explaining that to the GP and I just thought there was something wrong with me, something related to oies or something like that. But they never investigated more early on.” Laura was repeatedly dismissed by her GP and told she just had an infection and she woud be fine. On one occasion when her pain was investigated, they found a swollen spleen but she was dismissed and told it would go down with time. Then, to make matters worse, the pandemic hit, and Laura’s le, like that of so many others, was thrown into turmoil. As GP surgeries shted to virtual or phone call triages and appointments, Laura often found herself in agony without medical support.  She said: “I was in and out of AE during Covid, getting ultrasounds and loads of other scans. “In January  when I was at my worst healthwise, the pain was so severe, I got a scan, and on it, it showed I had a swollen spleen. “They said to me there and then, you’re young, you’re fit, you’re healthy and it’ll go down in time. “I went back in April, the easiest thing was to go back to AE otherwise I was not being seen.” Laura constantly battled back and forth to be seen and taken seriously. In May she had three separate scans to try and figure out why she was in pain. Doctors eventually thought she had endometriosis after looking into her oies and referred her to a fertility clinic. Laura said: “I didn’t give up, I had to go back into AE for a third time [in June] and had an ultrasound and met a radiologist and they saw a shadow on the scan and put me in for an MRI. “That’s when then they called me into the GP and told me ‘you have a tumour in your pancreas, it looks like pancreatic cancer, you have three months to live’ and at this time I hadn’t seen any of my family in a while, and they were like ‘You need to go home to your family’.” After her diagnosis, Laura was put on chemotherapy but said that it didn’t work for her and instead of bringing the tumour down, her cancer spread to her lymph nodes. With the help of her husband, they began looking for other treatments for her ‘incurable’ cancer. After speaking to a neuroendocrine specialist from Manchester, she came across a clinic in Mexico that offered alternative treatments. Laura chose to pursue the treatments not offered on the NHS, including “non-toxic” medicine and focusing on the “mental and emotional roots” of the cancer.However, the clinic costs in excess of £, for an approximately three-week course, so Laura was forced to turn to fundraising to get there. Family, friends and loved ones from Ireland rallied round and in only a few days she raised the money she initially needed. However, when she was out there she was told by the clinic she’d need more treatment which would cost even more, forcing her to turn to fundraising once more.

The specialist in Glasgow said something’s working but we don’t know what, they’re sceptical about the help the clinic offers. “Every penny means so much for us, and it’s hope for the future.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSBack painTherapyCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Angela, from Hampshire, admitted she never had a great relationship with food,” as she shared her weight loss transformation. She explained: “After the birth of my second child I fell very ill with leukaemia. My marriage broke down, I lost my hearing due to the cancer treatment, and I wasn’t able to do my job anymore.I was feeling low, and the weight crept on, my blood pressure was high, and I had a number of health issues. When I moved area with my children and new partner Phil, I made the decision to lose weight and start taking care of myself.“I tried to lose weight in the first lockdown, but I couldn’t do it on my own and I knew I needed the support of a group. This is when Angela decided to join Slimming World.She explained: “I was slightly nervous going to my first group and couldn’t believe it when I stood on the scales to find I was  stone . pounds. I cried when I realised my BMI was in the obese category. “Emma and the other members were so kind and welcoming, though, and they put me right at ease. From the moment I arrived, I felt no judgement, only acceptance. Going to group has been a lesaver for me, it has helped me to set goals, understand where I might trip up on my weight-loss journey, and put plans in place to make sure I continue to lose weight.Angela admitted that before starting her weight loss journey, she didn’t really pay attention to what she was eating. But now I really enjoy trying new Slimming World recipes, and I never feel hungry. I’ve been able to adapt Slimming World’s Food Optimising plan to create meals my family enjoy, and make healthy swaps, like using leaner meat and less oil. “For a long time I’ve been unable to even walk to the end of my road without getting out of breath, but with the support from my Slimming World group, I started introducing exercise slowly, and now I enjoy going swimming three to four times a week, and when I can’t go you’ll find me going for a long walk.  She continued: “I’m still on my weight-loss journey, but I’m so proud of how far I’ve come. I always wore leggings before with large, baggy tops as nothing  fitted me, now I’ve lost weight I enjoy trying on clothes and really think about what I want to wear. Slimming World has given me the confidence in myself to continue making healthy changes and choices, and the energy to do all the things I want to.” Emma Jones, from Slimming World group, said: “Angela has fully embraced Slimming World’s Food Optimising and physical activity Body Magic programmes and is doing incredibly well.

The “captivating” doctor enjoyed such a close relationship with the Prince she was a guest at his th birthday party at Windsor Castle in , with Epstein and his “madam” Ghislaine Maxwell. But when asked by the Mirrorshe would be supporting Andrew, , in his lawsuit, she smiled behind her mask but declined to comment.Askedshe would give evidence on his behalf or give details about his friendship with Epstein, again she refused to talk. A former worker at Epstein’s Zorro ranch told the pair’s closeness. He said: “Melanie was incredibly charming, lovely and captivating, one of the most intelligent figures I ever met in Jeffrey’s world. “After she was introduced to Andrew, they just seemed to click. She knew him better than anyone in that circle. “They spent a lot of time together, inseparable even. I never saw them ­intimate, but other staff told me they had grown very, very close. She could not be more opposite to Virginia. Although they were both integral to Jeffrey, I never saw them meet. “Unless something went wrong between them [the Duke and Dr Walker], I suspect she would be very supportive of Andrew. “I would think her evidence could only be to his advantage. She knows more than most about how close Epstein and Andrew were and the time they spent together.” It is not knownDr Walker, who the Duke jokingly called “smartypants” and “dork”, has been approached by his legal team to give a statement. The Mirror understands Ms Giuffre’s lawyers have no intention of subpoenaing the medic. There is no suggestion Dr Walker knew or was present when Epstein and Maxwell are accused of abusing girls or knew anything about the allegations surrounding Andrew.  Former Zorro housekeeper Deidre Stratton claimed Andrew was “given” Dr Walker to keep him company for three days when he stayed at the ranch in  or  when Epstein was not there. She said the Duke, then  or , was put up in a self-contained three-bedroom guest property on the estate. She added: “At the time, Jeffrey had this, she supposedly was a neurosurgeon, quite young, ­beautul, brilliant, and she stayed in the home with him.” Deirdre said she saw no sexual activity between Andrew and Dr Walker, then . A former personal protection officer of the Prince said the pari were alone for most of their stay at Zorro, having only occasional contact with staff.Referring to his notes taken at the time, the bodyguard said Epstein and Maxwell joined them for “at least one night”, but they were the only visitors. The officer was adamant it was the only time the Duke ever visited Zorro. This contradicts court-made claims by Epstein’s former teen “sex slave” Ms Giuffre that she was once flown there alone to spend time with Andrew – an allegation the royal unequivocally denies. The bodyguard said he is sure the Prince never met or saw Ms Giuffre during his time with the Duke. Dr Walker was at the Dance of the Decades party which the Queen threw for milestones, including Andrew’s th birthday. Also there were Epstein, who died in jail aged  in  awaiting trial on child sex-trafficking charges and Maxwell, , who in December was convicted of procuring, grooming and trafficking young girls.  Dr Walker, a professor of neurological surgery at the University of ­Washington School of Medicine, has previously praised the Duke. In a  interview, she said they were friends who talked “mostly about science and medicine” and kept in touch via email. She met Epstein in  while visiting New York after graduating from the University of Texas. He approached her while she was having tea at the Plaza Hotel and told her he could get her an audition to model for Victoria’s Secret as he knew owner Lex Wexner. She decided to finish medical school instead. From  to  records show her listed at a Manhattan address owned by Epstein where she would stay when visiting New York.  She became his science adviser in  and a year later began to appear as a passenger on flight logs for his “Lolita Express” jet. She later met Steven Sinofsky, , a senior executive at Microsoft and moved to Seattle to be with him. They live in a £.million flat overlooking Elliott Bay. In  she joined the Gates Foundation. She reportedly introduced Epstein to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. Ms Giuffre, , is suing for unspecied damages that US lawyers have said could top £million. The American mum-of-three claims that in  when she was  – underage in US law – she was trafficked to London by Maxwell and Epstein to have sex with Andrew. Ms Giuffre also alleges she was forced to have sex with the Prince at Epstein’s home in New York and the US Virgin Islands. Andrew emphatically denies her allegations. Last month he demanded a trial by jury in a bid to clear his name after failing to have her US civil lawsuit thrown out by a New York judge. The case is in the discovery phase, during which both sets of lawyers will grill witnesses under oath, including Andrew, his family and friends.

And there are a few very common nightmare topics that many experience time and time again - these may include teeth falling out, falling, dying and a partner cheating.But have you ever wondered what they really mean  If youaposve had any of these bad dreams and want to know whataposs going on, then youaposre in luck as a dream specialist has explained the truth behind the nightmares. Delphi Ellis has explained the meaning behind common nightmares - and what you can do about them.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here. Speaking to The Mirror, Delphi discussed what your teeth dreams mean.She said: This is a really common dream, the interpretation of which is steeped in traditional meaning. For some cultures the teeth represent people, so to dream of losing a tooth may symbolise a fear of losing someone close to you. Today, teeth can also represent status and wealth - so, again, to dream of onefalling out can suggest that money is an issue. The specialist went on to say: Lots of people dream that the teeth are crumbling into the mouth.  Anything in the mouth in a dream can symbolise a problem with communication, so have a think about with whom youaposre struggling to get your point across. Delphi also explained what dreams about death really mean - but it turns out there isnapost one simple explanation. We know, from years of research, that all dreams mean something. Everybody is dferent, so dreams of death will mean something unique to the dreamer, she shared. In some traditions, people come together and discuss their dreams each morning - dreaming of death was a good sign, with the prospect that this was news predicting a birth. Death in dreams can also reflect change we see in others or ourselves. If someone we love is behaving dferently, this can manest as a death in a dream.  She continued: Young mums often dream about the death of their babies, recognising the responsibility they feel for the safety of their child and the worry that something bad may happen. Parents may also have death dreams as children grow older, acknowledging that the vulnerable young person who depended on them is no longer there. Some people fear dreams of death are an omen that something bad is about to happen Iaposve met many people who have described predictive dreams, so itaposs understandable why some people worry it will come true when they dream that someone passes away. Thankfully though, dreams of death - whilst disturbing - mainly serve to remind us how precious le is and that we should make the most of every moment with the people we love and care about. Death dreams can be caused by anxiety, particularlywe have heard news of a passing or there is someone precious on our mind as we start to consider our own mortality we may be thinking about how time could be running out. Itaposs important to address anxiety and set yourself up for a good night sleep, by dealing with stress positively during the day and ensuring your bedroom environment is relaxing and calm. Delphi also told how there are two types of dream about falling - one where the dreamer aposrelishesapos the feeling of falling and the other where it is not enjoyable.

For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. In the clip, Owen revealed his purchase and said: I waited ages and paid £ for these and I’ve texted and complained, they said they are going to sort it.” During the review, which has been viewed more than . million times, Owen first showed off his own teeth before putting in the bottom row of the pearly white set. He said: Bottom ones are actually sweet, nothing wrong with them.  However, it quickly goes downhill for Owen as he clips in the top set of teeth which pushes out his top lip and leaves him struggling to speak. Mortied at the result, he questioned: Are you going to tell me that these are normal  They are huge, I’ve got a f***ing overbite. In good humour, Owen gave a dashing smile that left the lad’s fluorescent white teeth touching below his bottom lip. Tickled by Owen’s set of ‘huge’ teeth, many people took to the comments to poke fun at the veneers. One person chuckled: Whose horse is that  Another user added: You could enter the Grand National with them… And someone  giggled: Mouthful of headstones. Meanwhile, a fourth user remarked: I made the mistake of buying them too. Even my horse has smaller teeth than the overpriced tatt. Never got my refund.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Some people praised the unnamed mum for taking the time to make such a lovely, artistic lunch, with one saying: aposI would seriously wet my pantsI got a butterfly sandwich for school! I love the effort you put into everything.aposapos A second posted: Youaposre a fantastic mamma. A butterfly sandwich. Wow. But despite how impressive the lunch looked, a few still managed to find something to criticise the mum for. Others couldnapost help but point out that it might have been a aposwaste of timeapos making the food look so nice as it would get tossed about in a school bag, while a few thought the mum had made a mistake by packing it in the wrong kind of tub. One person said: Thataposs so gorgeous! Itaposs a shame it wonapost look the same when they open it....it all gets messed up once in the bag. Another wrote: Wonapost the sandwich go very dry by tomorrow  aposapos A third replied: Shouldnapost it be in an airtight container.aposapos This comes after a snap of a dferent lunchbox went viral, as people tried to work out what was wrong with it. The seemingly innocent-looking lunchbox should apparently be ringing alarm bells for parents. The tin contained ham white bread sandwiches, crackers, a fruit roll-up and a chocolate yoghurt and looks pretty similar to what many of us tucked into at break time when we were kids.But according to Australian nutrition experts at the Cancer Council NSW, this meal could actually be doing more harm than good saying it hides an uncomfortable truth parents might not want to face. To highlight their concerns, they also shared a photo of a second lunchbox to seepeople can notice the dference.The second lunch box contains a cheese and tomato sandwich, fruit, vegetable sticks and yoghurt. The images were intended to show parents how much sugar is hidden in their childaposs lunches, as the first box contains twice the sugar and half the second packed lunch.You canabout it here.What do you think of the lunch  Let us know in the comments below.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ParentingViralFood\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Serve the food you really want to eat by signing up for our tips and recipes and never be bored by your cooking againSign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Holidaymakers who witnessed the incident have told of how they thought they were going to die during the bizarre ruckus, which reportedly saw the mum and daughter lunge for the drive while on a bus trip during their TUI holiday to the Caribbean. The duo, who hailed from Essex, were said to have been smoking weed and eating rum cake prior to boarding the bus back to their hotel, in Montego Bay.Witnesses told the Sun Online that the pair became agitated to the point that they began to scream about being “kidnapped”.Adding fuel to the flames, the mum and daughter posted on social media during the meltdown, ly alleging they were being “sex trafficked”.The posts caught the attention of their followers and spread like wildfire on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.The daughter has since cleared up the “misunderstanding” with a post on Instagram stating the family is safe.  The episode was reportedly triggered by weed, which prompted the pair to become frantic and paranoid as the busload of British tourists were being ferried past Dunns Falls and Bob Marleyaposs house on the sun-soaked island. They attempted to grapple with the driver and pull the handbrake of the coach before leaping from the moving vehicle. The bus driver was later hailed as a “hero” by the family’s fellow tourists for keeping his cool during the -minute trip and getting most passengers to their destinations. The mum allegedly started to claim there was a plot to “kidnap” her and her daughter after the pair allegedly smoked a joint at the Bob Marley Museum at Nine Mile, the tour’s final stop. Chaos ensued, as the bus tried to navigate the winding trip back to Montenegro bay while the pair became increasingly erratic, and eventually convinced themselves other tourists on the bus were involved in the “plot”. One passenger, Darrell Smith told the Sun Online that he had turned to his we Jemma to say “I love you”, as he thought it might be “the last time [he] got to say it”. Darrell and Jemma had had a “fantastic day” with the tour group as they explored the countryside, Darrell said, but things had changed dramatically when they got back to the bus after visiting Nine Mile. The women became increasingly delusional and tried to force open the bus doors as it was still moving, he said, travelling at speeds of up to mph. Other passengers were forced to restrain the mum as she started screaming “stop the bus”, he said, while he grabbed the daughter as she jumped over the front seats and pulled up the handbrake. At one point, the mum opened the bus window and tried to leap out, but she instead bumped her head, causing a bloody gash to appear on her eye. Darrell suggested the weed had “triggered something”, while his we Jemma said she thought she was “going to die”. Jemma was now concerned about the story of kidnap still being out there on the internet - despite the fact, none of it had happened. The step mum and her daughter had reportedly been travelling with other members of their family, who were said to have tried to calm them down. Another passenger said it was “wrong that info like this gives Jamaica and their hotel a bad name when they did nothing but try to keep them safe. Another Brit tourist, who was staying at the same hotel as the family, said: They had some weed and rum cake and lost the plot. The family have since ed to the UK, as travel company TUI is reportedly investigating the incident. A spokesman said: We take reports of this nature seriously and have been in continued contact with the family and will continue to offer our full support.

Raju became a global symbol of hope among animal welfare campaigners and his rescue has led to  other elephants being saved from similar horric abuse. Shackled  hours a day in spiked chains, he had been ­routinely beaten and starved. But he was saved in a daring midnight rescue by a team from British and Indian ­charity Wildle SOS, who were “stunned” when Raju wept as he realised his ordeal was ending.Photos of him crying as his chains were cut away were revealed in the Sunday People before making ­headlines around the globe.Wildle SOS co-founder Kartick Satyanarayan said much has changed in the years since. He said: “He’s ­finally learned to trust humans again – that really is a miracle. He’d gone through so much suffering we’d wonderedthat could ever be possible.  “Once he realised he was in safe hands, Raju gradually began to show us his personality and has become extremely gentle. His rehabilitation has been astonishing to witness.” Today, Raju has a field to walk freely around, takes relaxing dust baths and even has a personal pool to splash about in, playing with his favourite toy – a huge rubber tyre. But, says Kartick, the story does not end there. He stressed: “If anything, it begins from it. Our team now works with unparalleled dedication in ­tracking ailing, abused elephants from all across the country.”  Support from around the globe after Raju’s rescue has enabled the charity to save  more elephants – with the most recent rescue on New Year’s Eve. Kartick said: “Our latest three, all saved in December, sum up the suffering.Pari, who arrived at our elephant hospital on December , has been left crippled where she’d been tethered in an abnormal position for decades.  “Ginger was covered in chemical paint and charcoal decorations – used for wedding processions, but also to distract from her terrible abscesses and bull hook wounds.” On top of that, Ginger is blind, probably done to her deliberately to make money out of people’s sympathy.Kartick added: “It’s heartbreaking. She’s suffered  years of horror. She must be so exhausted.” The third and most recent rescued animal is Lakshmi, between  and  years old and thought to be the thinnest elephant ever seen in India.  Kartick said: “It’s shocking to see a severely crippled and emaciated elephant like Lakshmi – she’s one of the worst cases we’ve ever witnessed.” The extensive work is made possible by donations since Raju’s plight touched the world.Kartick said: “His legacy is leading to the rescue of many more in desperate need, who will live out their days in peace and freedom at our sanctuaries.” When Raju – thought to be  – was rescued in July , he had been “owned” by  dferent people across five decades. Kartick said: “It had left him gaunt and miserable. He was restrained with spiked chains and his withering body bore multiple scars and chronic ­abscesses – it was pitul.”  The charity boss, who founded Wildle SOS in  with Geeta Seshamani, says he will never forget the moment his team cut Raju free. He said: “Re­moving those chains was symbolic. As well as freeing Raju, for us it meant this great responsibility to give him a second chance at le. “And as for the tears  It was so incredibly emotional for all of us. We don’t know how scientic this is, but it seemed like he understood that we were there to help him.”  ­Kar­tick says there are “many, many more” elephants still needing rescue, used for circuses, street begging, weddings and tourist rides.He fears many people still do not realise the brutality used to make them compliant.  They are deprived of sleep, food and water for months, tightly restrained, and beaten into submission with electric prods and bullhooks. Kartick said: “The process is brutal. It is known as ‘phajaan’, or the breaking of the spirit. The objective is to drive fear into it to the extent that it’s too terried to ever retaliate.”  While many UK tour operators now promote cruelty-free travel, he says everyone can help by signing the petition at refusetoride.org. Kartick added: “For every elephant ride that makes one feel like royalty, we must remember that the elephant suffers a letime of abuse and torture.  “With the help of the Refuse to Ride campaign, we encourage tourists to opt for ethical practices by refusing to ride them for entertainment. “Our message is simple –you love elephants, please do not ride them.” To support the charity or donate, visit wildlesos.orgMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CharitiesElephantsSunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She claims she went on a date with the aposPrince of Diamondsapos back in . Speaking to The Mirror, she says she spotted a number of concerning red flags early doors - and made a quick escape. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Originally from Argentina, Valeria has lived in Germany since . She initially made the move for a work and travel experience before deciding to stay long-term. Valeria currently resides in the capital city of Berlin, however, for her first year in Germany she lived in Munich. It was here where she says she met the notorious aposhomeless kingapos.Speaking with The Mirror,Valeria recalled how she was still new to Munich and keen to meet people when she matched with Leviev on Tinder.She revealed: I had a Tinder account by then so I saw this guy called aposSimonapos, who seemed good looking and that he travelled a lot. I also love travelling, I have been to many countries, so I thought it would be nice to meet up. I was curious.According to Valeria, Leviev immediately asked for her WhatsApp number, and they mainly communicated through WhatsApp in the run-up to their date. Things moved fast from there.Valeria said: Our date was very spontaneous, and happened a day after we matched. I had just finished work and he texted sayingI was free to meet up. I think he sent a voice message. Although she didnapost have any serious suspicions at the time, she was expecting maybe he could be not who he said he was. She said: My first thought was aposmillionaires are not flashing their money on Tinder.. because they donapost need toapos. So I was curious to see what he was actually like.In keeping with his opulent tastes, she says suggested they meet outside a hotel on one of the most expensive streets in Munich, in an area filled with designer shops. They then walked to a restaurant to grab a coffee. It was at this point she started to develop a fuller impression of him. Valeria said: I remember we sat for five minutes and then he suggested we go to another place because he didnapost like the menu. Then I went to a fancy cigar store with him because he wanted to smoke one. After that we went into a mall, where we finally sat at a cafe, which seemed like an expensive place as well. She remembers Leviev as a talkative guy, but noted that he was more into talking about himself, remarking that it appeared he wanted to give the impression that he was mysterious. At one point, Valeria asked Leviev where he was from - but he refused to give her a straight answer. Other red flags started to emerge, including that he had two mobile phones and openly took a couple of bizarre calls while still on the date. She claims Leviev discussed million-dollar transactions on these calls, which she found. Who talks about money in front of a stranger , she asks. She added: It was also weird that he would talk about other girls, saying that they always sent him photos, he even showed me some. I wouldnapost trust someone who shows other girls private photos.  Their date lasted about an hour, and while she says there was nothing too concerning about their first meeting she couldnapost work him out. She said: I was still not surehe was genuine or not. But it wasnapost the last time she heard from the trickster, and claims he messaged her later that night inviting her a party at his Munich home. She said: It was already very late and I was in my pyjamas, so of course, I didnapost feel like going. We had a little conversation via WhatsApp but I really didnapost feel like going so he said something like aposI thought you were more spontaneous than thatapos.  Valeria first read DWaposs original article about aposThe Tinder Swindlerapos after somebody shared it on a Munich-related Facebook group. She instantly recognised the conman as the man sheaposd been on a date with, and was shocked by his behaviour.After finding out who Leviev really was beneath the flashy clothes and bravado, Valeria was naturally surprised, but then remembered that she knew there was something not so right about him. So everything made sense.She didnapost tune into the Netflix documentary immediately after its release, catching up with it for the very first time on Monday, February . She was already aware of the story and Levievaposs deceitful nature, but still couldnapost help but find it to be a shocking watch.Valeria said: I am shocked that many women would believe him, but my theory is that he had many tinder dates in a day and would carefully choose his victims because not everyone can fall for him. He was a professional. Leviev has released a statement following the Netflix show, which reads: “I will share my side of the story in the next few days, but I’ve sorted out the best and most respectful way to tell it both to the involved parties and myself. Until then, please keep an open mind and heart.”Have you got a shocking or interesting story to tell  We pay for stories.

New symptoms of the iant are often tricky to spot and donapost emerge immediately.Most people affected by the milder strain will suffer a cold-like symptoms such as runny nose and sore throat.But experts have highlighted a strange symptom all mums should be aware of.Nikki Jurcutz, a mum and CEO of the Australian parenting organisation Tiny Hearts Education, posted on Instagram that one motheraposs breast milk had turned green after she and and her baby contacted Covid.It may look a bit gross, but this incredible colour change is the antibodies in this mamaaposs milk doing their thing! And doing it right! she posted on the . When weaposre lactating, our bodies are consistently doing whataposs like a full-body scan of both our own and our bubaposs body to perfectly create breastmilk for our little loveaposs optimum health, as well as recovery from illness.  Itaposs pretty mind-blowing when you think about it! Motheraposs milk is often described as “liquid gold” as it can adjust nutrients to suit a baby’s needs. Ashmiry, a mum-of-two, posted two images of her breast milk in pouches before and after she caught the virus.One of the pouches was white as it is expected to be but, when she and her her daughter tested positive for Covid-, the second picture showed green-tinged milk after they became ill with the virus.She was astonished to see the colour of her milk change.But she was also excited because it showed her body was creating extra nutrients to keep her daughter nourished. She wrote: “I really wanted to share this photo of my breast milk. “It actually let me know something was going on in my body and my babies. “How amazing is breast milk, it’s magical and I’m so thankful to be able to produce it especially now!  “The colour change indicates that my body is making exactly what Rubi needs! Antibodies, extra fatty and just pure goodness.” She admitted that she drank the breast milk when ill with Covid-. She explained: “I was so grateful at that time, that I was still nursing. “Otherwisenot I would have not experienced that or seen what my body was able to do for Rubi. “We all had some of that breast milk. I had my own breast milk. “But hey I got better, I was tired of being sick, so I was thinking aposI’m going to drink some of that breast milkapos, and I did. I don’t knowit helped, who knows.While the green milk was a result of coronavirus - this isnapost always the case andyouaposre concerned, you should check with your midwe.Green milk can also be caused by the food and drink you consume. One breastfeeding support coach explained that you shouldnapost panicyour breast milk is green. Juobie said: Donapost panic, itaposs organic.Typically breast milk will turn greenish in colour when you have consumed green foods including vegetables, food that contains green dyes and certain vitamins or herbs. It is safe to give to baby, so donapost be too quick to pour down the drain. Golidilacts, a lactation consultant, also shared the image calling the milk, liquid green gold alongside the message, “our breasts are super responders”. “When lactating, our bodies are always doing full body scans of mama and baby and figuring out exactly what to put in breast milk for babies wellness,” he said.

Every pound raised will add up to help keep children safe.It is free for any school to sign up and once a school has registered, the NSPCC will send it everything it needs to make its Number Day a success.Schools will be sent tips and ideas on how to fundraise, including games and activities resources to help promote Number Day information on keeping children safe from harm and online safety quizzes that can be used with pupils of all ages. After the challenges of the past  months and the disruption that children have faced, we hope it will be a day of fun to look forward to.To sign up to take part in Number Day, all you need to do is visit the NSPCC’s website and search for Number Day and fill in your school’s details using the registration form.Head of Fundraising for NSPCC Scotland Paul CockramSirThere is a real emergency for colleges coming after years of underinvestment. Regarding the sector, the debate on funding should focus on the perilous choices some colleges will now have to make, and on the signicant challenge this Draft Budget poses for the next academic year.The total funding loss of £. million means, for example, freezing recruitment, outsourcing support activities, possible changes to temporary contracts, increasing class sizes and consolidating classes.All of these would be a last resort, however, after years of under investment this Budget leaves no more space to manoeuvre in. Unless there are improvements to the Budget, noticeable changes to colleges are inevitable.We believe this risks Scotland sliding into a skills emergency. Even in the midst of a pandemic colleges have provided world class education and training to hundreds of thousands of students.But in order to continue there has to be investment based in reality. Scotland’s recovery depends on creating year after year a workforce that is qualied and able – but with the proposed Budget settlement, colleges will be challenged in ways not seen for many years.Chair of Colleges Scotland Ken Milroy MBEThe Poverty and Inequality Commissionhas published advice to the Scottish Government on its Child Poverty Delivery Plan -SirOur advice shows that, quite simply, too many children are still experiencing poverty in Scotland. As a society we believe it’s wrong for children’s lives to be restricted by poverty. That’s why the child poverty targets were set.While we know work is ongoing, progress is not enough to meet the targets, and for some measures the position is worsening. Despite a clear commitment, the action taken by the Scottish Government so far is inadequate We need to see Holyrood using all the levers available to end the scourge of child poverty.We need to see action across all areas of Government in order to release families from the constraints of poverty. Providing parents with support to apply for a job, for example, won’t have the impact we wantthe parent can’t get suitable childcare or doesn’t have a reliable bus service to get them to work.Targets to reduce child poverty can be met, however the Scottish Government will have to utilise every opportunity and deliver action faster, coupled with a signicant increase in fundingWe are committed to working with the Scottish Government to eradicate child poverty and ensure it remains one of its top priorities. It will take a concerted joint effort from PIC, the Scottish Government and its partners to resolve these issues and ensure our children have the very best start in le.Chair of the Poverty and Inequality Commission Bill Scott "},{"url":null,"title":"help elaine conquer the world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMid Argyll#s very own racing star Elaine MacEachern is aiming for the top # but she needs help.Just four months after breaking her leg at the Women#s Motocross World Championships in Madrid, talented Elaine is hungry to test herself once more against the very best.After a three-year break from the sport, Ormsary girl Elaine stormed to the  British Women#s Motocross title.Moving on to the world championship Spanish round, there was disappointment as the rigours of practise left her with a broken tibia and fibula.Now fit again and excited for , Elaine is looking for new sponsors.She explained: #The support I receive is incredibly kind and a huge factor in me being able to achieve the British championship in .#This year my plans are to defend the women#s British title, to race as many women#s world championship rounds as possible and also in the MX class in the ScotMX championship alongside the men.#For the women#s British they have moved from three rounds to six.

But by the time I was on the case, the disease was spreading closer to home # in forests near Loch Carron, Ross and Cromarty.Phytophthora, ominously meaning #plant destroyer#, is a genus of fungus-like organisms containing around  known species with a worldwide distribution.The genus, which includes the pathogens that cause potato blight and sudden oak death, has been responsible for massive crop failures, economic loss and environmental damage.Phytophthora are called #fungus-like# since they behave like fungi but dfer from them, and from all animals and plants, in several key features of their reproduction and chemical makeup.This places them in an ill-defined group of misfits called protists, which also includes amoebae, kelp and slime moulds.Phytophthora pluvialis was discovered in Oregon USA in , where it resides in soil and watercourses, and mainly infects Douglas fir.Its recognition in Cornwall during  was the first identication of this particular Phytophthora species in Europe.Thought to have arrived here on imported live plants, its spores germinate in water and can be spread, for instance, on shoes, tyres and animal paws.The pathogen infects a iety of trees, including western hemlock, Douglas fir and several pine species, causing needle shedding, shoot dieback and lesions on the branches, trunks and roots of infected trees.Forestry and Land Scotland and its policy section Scottish Forestry took rapid action # surveillance to detect infected forests, restrictions on the movement of timber and trees, and asking the public to report suspicious tree lesions.But since the European climate is ideal for P pluvialis to thrive, and its favoured trees are commonly grown here, like so many other plant pathogens, it seems likely that this one is here to stay for the long term.Forestry and Land Scotland asks foresters and the public to be vigilant for signs of Phytophthora pluvialis.Anyone who thinks they might have spotted signs of the disease should report it using the online TreeAlert system on the on www.forestresearch.gov.uk website."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures february 4 2022","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

It’s very clear though, the rules of Wales apply when you’re in Wales.”The minister criticised the Prime Minister for “ambushing” the devolved governments and even his own Cabinet members with the decision about scrapping self-isolation rules, and suggested such moves were a barrier to a closer working relationship between the two governments.Responding to the claims, Mr Davies said: “The Welsh Government have been present at Cobra meetings where a lot of the decisions have been taken, so they know exactly how we’ve arrived at the decisions.“They have not allowed the UK Government equal access to meetings at which they take decisions. So we never have a clue what they’re about to do.“We should be working more closely together and it’s an absolute crying shame that we can’t, and that instead of working closely, they’re determined to take every opportunity to attack the UK Government and drive a wedge between the UK Government and Wales.”On the same day as PMQs, the House of Commons Welsh Affairs Committee heard evidence from experts about intergovernmental relations, including Philip Rycroft CB, former permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union, who said the Covid- pandemic had been a “huge missed opportunity”.Mr Rycroft, also the former head of the UK Governance Group at the Cabinet Office, said: “I think it all began to fracture in about May , when the Prime Minister was on the TV making announcements about changes to the rules and regulations without it being clear whether he was speaking about England or the whole of the UK.

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

concern by Musselburgh and District Angling Clubabout the issue of mine water discharge, fearing it was having “a negative effect on the fish and invertebrate communities in the South Esk”.These concerns predate the recent pollution incident in the River Esk last month.Residents who attended the Coal Authority sessions heard more details about the plans for the treatment scheme at Dalkeith, which will remove iron and manganese from water flowing from a historical drainage tunnel adjacent to Newmills Road, known locally as Junkies Adit.The tunnel is linked tothe extensive underground coal mine workings in the Midlothian area.In recent years, the amount of mine water discharging from Junkies Adit has been increasing and the water quality has been deteriorating, the Coal Authority said.The organisation explained that the water affected was visibly orange, which was a result of naturally occurring iron dissolving in the mine water underground, which then became solid as it mixed with air and settled out of the water.In recent years, the discolouration has become more visible further downstream and could affect the river’s ecologyleft untreated, the Coal Authority added.The Coal Authority has been working with the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyand other partners to monitor the problem and develop a solution.Details for planning approval will be submitted shortly, with a view to starting the main construction later this year.More detailed design work will be done in the coming months to develop the scheme, and residents and stakeholders will have the chance to provide feedback as the designs progress.John Batty, Coal Authority project manager, said: “I think a lot of residents are keen to see this project progress as the river is so visibly orange as a result of the mine water, and the negative impact on the wildle and ecology is widely known.“The mine workings are complex so it has taken many years to get to this point.“We have been working to carry out studies and investigations, evaluate potential solutions and establish water quality by taking water samples on a regular basis through the challenges of the pandemic.“We have undertaken research using a test treatment scheme on site last spring that provided a large amount of information to feed into the designs.”Paul Butler, SEPA mining sector lead, said: “We are pleased that the progress we have made together has enabled the Coal Authority to provide information on the proposals for a new mine water treatment scheme at the site of Junkies Adit.”Colin Beattie, MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh, said: “I think it is important that the public are involved with the process and it is vital public engagement continues as the scheme progresses.“I look forward to seeing the next stages of the treatment scheme and working with the Coal Authority, SEPA and the local community on this project.”Steven Dalgleish, of MDAA, said: “No faulting the Coal Authority’s commitment to the cause but the association remains gravely concerned that funding may not appear for this project.“From some of our own research, it seems that this may remain an issue for over

per cent.Pandemic isolation rules put further pressure on staff and the Ashiq family.Ferhan added: “Running a store of that size is quite an undertaking: you end up working -hour days, seven days a week for three years, no holidays, no breaks.“Isolation measures put pressure on staff members covering other shts and working much harder.”Thanking the Prestonpans community, the shop owner said: “Our family is so thankful to everyone who helped us achieve what we have in Prestonpans for the last  years.“This business put myself and my sister through education and we both went to university

Council to refuse planning permission for the flats, describing the new build as “over-dominant”.The proposal by Edinburgh-based BY Developments Ltd would see the bungalow on Gullane Main Street demolished and replaced by a passivhaus building containing four three-bedroom flats.In a letter to the local authority, the community council said that while it did not object to the idea of flats on the site, the current proposals were too big and it added that the design appeared to include windows which were just one metre from neighbouring houses, adding: “It is hard to imagine this providing adequate lighting.”The proposals to replace the house, known as Glen Maree, with the flats aims to make it as sustainable as possible, with its design statement describing the residential development as “net zero”.It will include electric car charging points at a private parking area to the rear of the property, solar  and non-fossil fuel heating systems.The roof design has been created to ensure maximum solar exposure to support the flats and the design statement points out that easy access to public transport is also available to new residents of the flats.It adds: “This development makes efficient use of land, buildings and infrastructure by altering a previously developed plot of land in a town centre rather than a greenfield site on the town periphery, for example.“Industry-leading Scottish cross laminated timber is to form the superstructure, whilst Passivhaus principals of airtightness, heat recovery and solar gain are to be employed to create very efficient, low-energy dwellings.“We believe this strategy will result in a very energy-efficient use of the plot, with the four new apartments using less energy than the existing building.“We intend to create an exemplar development that demonstrates sustainability without compromising design quality.”The design statement adds that the site itself is not in the Gullane Conservation Area but “on the periphery” of it.Despite plans to position the new building eight metres back from the Main Street pavement with a large front garden area, the community council said that the design did not fit the site.It said: “We have no issue with the general principle of creating flatted accommodation on the site.“The particular choice of design, creating four substantial flats across three floors rather than the two of the neighbouring houses, does appear to be over-dominant in scale.“Eventhe building were able to be set slightly further back this effect could be diminished, but the site appears not to lend itself to this.”The application is available to view on the council planning portal."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-gift-card-scheme-saw-sales-rocket-first-pandemic-christmas","story":"The East Lothian

Lothian Investments on behalf of the local authority as a year-round offer following the success of the council’s Christmas shop local campaign, which had run for a decade.Hundreds of cards were sold during its first two years however, the report has revealed that between October and December , , cards were sold, with an average spend of more than £ each.Mr McMillan said: “While we don’t have

businesses and the strong community spirit we have in East Lothian.“The gt card is a great way to support and encourage that ethos.”About  local businesses have signed up to accept the gt card in their stores, with no business charges applied to them.Pet shop owner Fiona Veerman said that the card had been a boost for local traders who were battling against online retailers.Fiona, who runs Veerman’s Pets  Co in Tranent, said: “We have always welcomed all customers into the shop with a smile, and we feel that this is especially important today as high streets up and down the country struggle to compete with online giants and out-of-town shopping centres.“We have been involved with the East Lothian Gt Card scheme from the outset, as it was created specically to encourage customers to think locally.“This is very important to us, as we also live in Tranent and know that money spent locally stays in the community.”No figures are available for the current financial year yet

It’s a great rush and really tasty and so much fun, butyou open another family-sized bag and keep eating them … it’s not going to be as much fun.”He looks around him at the other members of Franz Ferdinand and asks, “Am I losing the metaphor a bit ”Tuesday afternoon in Glasgow’s Theatre Royal and Franz Ferdinand are in the building. They’ve come here to have their photographs taken and to talk about now and then, past and present, hopes and dreams and why Morrissey might be a “w*****”. Unfortunately, there is no Haribo to hand.The night before I’d watched them play in front of an intimate audience of a few hundred in PJ Molloys in Dunfermline as part of Independent Venues Week. It was a reminder that nearly  years after they became the next big thing, and with a line-up that has changed over the years, the members of Franz Ferdinand still know how to put on a show. Bangerfollowed banger. A reminder of the band’s creative and commercial successes since their first hit Take Me Out in . And, in passing, a post-Covidreminder of just how thrilling live music can be.“I guess we took it for granted that we could play,” Kapranos admits. “And as I walked back on that stage last night, I really just savoured that moment and that sensation of being there, particularly in a smaller venue like that, being so close to people and having that communal shared experience. I’ve missed it so much.”After two years of relative inactivity, the band is releasing Hits to the Head next month, a greatest hits compilation of those aforementioned bangers plus a couple of new tunes, Billy Goodbye and Curious. They are also going on a European tour to promote it which will reach the UK towards the end of the year.All of which gives us a chance to ask who, what and why is Franz Ferdinand in  The who is easy. It’s now a five-piece, with original members Kapranos and Bob Hardy, joined by Dino Bardot, , who was previously in V-Twin, The s and Yummy Fur, and Julian Corrie, aka Miaoux Miaoux, who can remember watching Franz Ferdinand win the Mercury Prize on the telly .Both joined the band after Nick McCarthy left in . Last autumn drummer Paul Thomson handed over his drumsticks to newest member Audrey Tait . Apart from a fashion show for Balmain in Paris, the Dunfermline gig was her first official appearance with the band.Tait is the first to arrive today. She’s  , a Glaswegian and her own favourite greatest hits album, she tells me, is Greatest Hits by The Police. “I love Stewart Copeland’s drumming. I just love the style and the power that he has.”Since no one  has arrived I say, you can tell us about your initiation ceremony to join Franz Ferdinand  Did you have to shave your head  Or walk over hot coals “You’ve seen the pictures ” Tait says, laughing. “I wish I had an exciting story to tell you. I feel like maybe when we go on tour something will happen.”At which point the rest of the band tumble in the door. They’re all bright-eyed and sharp-dressed. Kapranoshas arrived in a Soviet-style coat covering double denim. And, yes, he pulls it off.Alex Kapranos Photograph Colin Mearns Upstairs, as they all pose enthusiastically for photos, they look exactly how a pop band should look like a gang. At one point Colin the photographer has Bardot and Corriestand at the back of the set-up. Then he worries that, because they’re both dressed in black, they look like bouncers.“That’s the first time anyone has said that about me,” Corrie says, mock-insulted.“I know Im getting into that club,” Kapranos says.The night before Kapranos had told Dunfermline that Franz Ferdinand are a Glasgow band. And it’s mostly true. The singer spends most of his off-duty time down near Dumfries these days and Corrie lives up in the Highlands, but the rest of the band are based in the city and Glasgow is part of their self-image.If I say the word Glasgow, I ask them as we convene post-photos, what does it mean to you all “Home, I suppose even though I don’t live here at the moment,” Kapranos begins.“I’m from Bradford,” Hardy adds, “but I’ve lived here half my le. It’s definitely home.”“It’s certainly the band’s home as well,” Kapranos adds. “When we asked Audrey to join the band, we wouldn’t have dreamed of looking anywhere  other than Glasgow to find someone to join the band.”As you might expect, Kapranos does most of the heavy lting in conversation, with Hardy adding an entertainingly flinty edge. Bob Hardy Andthe rest of the band are quieterthey are not quiet. And they’re all quite happy to take a hand out of the band’s time-served members. What did Franz Ferdinand mean to you before you joined, I ask the three of them at one point “Nothing,” Tait suggests to raucous laughter from the rest.“I was telling the guys when I was in first year at uni, Do You Want To was out and it was, in inverted commas, ‘my song’. So, when I was out and it came on everyone was like, ‘Oh, Audrey there’s your song.’ I’d be up doing the pointy fingers dance.”“See when you’re playing it live,” Kapranos interrupts, “do you have the instinct to …” He starts doing the pointy-finger dance himself.“I do,” Tait admits. Thinking back to the night before, she says, “I was this close to just standing up and going …”It’s a reminder that the band now has a history. It was also evident in Dunfermline the night before, Kapranos admits.“There was a young lad in the audience right down in the middle called Gordon. I was talking to Hamish [support act Hamish Hawk] about him before the gig and Hamish works in a record shop in Edinburgh and he said this young lad Gordon is always in the record shop. He’s a big music fan.“Gordon knew the words to every single song, even the new ones, every single word. Even Curious, which has only been up for listening to for a few days. And we were talking about him afterwards and he’s , which means he was five or six when our first record came out. That’s … a dficult thing to fully comprehend.”Well, indeed. Kapranos is  now, Hardy . They have lived several pop lives since they first started doing gigs in flats and derelict warehouses in Glasgow at the start of the century. Their first single Take Me Out was released in January . What followed was the Haribo years, you might say.I first met the band in the summer of , backstage at a festival near Leeds, where Kapranos told me that playing Top of the Pops was like losing his virginityand said that he thought Hardy would be the first person to leave Franz Ferdinand .I’ve brought along a copy of their  magazine cover story, just to ask Kapranos and Hardythey remember the younger men they were then.“Do I look any dferent ” Kapranos asks. “It’s a continuation of the same.” He looks at the cover. “It looks fun. It looks like they’re having a laugh.“I remember playing Leeds that year because Morrissey was on after us and I remember him getting an S-Class Mercedes from the Portakabin to the stage … Yeah. I was thinking, ‘I like the Smiths, but that’s the behaviour of a w*****.”Read More: Alex Kapranos talks to The Herald in That year must have been thrilling and disorientating for the band. The trajectory went stratospheric almost immediately. Suddenly they were in demand all around the world. The curtain was pulled back, and fame beckoned them in.“It was like stepping backstage and seeing it for all of its glory, or should I say lack of glory, or lack of glamour,” Kapranos suggests. “Because that’s kind of what backstage is. In people’s imagination backstage is this beautul, glamorous place, this ambrosia where we are all having a hell of a time …”“That’s the stage,” Hardy suggests.“Whereas backstage is actually just roadies in leather,” Kapranos continues. “But it was an astonishing time and experience.”Back to the present day. Sum up Franz Ferdinand in   “Same but dferent,” Kapranos argues.And what keeps them all going  “New music, it’s as simple as that really,” Hardy says. “Each time we come off the road we go our separate ways and then at some point Alex will send some demos and there will be a song in there. ‘Oh, that’s a good song. I’d like to be in that band.’”“You’ve got to be excited by it, otherwise there’s no point, is there ” asks Kapranos.Bandmates have left. The heady early days are in the past. Have there been points where he thought this mad adventure might be over, I ask the singer  “No. There were points where I thought I need to talk to Bob a bit, work some stuff out. So, we did.“But I’ve been writing tunes since I was very small. It’s just my thing, it’s what I do, and this band is great, and I really like being in it. It’s not really more complex than that.”What does success mean to Franz Ferdinand in the st century  “Gordon knowing all the words to all your songs in the front row,” Kapranos says.“It’s just the freedom to be yourself,” Hardy adds.That can’t always have been easy in a business where you are only as good as your last chart position. “There are pressures put on you,” Kapranos admits. “I remember when we released our first record. After six months [the band’s label] Domino couldn’t handle it in America anymore. It was too big for them, so we licensed it to a major label.“In the States we were on Epic, who are part of Sony, and that was a very dferent experience from working with Domino. They were putting a lot of pressure on us to do things that were … What was the term we came up with ” he asks Hardy. “Unnatural and cruel  Cruel and unusual ”“I think we learned quite quickly though,” Hardy says.“I think we’re tough enough to stand up to it,” Kapranos agrees, “but it wasn’t pleasant being in a situation where you have to stand up to it.”But, as both say, they always did things on their own terms. They didn’t have to conform to succeed.Imagine being Harry Styles, Kapranos says. “Having to break out of the boyband mould. To do that takes a hell of a strength of character. It must have been a very dficult thing to do. I’m glad we never had to do anything like that.”We are talking today in the wake of Neil Young and Joni Mitchell withdrawing their music from Spoty in protest of the streaming service hosting Joe Rogan’s podcast which has given a  to anti-vaxxer Robert Malone.Kapranos has been vocal on social media about this very thing himself. He spells it out today at greaterand with a flash of anger that is strikingly dferent from his normal demeanour.“I was talking about how absurd it is that we have these organisations that have so much power over the artist and it’s because the artist negotiates with them as iniduals rather than collectively. It’s maybe a good indicator how f****** useless musicians are at organising themselves, generally. It totally is, becauseyou look at the dynamics of scale artists absolutely outweigh these c**** who are ripping us off.”Its astonishing, Bardot suggests that someone [Joe Rogan in this case] who is just making a podcast ends up having the power in that situation.“Someone made the point that streaming services don’t see music and podcasts,” Corrie points out, “they just see it as audio. ‘What audio content can we sell ’”“If you want to reduce it to crude terms,” Kapranos says, picking up the baton again, “the ‘asset’ that is held by musicians ….” He pauses, thinks about what he has just said.“Butyou do look at it in terms like that, then the so-called assets are held by musicians. We have the power. In terms of scale, we have way more power. But we’re just so f****** useless at organising ourselves. We can’t put it into action.“How do you spur people on to realise that there is action that can be taken  I don’t know. You need one person to make the move and for others to follow and that hasn’t happened. And it doesn’t have to be Neil Young, it doesn’t have to be someone at the end of their career. It just has to be someone who can lead and motivate other people. And it’s not happening at the moment and it’s a little exasperating.”Are you volunteering, Alex “No. It has been going through my mind. If you think of other artists, most artists, they have no fear in front of thousands of people on a stage, yet they are intimidated by one organisation.”Corrie points to Tom Gray, from the band Gomez, who is also the founder of The Broken Record Campaign, currently lobbying the UK government on the piteous financial s to musicians offered by the streaming services. “He’s making things happen at a parliamentary level,” Corrie suggests.“For me there are two ways of doing it,” Kapranos says. “There’s Tom Gray’s method, which I have so much respect for, which is very organised and methodical. Or there’s the total anarchists’ revolt. ‘F*** you all, we’re not going to let you have our music,’ which appeals to me more.“I would love that. In my head it s to images of the playground and the playground bully and loads of little kids turning on the big kid and giving them a doing.”One more word to throw at them before they go, I say. Friendship. “We’ve always been a group of friends making music,” Hardy says. “What’s the alternative  It doesn’t sound fun.“When we tour, we spend so much time with each other. I can’t imagine doing that with a group of people you don’t get on with.”“We’ve definitely observed bands who are doing that,” Bardot adds, laughing.“I think the very fact that we can do an interview in a room together …” Kapranos concludes. “I know some bands who can’t.”He looks around at the rest of the band. “But they are all having their own tour buses.”How do we define Franz Ferdinand in   How about a band that can still laugh together  Thats an achievement in itself.Hits to the Head by Franz Ferdinand is released on March .

As children’s author Frank Cottrell-Boyce reminded us on Wonderlands, the latest Archive on  episode on Radio  last weekend, we might see children’s literature as timeless and ahistorical, but, he pointed out, “there’s a strong tradition in children’s writing that has always been deeply engaged with society.”As the recent Paddington films, with their celebration of the refugee in these post-Brexit times, reminded us, children’s literature has always had much to tell us about how we might see the world.“We are the products of our childhoods,” children’s author Tamara Macfarlane pointed out on Wonderlands. The messaging we absorb from the books we read at a young age, she added, “set up the beliefs and value systems for the next generation.”Dappled with archive interviews with the likes of Ursula Le Guin, Roald Dahl and, inevitably, JK Rowling, this sunny hour of radio was both a celebration of children’s fiction from Dickens to the present day and a clarion call to remind us of its importance.That importance can be commercial. One in three books sold in the UK these days are children’s books, Cottrell-Boyce pointed out, which means it is worth £billion to the economy.But more importantly the programme argued for the soft power of children’s literature how books can teach young readers about the reality of the world, about empathy for those that are dferent, or to simply provide a safe space when the world doesn’t feel very safe.Taking in everything from fantasy fictionto social realism , Cottrell-Boyce found common cause in all of them.Look again at care home resident Tracy Beaker, he said. “You’ll see that although the settings and the characters are a bracing breath of fresh air, there are big ideas that go right back to Dickens and further back to fairy tales. Bad parents, orphans, reverses of fortune. Tracey Beaker lives just around the corner from Tiny Tim and the Cratchetts.”And,you think about it, isn’t JK Rowling’s own story a fairy tale in its own way  As her publisher Barry Cunningham reminded us, when Rowling’s dog-eared Harry Potter manuscript landed on his desk, it was her last chance to find a home for it.“She hadn’t got a job, she was writing in cafes in Edinburgh, she was a single mum with no other source of income. So, I did say, ‘Look, the thing is Jo, you’ll have to get a day job because you’ll never make any money out of children’s books.’”Famous last words and all that.“The next generation will have their emotional and intellectual DNA shaped by the books they read,” Cottrell-Boyce suggested in a rousing conclusion. “That’s why this matters. It matters most of all for building future happiness. Children’s books help us to create our interior happy places. They build resilience. … The best children’s literature is an inoculation against any misery pandemic that might be coming.”Listen Out For: In the Studio, BBC World Service, Tuesday, .am .pm.

Sound familiar  Do you think of much beyond those well-loved song lyrics when you think about post Maybe not, but not to worry. That has been the job of Citizens Advice Scotland for the last  years while we have been the official advocate for postal consumers in Scotland. We have helped ensure the voice of Scottish postal consumers is represented, and any issues specic to Scotland are brought to the fore.I’ll admit when I first joined CAS my knowledge of postal issues wasn’t great. But it’s been amazing to be part of the ied work that CAS has undertaken to protect and enhance Scottish consumers’ access to postal services, and to effect change.We’ve worked on many dferent issues from: excessive parcel surcharging , access to post for vulnerable groups, access to post offices, what services consumers should expect under the universal postal service, post office outreach services, and many more. We’ve done this by commissioning research, engaging with the postal sector, and running campaigns.With a new body taking on this responsibility from April we’re reflecting on what we’ve achieved and the dference we’ve made.An issue that still remains today is parcel surcharging, where charges can be higher for consumers in parts of the Highlands and Islands compared to the rest of mainland Britain. We’ve worked with other stakeholders on this issue for a number of years. We’ve supported a compliance review of online retailers which resulted in enforcement notices being issued, highlighted this practice and our research in the Scottish and UK Parliaments, and supported campaigning alongside Citizens Advice Bureaux on the local impact of this issue.Affordability is another key issue, and this is even more important today as the cost of living hikes start to take effect. In  we achieved real progress on this when the cost of postal redirections was reduced for those on Universal Credit and eligibility widened. This was a great result, and we’ll continue to advocate for more affordable rates for those in challenging financial situations.Another great result was Ofcom agreeing to implement stronger protections for parcel customers so they are treated more fairly. The pandemic made post even more crucial so its vital no-one is left behind.Being able to afford post is one thing, but whatyou can’t even get post delivered to you  Unfortunately, this is still a reality for some vulnerable groups in Scotland and the impacts of this can be huge. It can touch on all aspects of someone’s le from finances, housing, health information, to support to remain in the UK. Everyone should be able to safely access their post in Scotland no matter their situation. CAS continues to work to make sure this happens, particularly now with delivery issues linked to COVID again impacting consumers.So next time you decide toto sender or receive a letter from America remember there is much more to the post than that, and there are people out there working to ensure Scottish postal consumers voices are heard.Gillian Fyfe leads the Strong Communities team at Citizens Advice Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-238-todays-wordle-february-12-hints","story":"The aim of the game is to find a  letter word in only six attempts.The game uses the same rules as Scrabble, where only real words are allowed both in guesses and the result.If you get a letter in the right spot and from the correct word, the square turns green.Butthe guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot, the square turns yellow.Letters which are wrong turn grey to help the process of elimination for the six tries.If you’re still trying to save your streak, then don’t scroll down yet, maybe some hints will send you on your way.Today’s word starts with the letter U and ends with the letter A.Todays Wordle hint is the following clue: an extreme version of something.It contains two vowels.If you have given up on today’s game, then we can save you the misery.

With these teams experiencing wildly contrasting Six Nations opening weekends, you would have been hard-pressed to find a punter in red or navy blue around Cardf yesterday morning ready to bet big on the home side. But last year’s champions – even with  caps worth of experience currently out injured – had not become a bad team overnight. They are limited, but they needed this win – and in front of a febrile crowd of over , they found a way to achieve their goal. The decisive moment in the match might have been the yellow carding of Finn Russell with the scores tied and just over  minutes to play, but we shouldn’t overlook that this was the act of a desperate man who cracked under the pressure Wales were exerting at that point. A positive start from Scotland featured Matt Fagerson brushing off Taine Basham in the first minute to take play into the Welsh strike zone, but Darcy Graham lost the ball in contacts which allowed Owen Watkin to break from deep. He was supported by Dan Biggar and Tomos Williams, and Stuart Hogg was perhaps lucky not to be sanctioned for a deliberate knock-on which stopped this promising home attack. WP Nel was penalised for collapsing at the resulting scrum and Biggar stepped forward to fire Wales into a - lead, which will have settled nerves after last weekend’s heavy defeat to Ireland. Russell then kicked the restart out on the full which allowed the hosts to charge straight back onto the offensive, and Biggar doubled his own and his team’s account with the game still not eight minutes old, when Scotland were penalised for not rolling away. Ali Price’s flat pass to release Duhan van de Merwe up the left touchline ignited the Scottish fight-back, and that move was finished off  phases later on the opposite side of the park when a classic Russell miss-two pass gave Graham the sliver of space he needed to scramble past Louis Rees-Zammit and dot down in the corner. Russell couldn’t manage the tricky conversion, but he nailed a penalty from in front of the posts a few minutes later when Welsh debutant Jac Morgan were penalised for being in front of his kicker, and the Scotland quickly repeated the trick when Wales were penalised for coming in at the side to slow a line-out maul. It had been a good -minute spell for Scotland, but Wales were never going to just roll over and they struck next when Grant Gilchrist was penalised for falling on the wrong side of a tackler right in front of his own posts, and Biggar kicked the easy points. That score was almost immediately cancelled out by Russell after a Hamish Watson jackal earned a holding-on penalty for Scotland against Basham, who had been trying to run a sloppy line-out overthrow away from Wales danger zone, before a brilliant - from Liam Williams swung momentum back towards the home team. When Scotland – Sam Skinner on this occasion – were penalised for the third time in the match for lying on the wrong side, prompting a team warning from referee Nic Berry, it allowed Biggar to kick to the corner and Tomas Francis got the ball down after a powerful line-out maul. That squared the match with just over half an hour played, and it stayed that way until half-time. Scotland struck first after the break when another long passage of play, featuring powerful surges from Sione Tuipulotu and Graham, eventually yielded a not-rolling away penalty which Russell fired home from in front of the posts. But Biggar squared it again when George Turner– one third of Scotlands front-row bomb-squad which had been deployed off the bench on  minutes – was penalised for offside. The nd minute brought Rory Darge his long-awaited international debut off the bench in place of Jonny Gray, but it wasnt the triumphant experience he will have spent years dreaming of. A few minutes later, a long-range penalty from Biggar rebounded back off the bar and Alex Cuthbert was first on the scene to scoop up the loose ball. Chris Harris managed to snuff out the immediate threat, but Wales kept banging at the door and the TMO was required to rule that Cuthberts foot had strayed into touch as he ed for glory in the corner a few phases later. No try, but Russell was sent to the sin bin for a deliberate knock-on earlier on the move and Wales ran the penalty, which created the  for Biggar to drop the goal which sealed the win with  minutes to go.  Teams – Wales: L Williams A Cuthbert, O Watkin, N Tompkins , L Rees-Zammit D Biggar , T Williams W Jones , R Elias , T Francis , W Rowlands , A Beard, T Basham, J Morgan, R Moriarty . Scotland: S Hogg D Graham, C Harris, S Tuipulotu , D van der MerweF Russell, A PriceP Schoeman , S McInally , W Nel , J Gray , G Gilchrist, S Skinner, H Watson, M Fagerson . Referee: Nic Berry Scorers – Wales: Try: Francis Pens: Biggar  DG: Biggar. Scotland: Tries: Graham Pen: Russell . Scoring sequence : - - - - - - - -- - -."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

Every time I came back to check on her, there would be an owl or a squirrel. She’s fantastic. “All of the team had dferent skills, it’s a bit like The Avengers.”First up on Loggerheads is furniture maker Linzi St Clair Thompson, who has worked on everything from antique restorations and bespoke furniture commissions to a video set for pop star Harry Styles.Along with her two team-mates, the -year-old is aiming to create a place for the forestry rewilding group to relax in Glenlude Forest in the Borders. Her opponents, Mexican-born Vicente Ridaura-Harvey’s team, want to build a woodland workshop.“It was a fantastic experience,” she said of the show. “I feel so lucky to have toured six fantastic locations all over Scotland and with such like-minded people.“Everything we were taking down was either to thin out the woodland to make space for native trees or for health and safety reasons. It felt really nice to be leaving something behind for the community to enjoy. “Working in Scone was quite special because I’m from Perthshire, so it felt like home.”When she isn’t making bespoke furniture, she helps build sets for theatre and TV and has worked on videos for The Proclaimers, Men In Kilts and Harry Styles.“He was such a gent and so patient with the Scottish weather,” she said. “We were filming the video for Adore You in St Anne’s so it wasn’t always the best conditions. “I’m always looking for something new to do and it’s something dferent every single time.”: Both sides of the rewilding debate are wrong, says expert Judges praised the intricate carved lettering in the beautul daybed her team creates in the first episode. She said: “They’ve got a brilliant re-plantation programme and we wanted to create a really relaxing space where people were just reminded to breathe and relax and take in nature. “The mental health benefits of being in a forest and forest bathing, is really important – especially now with a mental health crisis going on.”l Loggerheads, which has been produced by Mighty Productions Scotland, will start on BBC Scotland on Thursday at .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"February ,  at : pmThe community and its aspirations will be at the heart of major investment in Orkney’s footpath and cycle network.

It’s very clear though, the rules of Wales apply when you’re in Wales.”The minister criticised the Prime Minister for “ambushing” the devolved governments and even his own Cabinet members with the decision about scrapping self-isolation rules, and suggested such moves were a barrier to a closer working relationship between the two governments.Responding to the claims, Mr Davies said: “The Welsh Government have been present at Cobra meetings where a lot of the decisions have been taken, so they know exactly how we’ve arrived at the decisions.“They have not allowed the UK Government equal access to meetings at which they take decisions. So we never have a clue what they’re about to do.“We should be working more closely together and it’s an absolute crying shame that we can’t, and that instead of working closely, they’re determined to take every opportunity to attack the UK Government and drive a wedge between the UK Government and Wales.”On the same day as PMQs, the House of Commons Welsh Affairs Committee heard evidence from experts about intergovernmental relations, including Philip Rycroft CB, former permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union, who said the Covid- pandemic had been a “huge missed opportunity”.Mr Rycroft, also the former head of the UK Governance Group at the Cabinet Office, said: “I think it all began to fracture in about May , when the Prime Minister was on the TV making announcements about changes to the rules and regulations without it being clear whether he was speaking about England or the whole of the UK. That is the moment this began to crumble.“As I said, that was a huge missed opportunity, and when the history books are written about this, I think it will be seen as such.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

However, the Prime Minister — currently on a charm offensive as part of a mission to restore his reputation — has said he expects the last domestic rules in England could end earlythe data permits. Boris Johnson made the announcement on Wednesday, as Robin Swann was still waiting for an expert assessment on whether he can press ahead with lting restrictions in Northern Ireland.Read MoreRobin Swann has ‘no plans’ to ditch Covid testing and isolation rules in NIEarlier this week, the Health Minister told a press briefing that he wants to lt most, “ not all” remaining measures. Key to all of this, however, is the legal and public health advice he receives. It is understood that even as late as Wednesday night he hadn’t been given the green light to press ahead with relaxations and it isn’t entirely clear what this will entaillawyers tell him he has the power to act without Executive approval. If this proves to be the case, Mr Swann then has to decide which restrictions he will lt.Among the rules that remain are the controversial Covid certicate scheme for nightclubs, a minimum self-isolation period for people who test positive, a legal requirement to wear face coverings in indoor public spaces, and the regular use of lateral flow tests. Given Mr Johnson’s comments on Wednesday, there was hope that Mr Swann would follow suit, but a spokeswoman from the Department of Health on Wednesday night poured cold water on any such suggestion. “There are no immediate plans for changes to the current arrangements for testing, contact tracing and isolation in Northern Ireland,” she said. “All aspects of test and trace are kept under active review.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up However, while this may be Mr Swann’s preferred position, his hands may be forced on the matterMr Johnson scraps lateral flow testsin England. To date, NI’s supply has come from England and it will be dficult for the UUP minister to make a case to the public that they should pay for LFTs as it is unlikely Westminster will pay outthey aren’t in use across the water. The only other alternative would be for Stormont to pick up the cost — and given the current political instability, it’s anyone’s guess whether that would even be possible.As it stands, Covid- is still re in Northern Ireland.Given current testing arrangements, the actual number of positive cases is likely to be signicantly higher than those on the Department of Health’s dashboard. Realistically, how many people are actually recording positive LFT results Mercully, Omicron has not turned out to be as dangerous as first feared — at least to most people. But there are still tens of thousands of people here who are clinically extremely vulnerable and for whom the vaccinations may not provide effective protection.Many have had to shield and make extraordinary sacrices to stay safe over the past two years. While the wider population is looking forward to a e to normal, it is these very changes and relaxations that will force the clinically vulnerable to retreat even more from the world.Related topicsDepartment of HealthRobin SwannBoris JohnsonMore On Department of HealthRobin Swann seeks fellow ministers’ views on lting Covid- rulesNI health trusts short of almost  permanent consultants, according to BMA vacancy reportMore than , calls to Leline helpline in Northern Ireland last year, new figures revealRobin Swann has ‘no plans’ to ditch Covid testing and isolation rules in NICoronavirus Northern Ireland: What restrictions could be lted tomorrow Most Read‘It was so harrowing’ – priest who attended tragic car crash scene deeply moved by courage of -year-old boy#s familyUUP’s Robbie Butler defends attendance at Dromore anti-NI protocol rally following social media criticismStena Line ‘astonished’ by volume of applicants for new Irish Sea-crossing jobsBBC NI presenters topping up pay packets with money-spinning external engagementsBobby Singleton: PSNI chief with arresting good looks inspires Valentine’s Day cardTop VideosPlayHas living under Covid restrictions changed our lives for the better PlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominationsPlayTattoo artist inks pet portrait onto owners leg  years after rescuing dogLatest Northern IrelandKilcoo vs Kilmacud Crokes: Updates from All-Ireland senior club football final at Croke ParkTwo held as cocaine and cannabis worth £.m seized at Belfast HarbourLittle chance of progress over protocol before elections, DUP leader warnsHow Mickey Moran earned respect from across the GAA as he prepares to lead Kilcoo into All-Ireland Club finalBig Two reaction: Mick McDermott warns that Glentoran have not dealt ‘fatal’ blow as Linfield still believe in title hopesLatestKilcoo vs Kilmacud Crokes: Updates from All-Ireland senior club football final at Croke ParkScotland suffer more misery in Cardf as Wales reignite Six Nations challengePutin and Biden hold high-stakes phone call over Ukraine crisisRalf Rangnick insists Man Utd need to be ‘more aggressive and even more nasty’Harry Styles spotted filming in large bed in front of Buckingham Palace,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s very clear though, the rules of Wales apply when you’re in Wales.”The minister criticised the Prime Minister for “ambushing” the devolved governments and even his own Cabinet members with the decision about scrapping self-isolation rules, and suggested such moves were a barrier to a closer working relationship between the two governments.Responding to the claims, Mr Davies said: “The Welsh Government have been present at Cobra meetings where a lot of the decisions have been taken, so they know exactly how we’ve arrived at the decisions.“They have not allowed the UK Government equal access to meetings at which they take decisions. So we never have a clue what they’re about to do.“We should be working more closely together and it’s an absolute crying shame that we can’t, and that instead of working closely, they’re determined to take every opportunity to attack the UK Government and drive a wedge between the UK Government and Wales.”On the same day as PMQs, the House of Commons Welsh Affairs Committee heard evidence from experts about intergovernmental relations, including Philip Rycroft CB, former permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union, who said the Covid- pandemic had been a “huge missed opportunity”.Mr Rycroft, also the former head of the UK Governance Group at the Cabinet Office, said: “I think it all began to fracture in about May , when the Prime Minister was on the TV making announcements about changes to the rules and regulations without it being clear whether he was speaking about England or the whole of the UK. That is the moment this began to crumble.“As I said, that was a huge missed opportunity, and when the history books are written about this, I think it will be seen as such.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

We have to follow the example of St Patrick and bring the light to recallsothers.ldquoWe have to start again, bringing the light of Christ into our hearts, our families and into our homes. We all know these are days of darkness, we have been living through them, days of fear and anxiety. We need the joy of the gospel, the joy of Christ, joy brought to Ireland by St Patrick.Fr Alexander continued: ldquoEach of us has to ask ourselves, what am I going to do to bring the light of faith to others  Generations of our ancestors kept the faith alive. What are you going to do to keep the faith alive  Let us revive our faith and go forward with St Patrick.Archbishop Jude Thaddeus told the congregation that St Patrick was not sent by to Ireland ldquoby God by chance.ldquoHis mission in Ireland was a deliberate intention of God, he continued. ldquoWe can read this in St Patrickrsquos writings and from the example he left behind. When St Patrick wanted to come back to Ireland, there was a lot of opposition. In his time, there were many missionaries, including bishops and priests. We have hardly heard of many of these, but we all know about St Patrick. This is very striking. Why is it so ldquoSt Patrick did not speak much, he didnrsquot write much. Today there are too many words ndash words, words, words ndash written words, spoken words, words on the internet, words on the microphone, words on the streets and the market places. There are too many words, just one word is important ndash the Word of God. If we could just listen to even a single Word of God.Referring to the Gospel readings for the feast of Candlemas, the Papal Nuncio added: ldquoOur Lady did not say anything at the Presentation of Our Lord, she kept everything in her heart. In the entire Gospel. St Joseph speaks only two words. Sometimes we speak too many words and we lose orientation and get confused. Only one word is important ndash the Word of God ndash we should listen to the Word of God. St Patrick listened to the Word of God.Speaking afterwards of his visit, Archbishop Okolo said: ldquoIt was indeed nice and uplting, praying together on that holy ground, on which St Patrick trod.Next week, the All Ireland Novena journeys to Slane where St Patrick lit the Paschal fire.The Novena can be watched online at pm via the parish webcam..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9Feburary2020_Panto.jpg","title":"Children on stage for The Wizard of Oz show  ","story":"THE abundance of musical and dramatic talent at the Patrician Youth Centre in Downpatrick is back on show for the first time in almost two years.A young and enthusiastic cast presented the pantomime, The Wizard of Oz, last week.Performing Arts and live productions at the Patrician paused in March  with the onset of Covid- and ensuing pandemic.Determined to get going again, staff and members worked on Tom Whalleyrsquos new pantomime production of the very popular musical The Wizard of Oz.Despite many ongoing Covid disruptions were delighted to have a performance which was live streamed last week.Unfortunately, in the lead-up to the event some of the principal cast members were Covid isolating.On the day before the performance leading lady Shona Gardiner, who was to play Dorothy, tested positive.In true showbiz tradition, the show had to go on and a telephone call from a former Patrician member saved the day.Mairead OrsquoHare, who played Dorothy in the Patricianrsquos  production of the Wizard of Oz, volunteered to stand in to read the role and sing the ever-popular songs. Mairead ed and performed like she never had been away.Senior youth worker Yvonne Maguire congratulated everyone connected with the production mdash the cast members, production team, friends of Patrician, parents, and families for supporting members, children and young people.She extended a sincere thank you to Mairead for standing in at the last minute and also paid tribute to Shona, who had worked so hard in preparing for the performance and regrettably did not get the opportunity to star.A recording of Shona singing will be available on Facebook.The principal cast members were: Mairead OrsquoHare , Aaron Mullan , Aedan OrsquoHare , Annie May OrsquoHare , Eamon OrsquoHare , Eva Bailie , Tyler Fung , Zoe Gaines .Chorus, dancers, monkeys, trees and crows: Caitie Cunlfe, Caragh Moore, Conal McDowell, Ella Grace Cunlfe, Emily Douglas, Georgia Savage, Jack McDonald, Katie Fegan, Kayleigh Rogers, Lilly Boyd, Maria Rooney, Megan Megahey, Molly Boyd, Molly Madine, Oisin OrsquoHare, Poppy Baggley, Poppy Woodall.Patrician Youth Centre would also like to thank the following staff team and friends for making the production possible: Caitriona Smyth, Anthony Frew, Bridin Wells, Eamonn Hanlon, Charlie Hanlon, David McBennett, Melissa Poland, Paddy Watters, Mark Hassett, Anna Murray and Teresa Sweeney.Thanks are also extended other team members and the centre trainee leader membership who supported the event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_Sea.jpg","title":"Drive for better sea swimming facilities  ","story":"A SERIES of measures to improve the safety of sea swimmers in Newcastle have been suggested to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The local authority has been asked to address the needs of the increasing numbers who enjoy swimming at the resortrsquos harbour.Council officials met recently with Mournes councillor Laura Devlin who is working to secure improved access to the water and the needs of those who enjoy cold water swimming.Cllr Devlin said while sea swimming has always been popular in the resort, there is an increasing number of people taking to the water as a result of Covid which prompted many people across the district to be more active.She said Newcastlersquos Harbour Heritage Association is bringing many people who use services at the harbour together to provide them with a ldquounied voice with the group including representatives of the sea swimming community.ldquoCold water therapy is now an established activity and the coronavirus pandemic will unfortunately have a lasting impact on mental health, continued Cllr Devlin.ldquoThis type of therapy is seen as a successful line of defence and even treatment for many, notwithstanding the superb physical benefits and enjoyment that cold water swimming brings.Cllr Devlin says there are many activities at Newcastle harbour which can sometimes lead to a congested slipway, explaining that there are ldquosignicant safety concerns when swimmers, boats and jet-skis are in the water at once.The local councillor, who met recently with council officials and was joined by local sea swimmer Fiona Davey, has also highlighted parking problems at the harbour which she said are ldquocontinuing to deteriorate.She continued: ldquoI have also consulted with The Harbour Heritage Association and we agreed a list of issues that need to be addressed which the local authority which is considering improvements to the water access point on the harbour side of the Rock Pool or at the Back Shore.ldquoAn extension of the ramp leading to the water is also required to allow for disability access, while a handrail to assist people entering and exiting the water as well as hooks for clothes and storage, and a seating area for changing is also required.Council officials have also been asked to provide buoys near the pier to section off the area for those jumping into the water and sea swimming in general.Cllr Devlin also highlighted the need for height markers on the pier wall in order that those who jump into the water will know the depth, explaining the water depth can be an issue during the summer months.Council officials have also been asked to provide distance markers, so swimmers know how far out they are.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoThis is a flavour of our asks and really is just a starting point. I donrsquot see any of the issues that have been highlighted as costing a signicant amount. If they can be implemented, they would make a tangible dference to harbour users. I hope that progress can be made soon for the good of all harbour users.Thanking Cllr Devlin for her work to improve safety for sea swimmers at the harbour, South Down MLA Colin McGrath said he looked forward to ldquomuch-needed changes in Newcastle.He also believes that the series of measures outlined for the harbour could be used as a template by the local authority for open water swimming and cold water therapy across the district.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are fortunate to be surrounded by such beautul coastline which has many locations for accessing the water, but itrsquos vital that we make the activity as safe as possible in a select number of locations that ensure an equitable offering across the council area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 12th%2C 1992  ","story":"ARDGLASS ndash The fishing fleet in Ardglass is facing a potential crisis following a slump in the crucially-important prawn market.Demand for prawns has ped dramatically because of the recession, resulting in depressed prices and trawler men struggling to meet running costs.Yesterday, fishermenrsquos leader Dick James said: ldquoWe are not yet in a crisis, but one is fast developing.Mr James, who is chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, has called on the Government to introduce a decommissioning scheme which would enable trawler owners to leave the industry.ldquoA decommissioning scheme would go a long way towards solving the problem. At present, we have too many boasts chasing too few fish, he remarked.Ironically, the situation has been partly caused by the fishermen catching too many prawns.Last monthrsquos good weather resulted in better-then-expected landing which further depressed the already-weakened market ndash prawn are currently selling at less than pound a stone, compared to pound a stone a year ago.However, the general recession in the economy has been the main stumbling block. As demand continues to drop, processors are keeping stocks in cold storage and are not in a position to buy additional supplies at the quayside.ldquoWe had good prices until last April. Then the market slumped and prices drop. Unfortunately, fishermanrsquos costs havenrsquot come down accordingly, Mr James said.Mr James said depression in other sectors of the industry has heightened the problem.He also believes the decommission scheme has the support of most trawler owners in Ardglass.ldquoWe are talking about the survival of the fleet as a whole. Decommissioning would help owners who are otherwise unable to get out of the industry.ldquoAnd because most of the boats are undermanned, it would to not lead to large scale redundancies among crewmen, he added.CROSSGAR ndash A Crossgar man who is renowned for his excellent time-keeping was honoured last week.Mr James McCormick, who has been winding the clock on the old Kilmore Parish Church Hall for over  years, has decided to hang up his key and retire from his conscientious job.James took over the job when the clock was repaired in  and has continued his labour of love ever since.Now the hall has been sold to the Ulster Wildle Trust for its new headquarters building, James has decided tocall it a day and has retired from his winding duties.In recognition of his timeless work over the years the development officer of the Wildle Trust, Mr Niall Timmins, presented Mr McCormick with a window box of herbs to remind him of his former winding le.STRANGFORD ndash The creation of a single committee to oversee the management of Strangford Lough has been widely welcomed.The Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, Mr John Taylor, said the announcement represents a ldquomajor U-turn by the Government, while the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association described it as a ldquoserious attempt to ensure the future of the lough.The new committee is to be launched in the spring and will have a membership of around  drawn from special interest groups, such as agriculture, fishing, conservation and recreation.Member will also be appointed from nominations put forward by Down District and Ards Borough Councils, the National Trust and the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside.The announcement marks something of a turn-around by the Environment Minister, Mr Richard Needham, who less than six months ago proposed a two-tier management structure for the lough.The proposal was widely criticised by groups who argued that such a structure would be unwieldy and would prevent local people from having a proper influence over decision making.By scrapping that approach, Mr Needham appears to have bowed to local pressure. The Minister says the new initiative has been produced ldquofollowing extensive consultation with organisations and iniduals concerned with the future of Strangford Lough.SAINTFIELD ndash Work is to start next week leading to the provision of new traffic lights in Saintfield.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, said yesterday that preliminary work will begin on Monday for the provision of the lights at the main crossroads in the town.ldquoI welcome this commitment. At long last we are to get these light, he said.After meeting Roads Service officials, Mr Biggerstaff also announced progress on a number of other projects in the Saintfield area.He said the provision of a footpath along Middle Road is to go forward to the Departmentrsquos forward planning section, as well similar provision on the Ballynahinch Road, Saintfield, as far as Ballymaconnell Road.Mr Biggerstaff said he had also been assured that a footpath extension from Lislane Park to the new build on the Listooder Road, taking in the primary school area will ldquodefinitely happen this year.The Ulster Unionist councillor has also asked officials to carry out a study into a serious flooding problem during periods of heavy rain at Carsonstown Road Killybawn Road.NEWCASTLE ndash Down councillor, Mr John Ritchie, has claimed that the Eastern Health Board consultation process is the ldquokiss of death for Mourne House.In a strong address to the Eastern Health Council attacking the closer plan for Mourne House, Mr Ritchie said that in his experience consultation rarely results in a change to such a proposal.Mr Ritchie claimed the unit of management has looked at the Mourne House scenario from a narrow perspective and he voiced concern about the future of the elderly people in the outlying parts of the community.It was the local councillor who asked for the Mourne House issue to be put on the Council agenda for Thursdayrsquos meeting and he dominated the  minute discussion.During his address Mr Ritchie suggested the implementation of a two-year programme to deal with the renovations and the building could then be used as a base for a community care programme.Mr Ritchie explained that Mourne House first came to light in the dying days of the last Eastern Health Board when the policy and planning committee considered a plan for the Down and Lisburn Unit of Management.The proposal included reducing the number of beds to  and developing Mourne House as a base for a community care package with respite care, a  place day centre, and meals on wheels.Mr Ritchie said there were a whole range of suggestions which the Board felt made a ldquovery attraction option.CLOUGH ndash The Presbyterian congregation in Clough held a thanksgiving service on Sunday to bid farewell to their  year-old church hall which is being replaced.The hall which was built in , is being demolished to make way for a new hall which will be officially opened by the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church, the Rev Rodney Sterritt, in April.The services was conducted by the Rev Robert Craig, church minister, who researched the origins and construction of the hall at the turn of the century.The hymn, psalm and ure reading were the same as those used at the opening service.The ious organisations which used the hall over the years were remembered, including the Scouts and Guides, Boysrsquo and Girlsrsquo Brigades, the Girlsrsquo auxiliary, and the badminton, bowls and table tennis clubs.The congregation also remembered the many services and church socials which were held in the hall.In his address, Mr Craig pointed to the strong links between the current congregation and that of a bygone age.He said many of the original families still reside in the Clough area and belong to the congregation.Mr Craig said the congregation is still industrious and is currently busy erecting and paying for the new hall. He also pointed to the faith which has united the generations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Head teachers take part in two day leadership event  ","story":"HEAD teachers from post-primary schools across the South Eastern area took part in a two-day conference last week in Newcastle.The event at the Burrendale Hotel focused on leadership, building resilience, promoting health and well-being amongst staff and students, child protection issues and supporting children and young people to get the best educational start in le.A core theme of the conference was on ldquorestarting, rebuilding and adapting the education system coming out of a global pandemic.Mr Paul Marks, principal of The High School Ballynahinch and current chairman of the South Eastern Secondary Heads Association, described the conference as a ldquoreally important opportunity for school leaders to reflect on the challenges and key opportunities of the past two years.ldquoIt is so important that principals meet to discuss our recovery out of the Covid- pandemic and how we can continue to best support all of our pupils to realise their full potential, he said.Education Authority chief executive Sara Long mdash who opened the conference mdash paid tribute to the leadership and tireless efforts of all school principals and staff throughout the pandemic.She thanked them for their ldquooutstanding commitment, dedication and resilience in the face of the most dficult of circumstances.She said children and young people, staff and school communities remained ldquosteadfastly at the heart of everything schools do.ldquoYou transitioned seamlessly to remote and blended learning, prepared for a number of school restarts, navigated through ever-changing public health advice and policies and managed very high volumes of Covid- cases in your schools, said the chief executive.ldquoYou managed this against the back of signicant staffing shortages and ensured that all young people received the appropriate grade at GSCE and A-Level through rigorous assessment, due diligence and hard work by you and your teaching staff.Ms Long also acknowledged how dficult the journey had been and the impact that all this had on head teachers should not be ignored.ldquoThat is why I want to stress my commitment in continuing to look at how we can best support school leaders, build strong partnerships and networks and to promote and champion health and wellbeing, she added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_Kilmore.jpg","title":"Kilmore move to second place in title race for Division 1A trophy  ","story":"KILMORE Rec established themselves as serious title contenders after they defeated current table toppers Comber Rec at a wet and windy Robert Adams Park on Saturday.Despite missing a first half penalty, The Blues dusted themselves down and found the crucial goal through their captain, Niall McCarthy, which was enough to separate the sides in what was a very physical encounter between the two rivals.It was the home side who kicked off the affair and immediately it was clear to both sets of supporters that they were in for an action packed  minutes of football.Comber striker Matthew Tumilson stung the hands of Kilmore lsquokeeper Christopher Turley early on before Gary Kennedy tried his luck from range for the hosts.Although the worsening conditions made the pitch notably heavy, the quality of football on display didnrsquot decline to the credit of both outfits.In fact, the heavy and cut up grass resulted in a cuter range of passing with the minutes on the training pitch preparing for such scenarios put into full effect.However, Kilmore soon had other worries when defender Kennedy was forced off just  minutes into play as a result of an injury. Fortunately for The Blues they had an able replacement in Christopher Magee.This early unsettlement, along with the travelling support, spurred the away side on and soon the league leaders were showing why they are just that.Gareth Keenan was denied a golden opportunity courtesy of a point blank save from Turley as Comber continued to apply pressure in the early stages. Kilmore responded well to this and remained calm on the ball.Following some quick passing from Matthew Stewart to team-mate Anton McGrattan, the Kilmore number ten played in strike partner Joe McKinney, who was adjudged to have been fouled in the danger area and won a penalty kick.Kilmorersquos McGrattan stepped up but his effort was fantastically saved by the outstretching Andrew Topping, who pushed the ball around the post and out for a corner to the frustration of the home fans.The resultant corner was headed over the Comber crossbar by Kilmore defender Jack Larkin as the away side relished in escaping potential punishment.The visitors went back in search of the opening goals immediately after, with Keenan again seeing his efforts thwarted by the Kilmore custodian.The game quickly developed into an end to end contest with chances coming thick and fast at both ends.Kilmorersquos McKinney saw his headed effort go wide with the goal seemingly gaping before his left footed effort blazed over the bar after he was neatly played through by McGrattan.Comberrsquos Brandon Nelson delivered an inviting corner to the head of team-mate Stuart Moore, although he failed to make the most of his chance.Despite the weather, things began heating up on the pitch with numerous crunching tackles on display.Kilmore captain, Niall McCarthy, escaped with just a warning following his high challenge on Comber winger Nelson although the visiting sidersquos Moore wasnrsquot as lucky after he was awarded a yellow for clattering substitute Magee.A new face was on show within the Kilmore ranks in the form of midfielder Barry Walsh. The former Killyleagh YC player impressed throughout his debut and controlled the middle of the park at ious stages throughout the game.With both the tempo and tensions high, the whistle sounded a full two minutes early to signal half-time.Comber kicked off after the interval but it was the hosts who would be awarded the first big chance of the half.Following a piercing run into the opposing defence, Kilmorersquos McKinney was brought down awarding team-mate McGrattan to test lsquokeeper Topping from  yards with the resultant free-kick.However, the Comber custodian wasnrsquot required to spring into action as the ball whisked past the wrong side of the upright.The visitors seemed to be pressed further back into their half and attempted to respond quickly.Dylan Wilson smartly dispatched of the ball on a quick counter-attack to team-mate and captain, Simon Hanna, although the number eight was halted in his tracks unfairly by Magee.For this, the Kilmore defender was the latest name to enter the refereersquos books. The home side had the advantage of the wind and decided to use this repeatedly through long ranged passes in hopes of manufacturing an attack.McKinney came close on a few occasions as he engaged in multiple footraces with Comberrsquos Reece Whittle, although often the home striker would stray onto the bounds of offside.Kilmore hit a purple patch in the opening quarter of the second half, with Comberrsquos first chance of the restart coming on the hour mark.Nelson was left unmarked at the back post after a ball was lofted into his path from skipper Hanna. However, he shanked his left-footed effort and allowed his Kilmore counterparts to remain unscathed.Despite this miss, Nelsonrsquos effort served as a reminder to the opposition that Comber was very much still a threat on the counter.The Kilmore support were up in arms minutes later when they thought a Comber hand was used to prevent a McGrattan strike from hitting its target, although these appeals were quickly shut down.Comber substitute, Ciaran Gillan, picked up a yellow card in his attempts to clear the ball from his half ndash much to the disagreement of his sidersquos management team.The visitors would be soon ruing more than a yellow card as the resultant free-kick proved costly on the  minute mark.A delicately placed McGrattan delivery floated into the path of captain McCarthy for the Kilmore skipper to head with conviction past Topping and finally open the scoring.Anton McGrattan picked up a rather needless yellow soon after for thumping the ball away amongst the celebrations as the atmosphere inside the park reached fever pitch.Comber defender Bradley Porter received a yellow card minutes later for his tackle on McKinney before the Kilmore striker suffered the same fate after he ended up on the ground in what the referee deemed as simulation.The trend of yellow cards continued with Comber captain Hanna, who landed his name in the book for exchanging some ill-advised words with the official ten minutes from full-time.As expected, the final minutes of the contest were a nervous affair for the home side, who werenrsquot committing as many bodies forward in hopes of securing a shutout.Naturally, this invited pressure from Comber, who desperately sought to spoil the Kilmore party.lsquoKeeper Turley kept his concentration for the full duration of the match and thwarted the last two efforts from Comber, with Wilson coming close before his team-mate Tumilson was denied dramatically in injury time.This signied the last piece of action as the referee brought his whistle to his lips to the relief of the Kilmore support.Following the conclusion goal scorer and man of the match, Niall McCarthy, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos impressive victory.ldquoIt was a battle, the pitch was very heavy and I think it just came down to who wanted it more, he said.ldquoWe knew with Comber coming down here that they are a very physical, very fit team, who are well-drilled.ldquoHowever, we firmly believe in our camp that we are the best team in the league. We work hard every Tuesday and Thursday night and itrsquos a credit to our manager, Michael Carvill, for the shape hersquos pulled us in to.Kilmore: C Turley, J McCarthy, M Stewart, J Larkin, G Kennedy, B Walsh, J Smyth, N McCarthy , J McKinney, A McGrattan, E McGrattan.Subs: C Magee, M Monan, M Carvill.Yellow cards: C Magee, A McGrattan, J McKinney.Comber: A Topping, M Gibson, L Walker, B Porter, R Whittle, S Moore, B Nelson, S Hanna , D Wilson, M Tumilson, G Keenan.Subs: S Fleck, C Gillan, K Gaw.Yellow cards: S Moore, C Gillan, B Porter, S Hanna..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Knockevin in £75k funding initiative  ","story":"KNOCKEVIN Special Schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association has unveiled details of an ambitious pound, fundraising initiative.The school has bases in Downpatrick, Dundrum and Castlewellan, with the parent and staff group hoping that the ldquoenchantment project will raise vital funds to purchase essential outdoor play and learning equipment.In addition, some of the pound, will be used to meet school bus running costs and other essential items at Knockevinrsquos three bases.Announcing details of the new fundraising initiative, the parent and staff group said pupils are in need of ious items to help combat social deprivation as a result of the ongoing pandemic.ldquoOur children may not always have the same opportunity for social inclusion as those in mainstream education, but to be able to provide them with an outdoor space they can safely and comfortably enjoy together which is fully accessible and tailored to all their needs would be a dream come true, said a spokesperson for the group.ldquoOur children and young adults are most deserving of this. and, as with all specialist equipment, a large price tag is included and we aim to hold as many fundraising activities and events as possible to ensure that we reach our goal.As Covid restrictions continue to ease, the highly acclaimed special school will be able to hold its th anniversary at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel on September , with entertainment provided by the Booze Bros and Finbarr Keaveney the compere for the evening.ldquoWe are looking forward to getting together again to celebrate all that has been achieved in the past  years.

However, by pm the taped route was ready, the registration was complete and the nervous but excited youngsters were warming up in anticipation.Primary Four and under lined up, first the boys and then the girls. With vests down to their knees and a few anxious glances to parents, it seemed that they were almost too young for such a task but once the whistle blew they set off like rockets round the m circuit.Harry McVeigh, for Newcastle AC, was the clear winner in the boysrsquo race and Aoe Maguireheld a five second lead to win the girlsrsquo race.Primary Five saw the girls and boys combined in the one race and the winners were John McElroyand Emily Kerr . The  metres didnrsquot seem a bother to either of these young athletes.Ryan Thorntonwent off hard for the P win and Saorlaith McAleenanwas the epitome of focus as she headed to the line to come first in the P girls.With  entrants and the distance now one kilometre, it was a challenging race.The P looked an experienced bunch as they gathered at the start.Many have been racing each other in the Flahavanrsquos XC Series for schools so there were scores to be settled. Maisie McVeighwas taking no chances and after a short tussle, she shrugged off the rest of the field and ran solo to take the P girlsrsquo victory.Fiachna McAleenanalso showed his mettle leading home the P boys. This was raced over m.It was great to see the support for the younger ones, not just from parents but from older siblings and club mates, who ran along side each race yelling at the younger ones to encourage them to work hard right to the finish line.On more than one occasion there were groups breaching the line as an inseparable unit and joint times had to be awarded. This was exciting for spectators and a learning experience for the runners.In time they will develop the ability to pace over the course to keep their position but leave a little in the tank for a sprint finishrequired.The series is about participation as well as competition and all runners get a point for their club provided they finish the race.This helps to engender club spirit and creates a charged atmosphere.The post primary runners were well warmed up from their cheerleading efforts on the sideline so they were primed for racing when it was eventually their turn.In Years Eight, Nine and Ten, the girls outnumbered the boys in each category but by Year  plus, it was the reverse.Still, it was good to see healthy numbers out to take part overall in the post primary end of things. The distance for year eight was m and Erin Easton , who won the girlsrsquo race by eight seconds, looked controlled throughout. Aaron OrsquoBoylehad an exciting sprint to the line to snatch glory in Year Eight boys.Emma Stewartcovered the m Year Nine girlsrsquo race at great speed to place first girl and Alex Robinson seemed to revel in the extra running as the gap between him and the second runner stretched out as the race proceeded.Year Ten boys and girls ran together as there were  when combined.The m race allowed spectators to get multiple glimpses as the they looped round the field.Aaron Lennonwon his race comfortably and Edana Butterfieldhad a similar outcome in the girlsrsquo category.The finale was Year  and up. This had a mix of gender as well as year groups.

Finnerty eventually notched the next score for his Galway outfit, before the goal scorer, Conroy, would kick over from distance ndash albeit with some wind assistance.The hosts seemed to fighting an uphill battle as the wind battered around Pairc Esler in favour of the visiting side, with Conroy once again managing to point from long range.This opened up a five point winning margin with the Mourne men desperately needing scores on the board.However, the weather could not be at fault for all of their shortcomings as they struggled with the impressive Galway forward line.Walsh was once again involved when he surged past the Down defence before setting up team-mate Owen Gallagher for an easy score.Cormac McCartan attempted to get the home side back into the contest with what seemed like an easy kick over from  metres, although the wind made sure the ball hung in the air before ping comfortably into the hands of Galway lsquokeeper Conor Flaherty.Downrsquos Andrew Gilmore did convert his point three minutes later but as per the theme of the match, Galway replied quickly through Tomo Culhane, who took the mark and scored at the other end.Galway introduced the ing Damien Comer to the fray and with his first touch of the ball he also took the mark and made no mistake with his chance to secure another point for the visitors.Walsh was relishing the blustery conditions and was firing from will at all angles, with one such effort sailing over the black spot from around  metres before the half-time whistle.This signied the last score of a half that contained very few positives for McCartanrsquos side.Half-time: Down - Galway -.The Mourne men registered the opening score of the second half, courtesy of a Barry OrsquoHagan free.Two minutes later, home supporters were perhaps left a little surprised when a goal opportunity presented itself but Cormac McCartan opted instead to play it safe and fire over the bar.Nevertheless, Down had scored two points answered and soon OrsquoHagan would ensure a third after he took the mark and converted the chance.OrsquoHagan continued his impressive start to the second half when he kicked over once again following a turnover in possession.It was now Galway who was struggling with the wind, with Kieran Molloy witnessing his straightforward point from  metres halted by the breeze.Passionate ranting from Down manager, James McCartan, saw him pick up a yellow after exchanging words with the fourth official but there was no denying his side at their tails up.A wide mark from Galwayrsquos Paul Kelly encouraged the hosts further but Gallagher eventually notched his sidersquos first point after the interval following twenty minutes of action.Despite all of Downrsquos hard work, the scoreboard still favoured the visitors by five points in what was a sobering reminder of the home outfitrsquos poor first half display.It didnrsquot help the hosts when Comer notched the next score before Walsh followed suit with a trio of converted frees.Galway attempted to inflict further damage at the death as Tony Gill barrelled down on goal, although he was dragged down before he could unleash his shot.Continuing his impressive kicking form from frees, Walsh once again converted to complete his sidersquos scoring.However, it would be Downrsquos Gilmore who would register the final score of the contest with the last kick of the game, as he curled his left-footed effort over the bar in added time.Following the final whistle, Down manager James McCartan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe are disappointed, the game was closer than the six point margin but we lost it in the first half, he said.ldquoWe let Galway play and we werenrsquot putting bodies on the line.

In the opening  minutes a number of early misdemeanours from the travelling team in the tackle, at the breakdown and at scrum led to Friends dominating territory and possession as the game got up and running.Within this period the home team gathered up an eight-point lead through a well struck penalty following a Down High tackle and a quick tapped free kick on the Down five metre line after the front row had been judged to have pushed early in a scrum, which led to a try for the hosts. As the game moved into its middle stages, Down began to find their way back into the game with some eye catching counter attacks from their back three.Meanwhile half backs, George Thompson at scrum half and Ben Cassidy at out half, kicked well at key moments in spite of the wind, to capitalise on space left by Friends in their back field.Just before half time it was following one of these kicks that Down earned a penalty on the Friends ten metre line.Cassidy kicked to the corner and off the resulting line out Down mauled close to Friends line before Ryan Halpin saw an opportunity to barge over the whitewash for a well worked try.Cassidy then reduced arrears to one point with an accurate conversion.Down entered the second half confident with the strong wind now very much in their favour.Things didnrsquot always go their way with some periods when the green defence was severely tested.However, around ten minutes into the half Halpin found himself back on the scoresheet to give Down High the lead for the first time as he strode clear of the covering defence off a well-timed pass from rumbling front row forward, Mark Jackson. Cassidy added the two points to give Down a six-point margin in their favour.With ten minutes to go, Halpin played a key role Downrsquos crucial third try. Captain, Brett Kelly who had an excellent day both in attack and defence, laid the foundations for this score executing a pre-planned set piece play.Following this, George Thompson spotted an overlap on the blindside with Halpin ending up on the ball in a two versus one scenario with full back Alex Watson outside him space.The pass was timed superbly and Watson ed over in the corner for an unconverted try to take the score to -.To their credit, the home side didnrsquot accept that Downrsquos  point lead was a done deal and for the closing ten minutes, applied plenty of pressure.Indeed Friends crossed the line with one minute remaining on the clock for an unconverted try leaving a nervy finish for Down High as they sought to protect their six point lead.The restart offered some territorial respite and all in the travelling squad and those supporting them leapt high with joy when a Friends knock-on gave the referee the cue to blow the final whistle with time well past the  minute mark.Down High now face Sullivan Upper at home in the semi-finals on Saturday, February . In other games at home last week, Down High third XV bowed out of their plate competition at the quarter-final stage with a narrow - loss to Campbell College fourth XV in what was an entertaining fixture, while a select U-  team defeated Wellington College -.The other plaudits of the weekend went to the U- A team, who produced a captivating performance to defeat RBAI - on Saturday morning.The U- B and Cs, also playing RBAI, lost but put in some proud performances demonstrating the impressive depth in this squad..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13376771.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Many of the myths that were established over the five or six years since the referendum have been repeated.By Owen PolleySaturday, th February , : am  \"       \"  An anti-Brexit mock-up of Theresa May steering the good ship Brexit into an iceberg outside the Palace of Westminster Owen Polley argues that many people have misunderstood the reality of Mrs May’s Brexit dealLet’s look at some of the most popular and persistent.First, many people claimed again that an Irish Sea border became inevitable when the UK decided to leave the EU. They said that the protocol is the fault of Brexit supporters, including unionistswho voted for it. Pro-Union leavers should therefore ‘own’ the consequences of their decision and stop complaining.One problem with this logic is that the Republic’s government, under the then-taoiseach Enda Kenny, did not think that a sea border was inevitable in the months following the referendum.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It is the fact that this did not happen that is extraordinary and unprecedented.More importantly, from a political and moral perspective, unionists had every right to campaign for Brexit, without fear that Northern Ireland would subsequently be wrenched out of important aspects of the Union. Their place in the United Kingdom relies on the ‘principle of consent’, which is supposed to be a central tenet of the Belfast Agreement. Andthat principle means anything at all, voters in Northern Ireland would expect to take part in a nationwide referendum and have its outcome applied here on the same terms as voters where in the UK. You can understand why nationalist parties, that have never convincingly accepted that the principle of consent has consequences, would not grasp this argument. It is more disturbing when some self-declared unionists seem to share their outlook.During the EU referendum, pro-Union people took part in both the ‘remain’ and ‘leave’ campaigns. Afterwards, perfectly reasonably, they took dferent views about what kind of Brexit the UK should pursue.The one point of consensus should have been that any outcome must be UK wide and include Northern Ireland fully.Another piece of received wisdom, repeated constantly, is that the DUP insisted on a ‘hard Brexit’ and rejected every proposal that would have resulted in a ‘softer’ outcome.This is connected to the even more inaccurate claim that Theresa May’s ‘backstop’ deal would have prevented economic barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Admittedly, the DUP’s performance, in the wake of , has been distinctly unimpressive. It spurned the chance to play a constructive role in the UK government after the  election, preferring to boast that it had secured £ billion in funding. It endorsed the ‘joint report’ of December  that entrenched Theresa May’s ‘backstop’, after initially insisting on ineffective changes.And it eventually agreed to a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, before Boris Johnson signed his protocol.However, despite the impression given by MPs like Ian Paisley and Sammy Wilson, the DUP did not insist on a ‘hard Brexit’. The party’s only ‘red line’ was that any deal should treat Northern Ireland the same as the rest of the UK.Its Westminster leader at the time, Nigel Dodds, told the BBC’s Newsnight programme that, given a choice between protecting the Union and delivering Brexit, the DUP would choose the Union.The party rejected Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement because it treated Northern Ireland dferently. Yes, the former prime minister’s aim was to keep the whole UK tied closely to the EU’s single market and customs union which, in the short term, may have prevented disruption to GB-NI trade.But the whole point of the ‘backstop’ was thatthe rest of the UK erged from Brussels’ rules, Northern Ireland would remain tied to the single market and customs union. May was committed to a close relationship with the EU, but her government was hanging by a thread.Her agreement was likely to create every problem subsequently entrenched by the Protocol, as soon as a more eurosceptic administration took power in Westminster.In addition, it removed Northern Ireland officially from the UK’s customs regime and tied it to the EU set-up instead. For the casual observer, a lot of this detail was easy to miss. Consistently, the Westminster government played down problems involved in the withdrawal agreements championed first by Theresa May and then by Boris Johnson. It’s understandable that the DUP’s opponents, and particularly its unionist rivals, want to point out the party’s failures.On the pro-Union side, though, they should be careful to ensure that their criticisms are well-aimed and accurate.There is every danger that, otherwise, they might end up strengthening profoundly anti-unionist arguments and bolstering the position of those who are using Brexit as an excuse to weaken the Union.– Ben Lowry s next weekMore from the News Letter: WATCH – Bid to intimidate ‘orange scum’ out of mixed housing estate fails Click here – RUC ‘collusive’ findings: WATCH as DUP man denounces IRA while speaker Alex Maskey tries to rein him in for ‘going off-topic’——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityBut, while the overall picture in regards to the potentially deadly virus is improving, a senior Welsh Government minister has issued a stark reminder that the virus remains at large in the community.Speaking at a government press conference instead of first minister Mark Drakeford – who is himself isolating having tested positive for covid - economy minister Vaughan Gething provided the nation with the latest rule changes.However, while he confirmed that the main omicron wave has passed, he also revealed that a sub iant of omicron, the BA. omicron iant, has been found in Wales.The minister revealed that as of today - Friday, February  -  cases of this iant, which is said to be an even more transmissible form of omicron, have been identied across Wales.And it is this particular sub iant which is thought to be the primary reason why Northern Ireland is currently seeing a much higher percentage of positive covid cases relative to its population size, than the other UK nations.Fortunately, while more transmissible, it is thought that omicron is a less severe strain of covid than previous waves, and as such, Wales is continuing with plans to scrap many restrictions which are currently in place – albeit not as drastically as England are slashing their measures at this time.What was said about the sub iant Mr Gething said: “Cases of this even more transmissible form of omicron have been identied in all parts of the UK, and to date, there have been  cases here in Wales.“We will of course continue to keep a very close eye on this emerging development.“The pandemic pressures on our hospitals remain constant.“There are just under , covid- related patients in hospitalat the moment.“And there are  people with covid- in intensive care.“Sickness and absence rates across the NHS have fallen from the peak last month but, workforce issues continue to have an impact on our health services, contributing to wider winter pressures.”.removeWhat are the latest rule changes coming into force From Friday, February , Covid passes will no longer be required to enter venues such as nightclubs, theatres and concert halls  in Wales – although inidual venues and events can continue to ask for themthey wish.What’s more, while face coverings will still be required for now, they will no longer be mandatory in indoor public places – apart from retail, public transport and health and care settings - from Monday, February .From there,the public health conditions continue to improve, the legal requirement to wear face coverings in all remaining settings could be lted by the end of March. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCardf International Business Park would be built on farmland east of Cardf Airport in the Vale of Glamorgan.But the plans have attracted heavy criticism from campaigners and politicians fearing the impact on the environment of “concreting over” a working farm.Now Legal and General, the developer behind the scheme, has said the business park would create , jobs and attract £ million investment, boosting the local economy.Andrew McPhillips, Legal and General’s development director of strategic land and major projects, said: “This is a key project for Wales and we know it is important that we continue to communicate our plans to key stakeholders, the community and future partners.“Wales must be open for business for those who want to invest and consider investment in its future global economic development. The land has been allocated for planning within the enterprise zone for a number of years.”As well as building the -hectare business park, the plans involve giving  hectares of farmland to Vale of Glamorgan council, to massively extend the neighbouring Porthkerry Country Park. A corridor of land along Porthkerry Road would also be kept safeguarded, connecting the nearby railway line with Cardf Airport for a potential new train or tram service there.Mr McPhillips said: “We have already agreed the transfer of  hectares of land to the Vale of Glamorgan Council to form an extension to Porthkerry Country Park, for use by the community with added funding for environmental management.“This transfer will provide more public access with connection to the Wales Coastal Path, and access on foot from Porthkerry and Rhoose. From an environmental perspective, this transfer goes beyond mitigation and provides signicant bioersity net gain. There would also be . hectares of green space within the business park.”.removeThe business park would be built on Model Farm, off Port Road, which has been farmed by the Jenkins family for four generations. The family previously said they were “devastated” that they would have to leave the farm, but are hoping to continue their wildflower seed business.Legal and General bought the farm several years ago, and it was earmarked for a major building project in , as part of Vale of Glamorgan council’s local development plan. The site is also in one of eight enterprise zones in Wales, where the Welsh Government is focusing economic development and encouraging businesses to invest.Last summer the Vale council’s planning committee voted to grant permission for the business park at Model Farm. Campaigners then successfully applied for a judicial review, leading to the permission getting quashed. Now, another planning application has been sent to the council, and a public consultation on the plans is running until February .Then in the next few months, councillors on the planning committee will again be asked to vote on whether to approve permission for the business park. The last vote was split along party lines, with nine councillors voting in favour and eight against. With the upcoming local election in May, the political makeup of the committee could change, affecting the next vote.But in the meantime, Legal and General has released new estimates of how Cardf International Business Park could boost the local economy. With overall floorspace of the development covering , square metres, it’s expected the business park could provide space for , full-time employees.Gross value added, which measures local economic output, is expected to be a total of £ million, comprising £ million when the business park is operational and £ million during construction. Building the business park is expected to last a decade, creating  jobs.However, Maxine Levett, a campaigner with Vale Communities Unite, said several questions regarding the plans remain unanswered. She added the business park would be “detrimental” to the community and environment, and was unnecessary with several vacant brownfield sites nearby.She said: “This is a working farm helping feed the community and encouraging bioersity, when the Vale council has declared a climate emergency. The current land available at the Bro St Athans site shows there isn’t a requirement for this type of development, as there are thousands of square metres of brownfield sites waiting to be scooped up.“Who will finance the road works to accommodate the impact of potentially , extra vehicles from this site, on top of additional transport needs from recent residential buildings and the proposed development of Aberthaw power station “Bristol Airport has declared they are increasing their passengers to  million a year. This will greatly impact companies willing to fly out of Cardf Airport. And where is the funding coming from to provide a rail link to a planned transport hub “We will continue to fight this development as we feel it to be detrimental to the community, environment and unnecessary with Aberthaw, St Athan and other locations near to the M corridor better placed to meet employment needs, rather than a working farm.”Contrary to the views of campaigners and some local politicians, Legal and General has claimed it would preserve and enhance the environment. Plans include three kilometres of new hedgerows, and planting five acres of scrub and woodland, as well as extending Porthkerry Country Park.Mr McPhillips said: “Legal and General has been committed to Wales as a progressive investor and substantial employer for many years. This is a project which will increase economic growth and we will continue to pursue the planning viability sensitively with existing stakeholders.“Creating , jobs and investment of £ million must be seen as essential for the future of the Welsh economy, especially next to Cardf Airport. This investment in business infrastructure by Legal and General enhances the Welsh Government’s current major investment in Cardf Airport, a strategic gateway to facilitate international connectivity.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityBoris Johnson surprised experts on Wednesday when he announced during Prime Minister’s Questions that all Covid restrictions could end this month, including a requirement for those who test positive to quarantine for five days.The Welsh Government has said it is not considering removing the regulation until at least the end of March.David TC Davies, MP for Monmouth in south-east Wales, has said he backs the Tory party leader’s plans and refuted claims by Wales’ economy minister Vaughan Gething that the decision was not based on scientic evidence.Mr Davies, the under-secretary of state for Wales, said erging policies on self-isolation would cause issues – particularly for people who travel regularly across both nations to live and work.He told the PA news agency: “The UK Government have always acted on scientic evidence, and have always been committed to ing people’s liberties as quickly as possible, whereas the Welsh Government seems to want to keep restrictions on freedom in place for as long as possible.“And that highlights the dference between a Welsh Labour and a Conservative UK government.” vw,vw,px, px\"Welsh economy minister Vaughan Gething has said Boris Johnson’s plans to end all Covid regulations early are not based on scientic evidence “Once again the Welsh Government have decided to do things dferently, seemingly for the sake of making a statement, that they’re the Welsh Government and they can do things dferently,” he said.“This is just going to cause confusion and inconvenience for people living in Wales,” he added.“People have expressed concerns all the way through about the fact that the Welsh Government have decided to quite often adopt dferent rules, so I’ve no doubt that it will be an issue.”.removeDuring a press conference on Friday to announce the three-week review of the rules in Wales, Mr Gething said he did not think dfering policies would cause confusion.He told journalists: “I think people have got used to the fact there has occasionally been dferences between the two countries. It’s very clear though, the rules of Wales apply when you’re in Wales.”The minister criticised the Prime Minister for “ambushing” the devolved governments and even his own Cabinet members with the decision about scrapping self-isolation rules, and suggested such moves were a barrier to a closer working relationship between the two governments.Responding to the claims, Mr Davies said: “The Welsh Government have been present at Cobra meetings where a lot of the decisions have been taken, so they know exactly how we’ve arrived at the decisions.“They have not allowed the UK Government equal access to meetings at which they take decisions. So we never have a clue what they’re about to do.“We should be working more closely together and it’s an absolute crying shame that we can’t, and that instead of working closely, they’re determined to take every opportunity to attack the UK Government and drive a wedge between the UK Government and Wales.”On the same day as PMQs, the House of Commons Welsh Affairs Committee heard evidence from experts about intergovernmental relations, including Philip Rycroft CB, former permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union, who said the Covid- pandemic had been a “huge missed opportunity”.Mr Rycroft, also the former head of the UK Governance Group at the Cabinet Office, said: “I think it all began to fracture in about May , when the Prime Minister was on the TV making announcements about changes to the rules and regulations without it being clear whether he was speaking about England or the whole of the UK. That is the moment this began to crumble.“As I said, that was a huge missed opportunity, and when the history books are written about this, I think it will be seen as such.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Tory MP condemns Welsh Government over plans to keep self-isolation rules article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
