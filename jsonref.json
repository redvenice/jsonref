If you get the injection, your arm may be sore, too, or you might experience a slight fever or aching muscles for a day or two afterwards. Serious side effects with both the jab and nasal spray are extremely rare.HOW WILL MY CHILD BE VACCINATED AGAINST FLU?Most children will be vaccinated at school, but those who have not started yet, or who are in a high-risk group, can also get it from their GP.I\u0027M PREGNANT – IS IT SAFE TO GET THE COVID AND FLU JABS?Yes – both are safe for pregnant women, and it\u0027s important to have both if eligible. There are more risks for you and your pregnancy if you contract Covid-19 without the vaccine, and the flu vaccine will also help protect your unborn baby.If you catch flu when pregnant, you\u0027re at risk from complications such as bronchitis and it could cause your baby to be born prematurely, have a low birth weight and may even lead to stillbirth.If you are pregnant, you can get a free flu vaccine from your GP, pharmacist or through your maternity service.  ◼ To check your eligibility for the flu vaccine and Covid-19 booster vaccine or to find a service, visit nhs.ukwintervaccinations ■ This article is part of a paid-for partnership with the UK Government"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/11/10/01/50284077-0-image-a-30_1636507651866.jpg","title":"Israels ambassador UK evacuated LSE security guards","story":"Share this article Ms Hotovely was a controversial choice as Israel\u0027s Ambassador to the UK, having been appointed by former PM Benjamin Netanyahu and a member of his Likud party.She took up the role in London last year - provoking uproar among left-wing British Jews after serving as settlements minister back home.Foreign Minister Yair Lapid tried to oust her from the position when Mr Netanyahu fell earlier this year, but she refused due to her three-year contract.A petition was set up last year to ban her from becoming ambassador, which read: \u0027Hotovely has an appalling record of racist and inflammatory behavior from throughout her political career.\u0027As British Jews we are clear: Tzipi Hotovely\u0027s values and politics have no place in the UK.

A later contractual row cost the taxpayer another £185million.In August it was estimated that more than a quarter of UK Border Force staff at Heathrow were away from work after being in close contact with someone who tested positive for Covid.

Hundreds of millions of people in Africa without access to electricity or clean cooking fuel should “use gas as the core source of energy”. “We believe sincerely that natural gas does offer the balanced solution that the world seeks to achieve sustainable development goals,” he concluded. The problem is not many agree these days that gas should be a bridge fuel between coal and renewables. That’s because burning gas still produces a lot of CO2, time is very short to halt the climate emergency and renewables are getting ever cheaper.  Last week, a report from Climate Analytics (the team behind the alarming 2.4C projection that made headlines yesterday) dismissed the arguments for gas. “Gas is not a bridging fuel, blue hydrogen is not a bridging technology, ultimately, gas is a bridge to nowhere.

Video: ReutersFormer US president Barack Obama and US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry arrive at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. Photograph: Jane BarlowPA WireThe world “has to step up, and it has to step up now” in response to climate change, former US president Barrack Obama has said in an address to the UN Cop26 summit in Glasgow.As the gathering faces into its final days of hard negotiation on a deal to limit the extent of global heating, Mr Obama said the climate crisis was the one thing that must transcend day-to-day politics and geopolitics.“What is also true, collectively and inidually we are still falling short. We have not done nearly enough to address this crisis, we will need to do more,” Mr Obama said in a speech to a plenary gathering.He declared “the US is back” at the forefront of global climate action after “stalling” during the Trump years, and went on to criticise Chinese president Xi Jinping and Russian president Vladimir Putin for not joining other leaders at the summit. He said he believed this suggested “a dangerous lack of urgency”.At a closed meeting of members of the “high ambition coalition” (HAC) – which includes Ireland – Mr Obama is understood to have firmly supported developing countries pushing for a climate deal limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees.In his speech earlier, Mr Obama acknowledged progress already made by negotiators in Glasgow but warned that gaps needed to be bridged in coming days.‘More at stake’The biggest force for facing up to the scale of action needed was among young people, he said. “The reason is simple – they have more at stake in this fight than anyone else... If those older people won’t listen, they need to get out the way.”Addressing HAC ministers including Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan, Mr Obama said: “What you are doing – what the HAC is attempting to accomplish – is vital.”Noting the coalition’s role in 2015 in ensuring the 1.5 degree target was written into the Paris agreement, he added: “The brutal tempests of the warming climate are making even clearer that we cross that line at our peril. Once again… it falls on the HAC to make that case.”“You’ve come together once again to speak to not only the need to get to 1.5 degrees, but also to provide the adaptation funding that’s necessary for those who may end up paying the steepest price for actions that they themselves did not take.”A draft statement from the HAC circulated on Monday notes “deep concern” over the gap between existing commitments on emissions made at Cop26 and far deeper cuts needed to limit global heating to within 1.5 degrees, “in this decisive decade”. Not all countries in the coalition have signed the statement, but 40 current signatories include groups of developing countries: the Alliance of Small Island States, the Least Developed Countries and the African Group.‘Diplomatic bullying’Bolivia’s chief negotiator Diego Pacheco Balanza has criticised a refusal by richer countries to discuss loss and damage or compensation at Cop26 as evidence of “diplomatic bullying”.“There’s been a systematic attempt by developed countries to remove all discussion about responsibility, compensation and direct climate finance from the negotiations, it’s shameful,” he said.“Instead, they want us to focus on carbon markets and their 2050 net zero narrative, which is completely meaningless. The net zero narrative is a big lie. We need to eliminate greenhouse gases now, not in 30 years.”The first draft of the “Glasgow decision text” published on Monday, which contains no mention of phasing out fossil fuels, was described as exceptionally weak by Jennifer Morgan, director of Greenpeace International.“Usually the text starts with some ambition, which then gets watered down,” she said. “To keep 1.5 alive, four words must be added: ‘fossil fuels phase out’, and countries must come back next year to close the gap.”"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Of some 240 known wetland species, almost 70 have been listed for Red List protectionStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 eamon ryan calls for rulebook on emissions commitments","story":"US climate envoy John Kerry warned that if emissions were not reduced enough by 2030, achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 would be impossible. Photograph: Christopher FurlongGetty ImagesThe Cop26 summit will generate significant momentum for climate actions across the globe if a detailed and precise rulebook on implementing the landmark Paris agreement emerges from Glasgow this week, Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan has said. Mr Ryan said that even if only a majority of countries supported a rulebook reinforced by “the same rules, the same reporting, and the same timelines”, it would “build momentum for the decisions you need to take in business, in transport and elsewhere”.The Green Party leader, who is heading the Irish delegation at the conference, took part in the Adaptation Fund Contributor Dialogue, an initiative aimed at scaling up funding to help countries vulnerable to climate change to adapt to its impacts. Ireland is to contribute at least €10 million by the end of next year in the form of grants for developing countries, he said.Adaptation challengeAddressing the adaptation challenge would require an unprecedented level of international co-operation, Mr Ryan said. “I believe it can be done and Ireland is determined to play its part, during the final days of Cop26 this week but also through our efforts at home.”Speaking at the same event, US climate envoy John Kerry said the coming week “can define the decade” in terms of global climate action, warning that if emissions were not reduced enough by 2030, achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 would be impossible. “The stakes here could not be higher,” he added. Mr Ryan told a press briefing that Cop26 would achieve a good outcome if the rulebook is “absolutely precise” on timelines for reviews and how governments report on their “national determined contributions” for reducing emissions. On reducing methane, he agreed it was the fastest and most effective way to cut emissions. While an international pact, backed by the Government, aiming to reduce global methane levels by 30 per cent by 2030 was not a national target, he believed Ireland would be “centrally involved in addressing methane arising from agriculture and land use”.OffsettingOn a push for carbon markets with options for big business to offset emissions in developing countries, he said he would be nervous about that given the chequered history of offsetting.Ireland has joined the National Adaptation Plan Global Network and committed €1 million to help developing countries build national adaptation plans and become climate-resilient. Minister of State for Overseas Development Aid Colm Brophy announced the funding, which will support small island developing states and the least-developed countries “to strengthen transparency, accountability and inclusion in climate action with a focus on tracking progress on adaptation”. He added: “Adaptation prioritises the needs of those communities most exposed to, and already living with, the impacts of climate change. As such, it is a core priority of Ireland’s international climate action. We are delighted to support the network and look forward to working with likeminded countries in delivering real impact through this group.”Mr Brophy said he hoped to see the commitment to provide $100 billion a year for developing countries as soon as possible underpinned by progress this week towards the target. Commenting on Cop26, he said: “I think there has been a sea change. It’s the first Cop where there is a real meaningful understanding and work with climate finance and adaptation at the heart of it... I hope that will build up trust.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland s access to single market may be jeopardised says taoiseach","story":"British Brexit minister David Frost, speaking in the House of Lords, has said that no government has a greater interest in stability and security in Northern Ireland than the UK government. Video: ReutersTaoiseach Micheál Martin: ‘My views are very strong and I don’t think there’s a need to trigger Article 16. I believe it would be wrong to do so.’ Photograph: Alan Betson  The Taoiseach Micheál Martin has warned that Northern Ireland’s access to the single market could be “jeopardised” if Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol is triggered.His comments come as fears grow in Dublin and Brussels of an imminent British move to suspend parts of the agreement.However, Mr Martin cautioned against an assumption that the British government will move to invoke the article.Mr Martin told the Dáil on Wednesday that he wanted to “sign a note of caution that we don’t automatically assume that anything is going to be triggered”.He said “I think that’s important that we don’t talk about the self-fulfilling prophecy either. My views are very strong and I don’t think there’s a need to trigger Article 16. I believe it would be wrong to do so.”The Taoiseach said access to the single market was important to people and businesses in the North but he warned that any triggering of Article 16 “would ultimately jeopardise in the short-term that access”.He told TDs during Taoiseach’s questions that “what’s important now is that we double down on dialogue and engagement. And that’s what is happening.”Mr Martin reiterated his view last week that it would be “reckless and irresponsible” for the British government to trigger Article 16.He said European Commissioner Marius Sefcovic had come forward with a package of proposals that were quite far reaching and a “very comprehensive seat of measures” which formed the basis for further set of negotiations with the UK government.But it was “very regrettable that in advance of the publication of the measures Lord Frost announced the issue around the ECJ (European Court of Justice)”.“We formed a view that it was maybe an effort to almost torpedo the Sefcovic package before it was published. But I don’t think it had that impact in any event”.The package was “strong and substantive”, dealing with all the legitimate issues that people raised.Separately, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has warned British prime minister Boris Johnson,the UK will not end up with a better deal if it triggers article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol.“The message I’d send to Boris Johnson is that we have an agreement in relation to Northern Ireland, we have an agreement in relation to trade with the European Union – don’t jeopardise it,” Mr Varadkar said in Dublin on Wednesday morning.“You were part of negotiating it, you own it, it was hard won, it’s a mistake to think that by escalating tensions or by trying to withdraw from any part of it, that you’ll end up with a better deal: you won’t.”Mr Varadkar’s comments come amid growing tension between the UK and European Union over London’s stated intention to trigger the break clause in the protocol unless the EU concedes further on key issues. He said the EU could retaliate against the UK, potentially endangering the entire trade deal and revising the prospect of a no-deal Brexit.“We have a protocol in place that is largely working, has prevented a hard border between north and south, and we have a trade agreement in place with Britain which allows us to trade with Britain without tariffs and that’s really important to Irish business,” he said at an event at the Guinness Enterprise Centre.“And if the British government decides to trigger article 16, while that doesn’t mean withdrawing from the protocol, it does potentially retaliatory action from the European Union, which could mean suspending parts of the trade agreement. We’d have to give a year’s notice to do that, but that then does create uncertainty for business.”Such a move would change the “certainty” that businesses in both jurisdictions had enjoyed, Mr Varadkar said. “And I think that would be a big mistake.“The uncertainty that was created by Brexit went on for years, I think it would be a big mistake for the British government to reopen that uncertainty. I’d hate us to be talking again about a no-deal Brexit or a cliff edge or any of those terms that we’d forgotten or almost stopped using.”“Any attempt to trigger article 16 would be bad news for businesses in Northern Ireland, here in Ireland and indeed in Britain,” he said.‘Stay calm’Meanwhile, Britain’s Brexit minister Lord Frost has said Brussels should “stay calm and keep things in proportion”.He claimed in the House of Lords on Wednesday afternoon that triggering article 16 — which would effectively suspend elements of the arrangements — would be the UK’s only option if the dispute was not resolved.Lord Frost told the Lords there was “a real opportunity to turn away from confrontation, to move beyond our current difficulties and put in place a new, and better, equilibrium” in the talks.And he said it was “not inevitable” that article 16 is triggered. He said: “In my view, this talks process has not reached its end.“Although we have been talking nearly four weeks now, there remain possibilities that the talks have not yet seriously examined, including many approaches suggested by the UK.“There is more to do and I will certainly not give up on this process unless and until it is abundantly clear that nothing more can be done. We are certainly not there yet.“If, however, we do in due course reach that point, the article 16 safeguards will be our only option.”He added: “I can reassure the House that if article 16 were to be used, we would of course set out our case with confidence and explain that case to any interested party.”The UK government has set the EU a December deadline to find a solution on the Northern Ireland protocol, which was agreed as a way to maintain a free-flowing land border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.The arrangement effectively keeps Northern Ireland inside the EU’s single market for goods, resulting in some checks for products crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain.But Mr Johnson and Lord Frost have claimed the EU’s interpretation of the deal has led to difficulties. He said: “I gently suggest that our European friends should stay calm and keep things in proportion.“They might remind themselves that no government and no country has a greater interest in stability and security in Northern Ireland, in the Belfast Agreement, than we do.“We are hardly likely to proceed in a way that puts all that at risk. “If the EU were to choose to react in a disproportionate way, and decide to aggravate the problems in Northern Ireland rather than reduce them, that is, of course, a matter for them.“At that point we would be entitled to come to our own judgment about how much value we could attach to their commitment to supporting the peace process and the people of Northern Ireland as against protecting their own interests.”‘Aggressive move’Earlier, former British secretary of state for Northern Ireland Peter Hain has said the UK’s suspension of parts of the Northern Ireland Brexit deal would be a “very aggressive and bombastic move”.Irish and British parliamentarians attending a virtual meeting of Oireachtas committees expressed grave concern about the British government’s threat to trigger article 16.Lord Hain, a Labour Party peer, said he feared the move by UK government “has been coming for a long time” and saw it as a confrontation with Brussels, not aimed at solving a problem but “designed to appeal to the Conservative Party’s Brexit base”.This would amount to a “total and radical departure from the close relationship of trust that was painstakingly built over decades between Dublin and London”, Lord Hain told the Oireachtas committees on EU affairs, Brexit and the Belfast Agreement.Given the “tangled history” between the two countries, any attempt “to destroy that trust is very, very serious”, said the British politician, who served as British secretary of state for Northern Ireland between 2005 and 2007.Lord Hain was speaking as a member of the House of Lords European affairs sub-committee on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.The protocolThe protocol is the special Brexit deal agreed between the UK and the EU to prevent a hard border re-emerging on the island of Ireland.The arrangement keeps Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU but creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and Britain.Unionists argue that the protocol undermines Northern Ireland’s place in the UK. The British government objects to the European Court of Justice being the final court of appeal.Lord Hain told the meeting of Irish and British parliamentarians he believed the UK government’s objections were “about political identity rather than trade”.Liberal Democrat peer Lord Thomas said the “machinery was there” to create a new court within the European Court of Justice structure that could be manned by three or four judges from the EU and three or four judges from the UK with an independent president sitting above them holding the balance.Baroness Nuala O’Loan, the former Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland, said “the people of Northern Ireland really are not complaining about the protocol”.“They are finding ways to make it work,” she said.Labour TD Brendan Howlin said the threat to trigger article 16 was “baffling” and would leave Irish-British relations built over 20 years “fundamentally fractured”. – Additional reporting PA How is Brexit affecting you?

Photograph: Daniel McLaughlinRussian president Vladimir Putin is not attending the UN climate talks in Glasgow, and declined to commit the world’s fourth-biggest polluter to pacts agreed there to cut the use of coal and emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.Russia has instead put much of its focus at Cop26 on the need to save trees, and joined more than 100 other states in pledging to stop deforestation by 2030.The promise may surprise ecologists who say thousands of hectares of forest and other important wildlife habitat were destroyed by massive building work ordered by Putin before the 2014 Winter Olympics, which Russia hosted in Sochi on the Black Sea and 65km away in the ski resort of Krasnaya Polyana.Then, ancient woodland in the Caucasus mountains was felled to make way for Putin’s pet project. Now, he hopes to use Russia’s forests – the biggest in the world, containing about a fifth of all trees – to help its energy firms make the painful transition to a greener future.Three decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the vast hydrocarbon reserves that underpinned its economy are still Russia’s mainstay, and oil and gas sales account for more than half of export revenue and a third of the national budget.During his 21-year rule, Putin has repeatedly vowed to ersify Russia’s economy, but the latest rankings by the respected RBK newspaper show that the nation’s three biggest firms are oil and gas producers, and that nine of its 15 largest corporations work in hydrocarbons and power generation the equivalent US list, published by Forbes, includes only one energy company in the top 15.“Beginning in the 2030s, the external effects on Russia will be severe,” Thane Gustafson says of the impact of efforts to halt global warming in his new book Klimat, Russia in the Age of Climate Change.“Climate politics, technological change and energy transition outside Russia will cause a sharp drop in Russia’s income from the export of fossil fuels – mainly oil – which are the lifeblood of the economy,” the Georgetown University professor explains.“The resulting massive loss of wealth will affect Russian citizens at all levels but will especially impact the state... This in turn will have major consequences for Russia’s position in the global economy, and its standing as a great power.”Gustafson thinks climate change could help boost Russia’s already booming agricultural sector, increase cargo shipping along its Arctic coast, and raise international demand for its nuclear power technology and liquefied natural gas.But he estimates that the global shift away from oil, coal and eventually gas could cause Russia’s total export income to fall by about 30 per cent by 2050.“The core question is, if peak oil demand comes to pass and peak gas demand comes to pass in Europe, then what else have the Russians got?” Gustafson told The .“The big story is that all the alternatives, when you compare them to today’s export revenues from oil and gas, just don’t add up.”Wildfires and floodsPutin (69) was dismissive of climate change for years, but now addresses the issue often and said last month that Russia wanted to be carbon neutral by 2060.Moscow has been alarmed by major wildfires and floods and by some thawing of the permafrost that covers 65 per cent of Russia, where scientists say national temperatures are rising 2.5 times faster than the global average.The EU’s announcement in July of plans to introduce a special carbon tax on imports from 2026 also focused the minds of Russian officials.Igor Sechin, the head of Kremlin-controlled Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil firm, has reportedly warned the Kremlin that the tariff could cost the country far more than western sanctions imposed over its undeclared war against Ukraine.The tax will be levied initially on carbon-intensive products such as steel, aluminium and fertiliser, but Russia fears it could be expanded to cover oil and gas imports as the EU accelerates its move away from fossil fuels.Moscow frames the EU tax as an attack on Russian industry, and Putin has urged countries “to put aside political and other differences and not turn the transition to carbon neutrality into an instrument of unfair competition”.Weapon against RussiaRussian media are giving considerable coverage to climate issues now that they are on the Kremlin agenda, yet much reporting on Cop26 echoes the claim that the West is using the shift to greener energy as a weapon against Russia.The popular Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper told readers during Cop26 that Washington saw the climate crisis as a way to “control the development of sovereign states”.“With this approach, countries for which sovereignty has not yet become an empty phrase will be blamed for any failures of the climate agenda,” the newspaper wrote. “This is probably why the heads of Russia, China, Brazil, Turkey and some other developed countries are not at the Glasgow summit.”He made clear what the Kremlin wants from the West at Cop26: for nuclear power – the source of 20 per cent of Russian electricity – to be recognised as clean energy acceptance of Russia’s estimate of how much carbon its vast forests can swallow and willingness to recognise a future Russian carbon trading system that would allow its polluters to offset emissions by planting and protecting trees.In a recorded speech to the summit, Putin said Russia’s bid to reach net-zero emissions by 2060 relied in part “on the unique natural resource of its forest ecosystems and their significant capacity to absorb carbon dioxide”.“We are taking the strongest and most vigorous measures to conserve them, improving forest management, fighting illegal logging and forest fires, increasing the area of reforestation and steadily increasing funding for these purposes,” he said.Putin has said Russia’s forests can absorb “billions of tonnes” of greenhouse gasses and his deputy prime minister, Viktoria Abramchenko, has put the figure at 2.5 billion tonnes annually – enough to make Russia carbon neutral at a stroke.Carbon tariffsRussian officials and business chiefs are also discussing the creation of national system of carbon tariffs, which they hope would allow firms to pay a pollution tax to Moscow instead of to Brussels and exempt them from EU levies.Sceptics say agreement on how Russia is managing and monitoring its forests and whether its biggest firms are really paying their taxes requires a level of trust that is glaringly absent from relations between Moscow and the West.They also criticise the Kremlin’s focus on how much pollution Russia’s forests can absorb, rather than on cutting emissions or reliance on fossil fuels, but see it as no surprise in an economy built around energy giants run by men like Sechin and Gazprom chief executive Alexei Miller, who have worked with Putin since the 1990s.“Taken as a whole, the history of the Putin era can be summed up as one of the dominant political power of the hydrocarbon lobby, backed by Putin’s closest allies and underpinned by the security establishment,” Gustafson writes in Klimat.“Putin’s policy has deepened Russia’s dependence on natural resource exports, and the longer it continues, the more vulnerable Russia will become, as the effects of climate change, both external and internal, gather strength. Elite conversation in Russia today is just beginning to recognise this problem.”Speaking from the US, Gustafson said there was now “a swirl of voices, a swirl of interests” in Moscow around climate change.“They are fully up to speed on the issues, threats and narratives and the conversations going on in the West. How do they react? That depends who they are.”Anit-Moscow conspiracyPowerful hard-liners such as Russian security council chief Nikolai Patrushev tend to regard the topic as an anti-Moscow conspiracy, while liberal reformers hope it provides impetus for the economic overhaul they have sought for many years.Gazprom seeks a long energy transition via the “bridge” fuel of gas, and talks about filling pipelines with hydrogen when that cleaner future finally comes.Sechin argues that oil demand will hold up for longer than many predict, and that Russia and Rosneft can make huge profits by continuing to invest in the oil sector as western majors switch their focus and funding to alternative energy.It is a risky and expensive bet: Rosneft is pushing on with its immense €120 billion Vostok project in the Arctic even as some researchers warn that if big economies hit their carbon-emission targets, more than €1 trillion in Russian energy assets such as drilling rigs and pipelines could be worthless by 2036.That is also when Putin, in power since 2000, will no longer be eligible for the presidency, according to constitutional amendments that he signed this year.In the name of “stability”, Putin and his allies have devoted much of their energy to holding back reforms. In the next two decades, a generation of postponed changes – political, economic and environmental – may crash over Russia in a single wave.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Energy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"army must get ship order embracing wokery","story":"There is a certain irony that it is only a month since the British Army published, with great fanfare, its official book on what makes its leadership so successful. The Habit of Excellence: Why British Army Leadership works cites glowing reviews from notable figures such as General David Petraeus, former Director of the CIA and Eddie Jones, the England Rugby Union coach, all of whom declare Lieutenant Colonel Langley Sharp’s book as essential reading. In light of recent events perhaps some of those higher up the Army’s chain-of-command should find time to read it.The intervention this week of the Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, summoning the Army Board for an unprecedented admonishment amid a slew of revelations, sackings and scandals has been as necessary as it is extraordinary. The past few months have seen a torrid period for the British Army at home, distinct from its success during the evacuation from Afghanistan: The court-martial of Major-General Nick Welch for fraud, quickly followed by the removal from post of three Brigade Commanders in as many months after separate incidents of bullying and fraud The suicide of a female Officer Cadet at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst following what may be numerous safeguarding failings by Officers and Senior NCOs on the directing staff The Army’s Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Defence Chiefs, WO1 Glenn Haughton, leaving his post under investigation for breaching the Army’s Values and Standards following allegations of conducting an improper relationship Furthermore, the shocking allegations that have resurfaced regarding a potential “cover-up” of the murder of Agnes Wanjiru, a 21-year-old Kenyan woman, during a post-training exercise night out in Nanyuki in 2012 is a disturbing reminder that these problems reach further than a lack of grip by the current hierarchy. The Army finds itself in a constant cycle of reinvention, as it adapts not only to the ever-evolving nature of the threat it exists to combat but also the endless challenge of recruitment and retention. The need to appeal to a new generation of potential recruits sees it struggle to maintain the delicate balance between the need to be progressive and its instinct to remain mired in the outdated. The adoption of woke policies sits in uneasy juxtaposition with a mindset that is, at its heart, anything but.The invitation this week, now hastily withdrawn, to Extinction Rebellion’s Chris Taylor to speak at a forthcoming conference hosted by The Centre for Army Leadership is a prime example of how it is easier to announce the adoption of eye-catching topical trends than to tackle the awkward systemic cultural change required.The investigation this summer by the Defence Sub-Committee led by Sarah Atherton MP into the experiences of female soldiers uncovered a litany of abuse from bullying to sexual harassment, underpinned by a grossly inadequate complaints procedure. Meanwhile, the MOD issued a new inclusive language guide telling staff to be careful using the word female less it “erases gender non-conforming people and members of the trans community”. On Monday evening The Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, announced that the Army would introduce a series of actions to accelerate said required cultural changes, including an independent audit of Army Culture itself. This is in jarring contrast to General Sir Nick Carter, the outgoing Chief of the Defence Staff, recently explaining to the Defence Select Committee that the Army fosters a “laddish culture” because soldiers need to be prepared to fight the enemy. Such a swift volte-face does not augur well for the Army’s impending Damascene conversion those who have fostered such a culture in the first place, may not be the best-equipped people to resolve the issue. Less an example of poacher-turned-gamekeeper than poacher-cum-gamekeeper.The Army makes much of its Leadership Code, the values and standards that serve as its moral lodestar and govern the behaviour of its officers and soldiers. It is evident that it needs to focus on the deep-rooted cultural issues and the messy business of holding senior officers to account, rather than the favourable optics of skirmishing in culture wars. The onus should be upon the core value of moral courage, doing the right thing under difficult circumstances. Quietly ushering out those who fail the service test is the easy thing, rather than the right thing. The Chief of the General Staff shouldn’t need to be hand-held by the Secretary of State for Defence in order to confront awkward issues or be corralled into the release of a carefully choreographed joint statement. The Habit of Excellence outlines that leadership is about the habitual practice of doing what is right, difficult and necessary every single day. In reforming service culture, the Army’s Senior Leadership would do well to heed their own advice. More from NewsThere is no such thing as too much Agatha ChristieSecret to mastering golf - play with your other handWednesday evening UK news briefing: MPs who break rules must be \u0026#39punished\u0026#39 says Boris Johnson amid Geoffrey Cox rowWhy the traditional Anchorman could be a dying breedBarbican to weed out racism after some staff presumed ‘all black artists smoke cannabis’‘I’ve collected more than £1million for the Poppy Appeal over the last 75 years – it’s my duty’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"israeli ambassador uk evacuated lse security amid pro palestinian","story":"The Home Secretary has said she is disgusted by the treatment of the Israeli ambassador who was forced to flee the London School of Economics (LSE) after activists called for her to be no platformed. Police were called to the entrance of the LSE, where students were among those demonstrating against Tzipi Hotovely, who was addressing the university\u0027s debating society. The pro-Palestinian activists gathered outside to call for Tzipi Hotovely to be no-platformed and chanted that Israel is a terrorist state.The ambassador had to be whisked away under heavy security, and now Priti Patel has said Scotland Yard has her full backing to investigate. She said: Disgusted by the treatment of the Israeli Ambassador at LSE last night. Antisemitism has no place in our universities or our country. I will continue to do everything possible to keep the Jewish community safe from intimidation, harrassment \u0026amp abuse.I have been in touch with Tzipi Hotovely and the police have my full backing in investigating this appalling incident. Video from the scene on Tuesday night showed security guards rushing Ms Hotovely to a vehicle as others attempted to fend off a group of protesters who can be heard chanting, Aren\u0027t you ashamed?.The ambassador, who left the building clutching a bouquet of flowers, was then driven away. Sharing the video, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said it was deeply disturbing, adding that he was so sorry to Ms Hotovely. Middle East minister James Cleverly said: We value open debate and peaceful protest. The aggressive and threatening behaviour directed at Israeli Ambassador Hotovely last night was unacceptable.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss called the treatment of the Israeli ambassador unacceptable, while Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi described the footage as deeply disturbing.Home Secretary Priti Patel said she was disgusted by the treatment of Ms Hotovely and added that the police have her full support in investigating the appalling incident.Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, who shared a video of the protests outside the event on Twitter, added: This is absolutely shocking. At a London university.On the protests, Ms Truss tweeted: We in Britain believe in freedom of speech. The treatment of Israeli Ambassador @TzipiHotovely last night and the attempt to silence her was unacceptable.Ms Hotovely had been invited by the university’s student union to take part in a debate, but the move drew widespread opoosition from pro-Palestinian groups on campus, who claimed it was platforming racism.The LSE said the ambassador spoke at the event and took questions before leaving on schedule.However, the university added that it was aware of some threats of violence made on social media and said it would review the processes around the event.Following the event, Ms Hotovely said: I\u0027m thankful for all the support I have received from the British Government, many friends and partners.I had an excellent event at LSE and I will not be intimidated. I will continue to share the Israeli story and hold open dialogue with all parts of British society.A spokesman for the LSE said: On Tuesday November 9, the LSESU Debate Society hosted the Israeli ambassador to the UK for an event on the LSE campus.The event, which attracted some protest outside, lasted approximately 90 minutes, with the ambassador speaking, taking questions from the audience and leaving on schedule.Free speech and freedom of expression underpins everything we do at LSE. Students, staff and visitors are strongly encouraged to discuss and debate the most pressing issues around the world, but this must be in a mutually respectful manner.Intimidation or threats of violence are completely unacceptable.We are aware of some threats of violence made on social media around this event. Any LSE students identified as being involved in making such threats will face disciplinary action.We will be reviewing the processes around this event to inform future planning.A statement from the Israeli Embassy said: Ambassador Hotovely was invited to speak with students at the LSE titled the \u0027New Era in the Middle East\u0027. It was a successful, open and fruitful discussion that went ahead as planned.Outside the venue, there was a demonstration organised by Palestinian and Islamic societies across London universities. British police maintained order at the scene.The violence we witnessed when the ambassador left the premises after the talk will not deter Israeli diplomats from engaging in meaningful dialogue with all parts of the British society.The protests specifically targeted Hotovely, according to The Times of Israel, saying that she had advocated for settler colonialism, engaged in Islamophobic rhetoric and has perpetuated anti-Palestinian racism.The ambassador is a member of former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u0027s Likud party. He appointed her to the post after she had served as settlements minister, but it sparked a petition by British-based group Na\u0027amod - which calls itself a movement of British Jews seeking to end our community’s support for the occupation, and to mobilise it in the struggle for freedom, equality and justice for all Palestinians and Israelis.Last year\u0027s petition, which drew almost 2,000 signatures, read: Hotovely has an appalling record of racist and inflammatory behavior from throughout her political career.As British Jews we are clear: Tzipi Hotovely’s values and politics have no place in the UK. It is crucial that the UK government sends a message that her views are unacceptable, and rejects her nomination as ambassador.The LSE debating society is next week hosting Husam Zomlot, Head of the Palestinian Mission to the UK. The debate entitled, Israel’s Perspective: A New Era in the Middle East would discuss the Palestinian conflict, according to a description of the event from the debating society. More from NewsThere is no such thing as too much Agatha ChristieSecret to mastering golf -

who famously impersonated the Nazi leader as Basil Fawlty in the BBC\u0027s Fawlty Towers - said he was blacklisting himself before someone else did. In a statement, he said: I apologise to anyone at Cambridge who was hoping to talk with me, but perhaps some of you can find a venue where woke rules do not apply.I was looking forward to talking to students at the Cambridge Union this Friday, but I hear that someone there has been blacklisted for doing an impersonation of Hitler I regret that I did the same on a Monty Python show, so I am blacklisting myself before someone else does.The 82-year-old actor was listed as a headline speaker in the Union\u0027s programme for this Friday. He was scheduled to appear with his Channel 4 production team to discuss his new documentary series on woke culture. The event in the Union termcard reads: John Cleese co-founded Monty Python, now often cited as the most influential comedy group there has ever been. Cleese wrote and starred in Python sketch shows and films such as Life of Brian and Monty Python\u0027s Flying Circus, before branching off into different writing and acting ventures, such as Fawlty Towers and Time Bandits. Cleese started off his career while at Downing College in the Cambridge Footlights, a comedy society founded inside our very own building.He is now filming a documentary series on \u0027woke culture\u0027 for Channel 4, which will include footage from our event.The Cambridge Union proudly boasts of defending free speech since 1815 on the main page of its website, saying in its mission statement: From its small beginnings as a debating society, the Cambridge Union now has over 70,000 life members worldwide. Now the oldest debating society in the world, and the largest student society in Cambridge, the Union remains a unique forum for the free exchange of ideas and the art of public debate.The Union Society is proud of our long and extensive tradition of hosting prominent figures from all areas of public life, including the Dalai Lama, President Ronald Reagan, Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking, Prime Ministers Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher, and John Major.Cleese\u0027s withdrawal comes as Keir Bradwell, the student president of the 200-year-old debating society, emailed members on Monday to inform them he was setting up a blacklist of speakers that would include Andrew Graham-Dixon, an art historian who offended students with a Nazi impersonation last week.He did an impression of Adolf Hitler to demonstrate the Nazis had bad taste because they rejected some art because they were racist.Mr Bradwell, who describes himself as a conservative, wrote that he would create a blacklist of speakers never to be invited back, and we will share it with other unions too, adding: Andrew will be on that list.In response, Mr Graham-Dixon has said in a statement: Mr Bradwell’s implication that I am racist and anti-Semitic by placing me on his list is utterly rejected, and in the context surprising. The speech I gave was a strident attack on Hitler’s racism and anti-Semitism.More from NewsThere is no such thing as too much Agatha ChristieSecret to mastering golf -

The report also called for the building of more refuge areas to ensure that drivers breaking down would never be more than a mile from such a place. There was also a dignified demonstration in which families of those who had lost loved ones in live lane crashes carried coffins outside Parliament. Those families and the Members of the Commons Transport Select Committee are clearly objectively right.  Breaking down on a motorway is a very unpleasant experience, but at least on a normal motorway one can usually get one’s car onto the hard shoulder and take refuge oneself behind a stout barrier.A year ago Transport Secretary Grant Shapps ordered that no more motorways should be designated as “Smart” before new software to detect broken down vehicles had been installed.  However, it is also essential that there should be somewhere safe not only for the driver of a broken down vehicle, but for any passengers, especially any disabled or wheelchair users and children including those in prams or carry cots. The trouble is that designating a motorway as “Smart” costs nothing, but enables the Transport Department to claim that an extra lane has been put in place.It is a life threatening nonsense that should be ended.I wrote a fortnight ago about the  prosecution of former soldier Dennis Hutchings for murder over a death in Northern Ireland almost half a century ago.  That trial came to an end when Hutchings, who was 80 years old and in ill health with kidney failure died during his trial last week. Initially the Army refused to allow his former Regiment, The Life Guards, to provide pall bearers, but then came a change of mind and Hutchings’ coffin was borne to his grave by men of that Regiment.Despite the sacrifices made by men such as Hutchings and despite Tony Blair’s deals which he hoped would end  the “troubles”,  a double decker bus was hijacked and set on fire in Newtownards last week.  Nichola Mallon, the Social Democratic and Labour Party infrastructure Minister rightly described the culprits as “cowards with covered faces who had done nothing more than attack their own community.”   Sadly there seems to an ongoing supply of such men who see themselves not as cowards, but as heroes.It was yet another Irish tragedy that Airey Neave the heroic escapee from Coldritz Castle, the most secure prison in Nazi Germany, who would have been Margaret Thatcher’s Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was murdered on the eve of General Election victory of 1979.  He understood that there is but one way to deal with terrorists.Both as a member of the House of Lords and because I would count myself as something of a friend of Owen Paterson and his late wife, I have to be careful what I say about the circumstances leading up to her suicide and his resignation from the House of Commons.  The latter was. I think, in the best interests of both Paterson and his family.The is nothing wrong with a Member of Parliament accepting money for giving advice on government policy to commercial businesses.  The more difficult area is where a Member is paid to tell Government Ministers of the effect of Government policy on a business or a whole industry. Even more so when the Member urges ministers to adopt or change policies in a way that would benefit that commercial interest which is paying him. That is to become a lobbyist.Above all it is essential that the Member ensures that both the Minister and his relevant civil service advisers know of his financial interest.But I hope that Sir Keir Starmer and his Opposition colleagues will pause and think before they wade in with cries of “Tory Sleaze”.    In the event that Labour came into office their Ministers would be lobbied by Labour members pushing private interests, not least those of trades unions.There are a good many sensible Labour Members of the Commons, even more in the Lords who should think about these matters and quietly discuss them, not just between themselves but with Ministers too.More from NewsThere is no such thing as too much Agatha ChristieSecret to mastering golf - play with your other handWednesday evening UK news briefing: MPs who break rules must be \u0026#39punished\u0026#39 says Boris Johnson amid Geoffrey Cox rowWhy the traditional Anchorman could be a dying breedBarbican to weed out racism after some staff presumed ‘all black artists smoke cannabis’‘I’ve collected more than £1million for the Poppy Appeal over the last 75 years – it’s my duty’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"traditional anchorman could dying breed","story":"Newsreading is “an occupation for an articulated suit”, according to Jeremy Paxman. “Do you remember reading aloud at school? That’s what it is. I don’t think it has any grandeur or skill. Any fool can do it.”It’s a sentiment echoed by John Ryley, the head of Sky News, who recently declared the end of the era of the “all-powerful anchor” reporters were now experts. The future of news, he explained, is digital, with the headlines available on mobile phones whenever the viewer chooses, rather than delivered – with a bong of Big Ben – on the hour.In perhaps not unconnected news, Adam Boulton, the channel’s editor-at-large this week announced that he is to leave after 33 years.In Boulton’s words, that means he and fellow Sky News anchor Dermot Murnaghan have “had our day.”As Boulton’s long innings at Sky comes to an end, over at New Broadcasting House, a different endgame seems to be playing out around Edwards. The Welshman’s situation is different – he’s still very much employed – but the image he cuts is of a man so miserable with his lot, it’s almost painful to watch.In August, he told Radio Cymru he is considering his future presenting the nightly news – after 20 years, he said mournfully, it can be “taxing”. “Now that a big milestone is here, which is 60 years old, it’s natural for a man to think: ‘Am I going to continue in this job for another five years, or do I want to do something different?’”In recent months, Edwards has seemed to take an almost mischievous delight in antagonising his employer on social media. In March, after BBC Breakfast presenters Naga Munchetty and Charlie Stayt had their wrists slapped for appearing to laugh at housing secretary Robert Jenrick’s prominent union flag, Edwards posted an image of him in front of the Welsh flag alongside the caption: “Flags are now mandatory – very pleased with my new backdrop for BBC News at Ten”. When he was ordered to take down the post, he responded: “Gutted. My pro-flag tweet has been cut down in its prime. By order.”Last week, he skirted the corporation’s rules on impartiality again, after positing his concerns over the National Museum of Wales taking down a portrait of the slave trader Sir Thomas Picton. “As a journalist, I feel uneasy about this element of ‘censoring’ history,” he tweeted. “Should not Picton remain on display as a reminder to Wales of an aspect of its past – no matter how disgraceful?”Even discussing Remembrance Sunday this week, Edwards managed to slip in a sly reference to a possible departure. “Every year, I feel humbled by the sight of veterans and their families, proud and dignified, often mourning the loss of comrades or loved ones,” he told the Radio Times. “I will still be attending long after my BBC duties are done.”Boulton believes men like him have had their run – but you feel that Edwards is convinced he’s got a lot yet to offer. He is reported to have sounded out ITV to see if he could fill Piers Morgan’s empty chair – now occupied by the sprightly 65-year-old Richard Madeley.Sources claimed Edwards, in an exceptionally unusual move, hoped to maintain his position as the BBC’s go-to presenter for national events including general elections and Royal occasions. Perhaps unsurprisingly, talks did not materialise into a job offer. The  has contacted the BBC about these apparent ambitions, but the corporation “does not comment on rumour”.Certainly, BBC colleagues would not be too sad to see Edwards go. One said he was “part of a group of middle-aged men in news with egos the size of planets”. There was spluttering when he gave a recent interview complaining that colleagues had received pay rises while his own salary had been cut (from a highest level of £550,000-£599,999, to between £465,000 and £469,999 in 2019-2020), to help tackle gender pay differences at the BBC). “The reaction among the rest of us was: Huw, you earn more than £400,000 a year. Honestly, shut up,” said one long-standing BBC presenter.Would he be welcomed elsewhere in the industry? “There has been a huge swirl around Huw, but I don’t get where he thinks his market value is,” says one senior ITN figure.At the crux of all this is a delicate question: is there a place in primetime news for middle-aged, white, male behemoths like Boulton and Edwards? Boulton touched on it his interview, hinting that “television is very sensitive to the idea of ersity” – but in this case that ersity cuts both ways. The old-school anchorman may be a target of ire behind the scenes due to his Establishment background and accompanying ego, yet Boomers can play the ‘-ism’ card as well as anyone, and ageism is never a good look.Perhaps that’s why it’s taking so long for the guard to change. Or maybe the anchormen are just too expensive. Industry observers suggest that in days gone by, someone would have put a gentle hand on the shoulder of an unwanted newsreader and suggested he play a few more rounds of golf. Today, it would take a HR machine – and, you suspect, a hefty severance package – to achieve the same outcome.Anchors-in-waiting include Reeta Chakrabati, filling in on the News at One, Six, Ten and the weekends the BBC Breakfast team of Louise Minchin, Naga Munchetty and current Strictly contestant Dan Walker and even the Newsnight team of Faisal Islam, Emily Maitliss and Emma Barnett. Although what Paxman would make of such a move is probably not even for the ears of podcast listeners.For the older anchor, the equation is complicated. Boulton is right when he says that it’s older people who watch TV: data from from Enders Analysis shows that, before lockdown (when everything got thrown up in the air), the average age of the BBC One viewer was 61, ITV’s was 60, Channel 4’s was 55 even E4, a youth spin-off from Channel 4, mainly attracted 42-year-olds. How do these channels appeal to a fresh cohort without alienating the existing viewers – especially in news, which is traditionally shunned by younger people? And anyway, is it really the case that we only want to watch our own age group tell us about important things?Fortunately, there is a very simple way of measuring this. YouGov has a running “popularity and fame” tracker, updated quarterly and based on “millions of responses from the British public”. Edwards currently ranks 88th on the list of Popular Contemporary TV personalities poor old Boulton comes in at 436th.So, who is the most famous, the most popular and the most-loved TV personality in the country? Who can it be who is loved by 65 per cent of millennials, 84 per cent of Gen-Xers and 89 per cent of Boomers? It’s white, Oxford-educated, 95-year-old Sir David Attenborough. Sir Trevor McDonald, the 82-year-old who presented his final News at Ten on ITV in 2008, comes in second.Breaking news – there is life in old dogs yet.More from NewsThere is no such thing as too much Agatha ChristieSecret to mastering golf - play with your other handWednesday evening UK news briefing: MPs who break rules must be \u0026#39punished\u0026#39 says Boris Johnson amid Geoffrey Cox rowBarbican to weed out racism after some staff presumed ‘all black artists smoke cannabis’‘I’ve collected more than £1million for the Poppy Appeal over the last 75 years – it’s my duty’World’s longest serving female sailor has spent just one day at sea – and ‘didn’t like it much’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"worlds longest serving female sailor has spent just one day","story":"A Wren has been awarded the Guinness World Record for the longest serving female sailor despite only ever spending one day at sea.Warrant Officer Class One Barbara McGregor left the Royal Navy having served 43 years and 189 days.WO1 McGregor joined the Women’s Royal Naval Service (officially known as the Wrens) on July 26 1977, and planned to stay for just four years to enjoy a bit of sport and adventure.Joining 16 years before women were allowed to go to sea, she chose to remain on shore-based postings.“I did spend a day at sea while I was serving in Gibraltar,” she said, “and I didn’t like it much”.“It’s a different world now.

But what does the COP deal mean - and why’s it being branded a ‘fudge’ Boris Johnson speaking today at the COP summit in Glasgow Image: Getty ImagesByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Nov | commentsBoris Johnson dashed to the COP summit in Glasgow today as he warned of “colossal” impactstalks fail.The Prime Minister admitted there is a huge amount to do and talks have now entered the hard yards”. He claimed the world is “closer than it has ever been” to kick-starting the “beginning of the end” of man-made climate change. But he added: “It’s very frustrating to see countries that have spent six years conspicuously patting themselves on the back… edging towards default now vulnerable nations are demanding payment, here, now in Glasgow.”The gathering of nearly  nations is meant to finish on Friday - though could run into Saturday - and has produced a draft of its overall agreement. The cover decision - issued six hours later than planned after late-night talks - reaffirms pledges to limit global temperature rises and cut emissions.It will now be discussed by all the countries involved in the UN summit and likely watered down before it can be rubber-stamped at the end of the week. But after Greta Thunberg accused world leaders of “blah blah”, campaigners are warning it simply doesn’t go far enough on the key issues of our time. Former MP Gordon Brown said the draft agreement was “an admission of prospective failure” - as it accepts that another meeting is required to agree on key pledges.He suggested Boris Johnson was treating the event “like a day trip”, and urged him to remain in Glasgow until the end of the summit to strike a deal. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband added: Itaposs hard to avoid the suspicion that the Prime Minister sees a day trip to the Cop as a useful way of distracting from the sleaze surrounding the Tory Party rather than a chance to get a grip and engage in the substance like a statesman. Greenpeace today claimed the document was especially worrying because it is already “weak” - and will normally become weaker as it’s negotiated into something all nations can accept. So what does the agreement actually say and what are the biggest holes in it  Here’s a brief explainer…We’ll have to go back againIn fairness, the main goal of COP was never to limit global temperature rises to .C in one fell swoop - only to keep the dream “alive”. But the document lays bare just how much more work there is to do, despite two weeks of talks in Glasgow and side deals on coal, cars, cash and trees. The document urges sluggish countries to submit their updated climate plans as soon as possible before November  - after they missed a deadline to get them over this autumn. And it calls for another meeting of world leaders in  to give updated pledges. .C may be on le supportThe draft cover text “reaffirms” the  Paris Agreement - but that only ever pledged to “pursue efforts” to limit global temperature rises to .C. It does not go further and commit countries to hold the increase this century below .C. Indeed, it “expresses alarm and concern that human activities have caused around . °C of warming to date”. And Boris Johnson said of the .C target: “I think it’s in the balance… we’re now finding things tough. But it doesn’t mean it’s impossible. The draft document does call for “meaningful and effective action by all Parties in this critical decade” - including a % cut in carbon dioxide emissions by . But John Ashton, a former climate change envoy for the UK government, warned: “Thereaposs a huge gap between the pledges and the plans that are on the table and whataposs actually needed to keep .C on the table. “Itaposs a very dangerous and delicate situation for the negotiators. The whole thing will be balanced on a kne edge.”Coal and fossil fuels ‘not good enough’UK officials hailed parts of the draft text, including a proposed commitment to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels. There has been a deal for many developed countries to stop using coal by the s and others by the s.But Labour argues this has been watered down from hard dates of  and  - and doesn’t include China, the US, India or Australia.Greenpeace added the draft of the final decision “completely fails to mention fossil fuels”, adding: “The first draft of the climate pact text is already exceptionally weak. Usually the text starts with some ambition, which then gets watered down. “To keep . alive, four words must be added: ‘fossil fuels phase out’, and countries must come back next year to close the gap.” Net Zero doesn’t have a firm dateUK officials were pleased with net zero commitments from India, Thailand, Nepal, Nigeria and Vietnam - with % of the world now offering them. But India has only pledged Net Zero by , which a UK official branded “curious” and predicted will sht forward. China, Russia and Saudi Arabia have all chosen  instead while Turkey has chosen . And the draft only commits to “net zero around mid-century” rather than a hard  date. Labour also says there are holes in the pledges, such as Australia committing to  but planning for  in line with a C world - or Saudi Arabia increasing oil production this decade.We still aren’t at billionThe text calls for “beyond” bn a year of climate finance. But the bn target was due in  and still hasn’t been hit, with it now projected to be met in  or . COP has seen fresh commitments from the UK, Spain, Japan, Australia, Norway, Ireland and Luxembourg. And the UK has pledged £.bn overall from  to . But Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, said: “Many countries are unable to pull out all the stops because they still havenapost received the climate finance promised for more than a decade.”Deforestation nations covering % of global forests signed a declaration to “halt and reverse” deforestation by . The UK said it was the biggest breakthrough on forests in a generation and a “massive success for COP”, while Boris Johnson said it would “end this great chainsaw massacre”. In the draft text it’s worded a little bit more generally - saying “protecting and restoring forests” is important to cut emissions. But almost immediately there were questions about how the plan will be enforced. Nations pledged in  to halve tropical deforestation by , but a report this year found it has increased. Less than  hours after the announcement, Boris Johnson accepted some governments might “break the pledges”. And Indonesia’s forestry minister said the  promise was “unfair”, despite his government signing it.

The Department of Health and Social Care accepted there may be a “signicant” hit to the health service workforce as millions are told ‘no jab, no job’.Ministers today announced patient-facing healthcare staff in England will need to have had both doses of vaccine by April , unless they have a medical exemption, as a condition of deployment.That includes doctors, nurses and dentists as well as cleaners, porters, ward clerks and receptionists. Private healthcare, unpaid volunteers, agency staff and trainees are all included.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the scales clearly tip to one side for mandatory jabs - due to our imperative to protect the NHS and those services upon which we all rely.But a government impact statement has now estimated , health and care staff could refuse to be vaccinated under the policy, without having a medical exemption.  That includes , staff in the NHS in England in a central scenario - .% of the workforce. It also includes , in private healthcare . And it includes , in social care , where jabs will become mandatory this Thursday. Once natural wastage is included the government estimates this figure at more like ,. The documents do not make clear whether all , staff would be working on the frontline currently. It appears possible that some are already in back office roles. Itaposs thought patient-facing staff who refuse to be jabbed will face being reassigned to back office roles or losing their jobs completely. The impact statement confirmed hospitals will have to pay for “recruiting replacements for workers who may not fulfil the requirement of having both doses of the vaccine”. This in turn could cause “potential disruption to health and care services”.  The impact statement warned there was a wide range of possibilities of how many health and care staff will get vaccinated in response to the scheme - anywhere from , to ,.It said there is signicant uncertainty about the final number of staff affected. However, it added: The impact on workforce levels and health and care services could be signicant. If a proportion of staff decides to leave the NHS, this would put pressure on NHS services. This is likely to be more acute in clinical staff groups where there are existing staff shortages and lags in labour supply caused by education and training requirements, but all services are likely to be impacted.It comes after unions and Labour warned of possible staff shortages.UNISON today warned some care homes could be forced to shut their doors and others will struggle to meet safe staffing levels.  On the NHS changes, UNISON head of health Sara Gorton added: This wasn’t something the government needed to do. “The effective and supportive approach taken by NHS trusts has persuaded the overwhelming majority of health staff to have both Covid shots. “Now this sledgehammer policy risks doing more harm than good. “Without knowing what proportion of staff are covered by exemptions, creating a new law seems extreme. “It will move effort and attention away from caring for Covid patients and clearing the backlog created by the pandemic.” Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth warned ministers to “proceed with caution”, adding: We simply cannot afford to lose thousands of NHS staff overnight. Some MPs sounded caution over the move - but others said it should have happened quicker. Tory MP Dr Andrew Murrison said: “If this has to be done, then it is better to do it quickly, and by the Spring, clearly we’re going to be past the winter pressures we’re all concerned about.” Mr Javid warned it cannot be business as usual when it comes to vaccination, adding: The first duty of everyone working in health and social care is to avoid preventable harm to the people they care for. “Not only that, they have a responsibility to do all they can to keep each other safe.” But Rachel Harrison of the GMB union warned: Bulldozing this vaccine will exacerbate the already crushing staffing crisis we face across the NHS and ambulance services. Both are operating under extreme pressures, after a decade of austerity and cuts, with an exhausted and demoralised workforce who are fearful of what is to come as we head through winter. Staff are already leaving their employment and this will certainly force many more to go. Royal College of Nursing General Secretary Pat Cullen added: The vast majority of NHS nursing staff received the COVID- vaccine as soon as it was offered, having led the vaccination roll out across the UK and continuing to do so with the booster programme. “With the five months until this decision takes effect, the government and employers must continue to engage with the small minority who have chosen not to have the vaccine. “This is vital to understanding their concerns, supporting them to understand the importance of the vaccine and to make that important choice.

According to parliamentaposs register of interests, Laurence Robertson is paid £, a year by the Betting and Gaming Council, an industry body that lobbies on behalf of bookmakers. In the past year, Mr Robertson has also been given free tickets by betting companies to horse-racing at Ascot, Test matches at Lord’s and England games at Wembley. He has also earned £, a month for ten hours’ work as the BGC’s “parliamentary adviser on sport and safer gambling”. While being employed by the BGC, he has spoken at least three times in parliament in defence of the gambling industry. In the past year, the Tewkesbury MP told ministers there is a “great danger” that a crackdown on gambling could push players to the black market and argued against greater regulation of the industry, the Times reported. Mr Robertson denies any conflict of interest. Last December, when the governmentaposs gambling review was announced, Mr Robertson demanded that the review was “evidence-based, consistent and balanced”. In July he said thatnew laws were “too stringent” then there would be “a great danger” that people would play on the black market and he told ministers that they needed to be “careful” about introducing new laws that could exacerbate the “worrying trend” of illicit gambling. In September, after the appointment of a new minister, he again said that the government review would be “evidence-based and evidence-led”.  It came as it was revealed Tory MPs wrote “sponsored content” for a lobbying group that backs the gambling industry, according to a report in the . They include government aide and Stoke South MP Jack Brereton, who penned an article for Conservative Home urging ministers to ensure the gambling review does “nothing to put the industry’s competitiveness at risk”. He also heaped praise on betting company Bet for the “huge economic contribution that the betting giant makes to our constituencies” including “high skilled, good quality jobs”. “It should also not be forgotten that Bet and its founders are the highest taxpayers in the UK, paying some £.m to the Treasury in   – money which will have helped fund vital public services like health and education, not just in Stoke-on-Trent but across the whole country,” the article said. The politicians were not paid for writing, but it is reported the Betting and Gaming Council paid the ConservativeHome website through an advertising agency for the space. One of the Tory MPs, Philip Davies wrote an article labelled “sponsored by the Betting and Gaming Council” that appeared on ConservativeHome in April. In June, he declared a ticket and hospitality box at Ascot Races with a value of £, paid for by the Betting and Gaming Council, in the MPs’ register of interests. The MP for Shipley did not comment when approached by the Mirror. Other Tory MPs who wrote sponsored content for the Betting and Gaming Council include Greg Smith, MP for Buckingham, who wrote a piece headlined “Betting shops are helping the high street get back on its feet” in June. His spokesperson said it was unpaid. Meanwhile, Workington MP Mark Jenkinson wrote a sponsored piece in July, saying he had “grave concerns about calls by some anti-gambling campaigners that limits should be placed on how much iniduals should be allowed to bet”. Jenkinson also declared a ticket and hospitality box at Ascot Races in June, with a value of £,, paid for by the Betting and Gaming Council. He did not respond to requests for comment. Mr Brereton also did not respond to requests for comment. Bet is a major employer in his constituency. A ConservativeHome spokesperson said: “Just like the , ConservativeHome carries advertising, which helps to provide high quality journalism for free to millions of readers each year.” It is understood ConservativeHome does not commission sponsored pieces but they are booked by advertisers via an agency in common with other media sources. Separately, the register of interests shows that ten MPs accepted tickets to Euro  football matches from betting companies.Eight Conservatives and two Labour MPs were gted tickets worth between £,. and £,.Matt Zarb-Cousin, from the campaign group Clean Up Gambling, said: The amount the gambling industryaposs spent on hospitality for MPs is an indication of how desperate they are to make some friends in Parliament. But putting supportive MPs on their actual payroll, and turning the gambling lobby into a career safety net for MPs who lose their seats, is yet another example of the murky revolving door that exists between politics and lobbying.

Jayne Winteringham, , spends time cooking herself a roast virtually every day, complete with Brussels sprouts, carrots and roast potatoes. The only time Jayne deviates from her rigid diet is when sheaposs out at one of her favourite restaurants. The retired nursery worker even claims her consistent calorie intake helps her to maintain her svelte size  figure. But last year on th December, Jayne relinquished control of her diet when she popped over to her daughteraposs house for dinner - and tucked into a Mexican-style dinner.“If I had been cooking, I would have made Christmas dinner.

She has been obsessed with Christmas since she was a little girl and reckons her love of the festive season in adulthood is down to childhood nostalgia and memories of her mum. She said: “It’s very much an everyday part of my le. It’s such a wholesome, nutritious and tasty meal.“I have fond memories of enjoying roast dinners as a child and I think it’s a very traditional and British staple.“The food available in this country has become a lot more cosmopolitan than it was when I was growing. We have things like pasta, rice, curries, French food, Italian food - while years ago, people’s diets weren’t as broad.“A Sunday roast was an absolute staple. You’d go to the butcher to get your meat and that would last you through the week.“After the roast, youaposd boil the chicken bones and make things like soup and bubble and squeak. So, for me, it reminds me of my childhood.” As a kid, Jayne looked forward to her Sunday roast every week, and carried her love into adulthood by preparing the dish more often.She said: “For the past two decades I’ve eaten it every day - bar December  . It’s just something I never get sick of. She added that, since her kids left home, it became easier to cook whatever she wanted. Thereaposs no one to stop me, she joked. “I think itaposs why I’ve maintained my size  figure over the years, because I consistently consume the same number of calories every day.” Whereas many Brits agree itaposs tricky to prepare a Christmas dinner, Jayne, who has mastered her craft by now, says itaposs a simple issue of timing.  “Time things so they can cook without you having to supervise them too much. Then pop everything in big bowls and put them on the table when theyaposre ready, so people can help themselves,” she said.After years of sampling countless dferent types of Christmas dinner, Jayne now considers herself a roast connoisseur.She said: “I love all kinds of roasts, especially when you go to a carvery and they give you a giant Yorkshire pudding the size of the plate and then you can pile the rest of your roast on top of it.“When I make mine at home it’s very simple. I’ve got it down to a fine art.“I buy everything fresh each day from my local shop and use the meat juices for my gravy. There’s no such thing as a bad roast.“EvenIaposm getting a takeaway, my favourite thing to do is to order a roast from my local restaurant.”However, on th December, Jayne opts to have a rest while her daughter takes over cooking for the day She said: “It’s the one day of the year when I never have to cook for myself. “She’ll always go overboard with it because she loves cooking and serves up a fantastic meal. It ies slightly every year, but as long as there’s gravy, which is my absolute favourite part of Christmas dinner, then I’m very happy. “Good gravy is very important.

Harry Byrne has spent the last three months covering more than , miles with the help of a team of dedicated ‘moon trekkers’, for his little brother Reuben, two. Reuben was born with a condition that causes his brain to deteriorate and so rare it doesn’t have a name yet - and there are fewer than  recorded cases worldwide. Doting brother Harry often tells his younger brother he loves him “to the moon and back”, and wanted to prove it by travelling the circumference of the moon - a feat that he remarkably managed twice. From July  to October , Harry, from Larkhill, Wilts., spent every day ticking off the miles - from walking to school and back, to running a mile around his local football pitch at the half-time of a match. Determined Harry even clocked up an impressive  miles in a single day, when he and his best friend walked from Avebury to Stonehenge - a trek which took them almost  hours. And proud mum Sophie Byrne, , said that all the while, Reuben has been Harry’s “number one cheerleader” - even finishing off Harry’s final mile with him, as Harry pushed his brother’s pram along with his bike. Sophie, who is also mum to eight-month-old Felix, said: “We’re so proud of Harry for everything he’s done. “Not only has he raised money and awareness of Reuben’s condition, but he’s also created all these amazing memories with his little brother, which is just priceless.  “Harry’s favourite parts of the challenge were the bits where Reuben was there with him - like when he cycled the last mile with Reuben, or when I got into the pool with Reuben to watch Harry swim a mile. “We’re not sure how much Reuben can actually see, and he doesn’t really understand a lot of what’s going on around him. “But he does occasionally give a big smile or even a laugh, and that’s when you know he’s really happy, overjoyed - and I think those moments have spurred Harry on a lot in the last few months.” And proud Harry added: “My favourite part was when Reuben and I went on the bike together. I really enjoyed that.  “Some of it was really tiring, but having lots of support from friends made it easier. “I really want to keep raising more money for Reuben, because it makes me feel really good.” Sadly, Reuben is Sophie’s second child with her husband Sean, , to be born with the unnamed, le-limiting condition - which is caused by a PIGB genetic mutation. Nine years ago, the couple had a daughter called Olivia who was also born with the same condition - and passed away aged nine months old, before Harry was born.  Sophie said: “When Reuben was born with the same thing, I knew instantly, because of Olivia. It was like lightning had struck in the same place twice. “As far as doctors know, there have been fewer than  recorded cases of this condition worldwide - and two of them are my own children. “The longest surviving child with this condition lived to the age of just five years old.” But Sophie added: “We’ve always talked quite openly and positively with Harry about Reuben, and about Olivia, too. “It’s something that you can either let take you to a really dark place, or you can turn it into something positive - like Harry has done.  “Things that happen in your childhood can really affect you in adulthood - so we wanted Harry to be able to look back and think of all the amazing memories he created with Reuben. “After Olivia passed away, Sean and I did the Three Peaks Challenge to raise money for the hospices that had cared for her. “And Harry wanted to do something similar to support the hospices that help his little brother.” Harry has so far raised a whopping £, - £, from his ‘round the moon’ challenge, and £, from taking on a -mile walk over three days earlier this year.  The youngster walked between Julia’s House Hospice in Devizes, Wilts., and Naomi House in Sutton Scotney, Hants. - the two hospices that help care for Reuben. And the money he has raised so far will be ided between the two hospices, as a token of gratitude for the work they do. Sophie said: “We’ve been really touched by the generosity of kind strangers during this challenge. “We’ve had a team of about  people over the last three months getting out and donating miles towards Harry’s total, including from as far as Australia and Canada.The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news.

If the misplaced tube had been replaced earlier Mohammed would not have died when he did, the hearing concluded, reports the Manchester Evening News. The hospitalaposs own guidelines said that the tube - known as an umbilical venous catheter- should only be in place for a maximum of  hours. By the time Mohammedaposs condition deteriorated at pm on November , , the tube had been in for  hours.Senior coroner for North Manchester Joanne Kearsley was told that the Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, had admitted a series of failings in the care of Mohammed.The trust said that it was known shortly after the UVC had been inserted that it was apossub-optimal , but that it was acceptable to continue to use it for a short period of time until the little boy was stable and additional access could be obtained.  The trust admitted that there were aposmissed opportunitiesapos to communicate the plan to gain alternative access and to attempt this from the day sht of Monday, November , apos. It also admitted there was a breakdown in communications between doctors over the replacement of the line and it was not documented in the notes. The handover between medical teams caring for Mohammed was verbal and not documented and the documentation of UVC positioning was apospoor and below standardapos. The trust also agreed that the positioning of the UVC contributed to the rupture of the liver capsule and contributed to Mohammedaposs death. Concluding the inquest, Miss Kearsley said she was satisfied that earlier attempts should have been made to try to establish alternative access. Mohammed was stable on the afternoon of November  and had been stable overnight on the night of the th. The coroner went on: A decision was made to defer the attempt to gain alternative access to the night team. Despite it being a priority that evening no attempt was made to secure alternative access.  We did hear that there were two other babies requiring line insertions and there were clinical pressures. On November  Mohammed was examined but there is no documentation to suggest that by pm, when Mohammed deteriorated, there had been any positive attempts to try to attempt alternative access. We are now some  hours almost from the insertion of the line. I am satisfied that there was an unacceptable delay in any attempt to secure alternative access. There was poor handover and no documentation that Mohammed had a sub-optimal line or of any plan to try to address this. I am equally satisfied that the UVC damaged the liver shortly before his deterioration of November . Once he had deteriorated, the team caring for him were not fully aware of the badly placed UVC, but I accept that it wouldnapost have made any dference by this point. She said: Iaposm satisfied Mohammed would not have died at the time he didit had not been for the sub-optimal UVC line, albeit Mohammed was, in any event, an extremely poorly baby and I do acknowledge the risk of sub-optimal positioning is a noted recognised complication of a UVC line. Ms Kearsley said that Mohammed died due to a recognised complication of a necessary procedure. Despite attempts to save Mohammedaposs le he died in the early hours of November , his death was caused due to bleeding from the liver caused by perforation by the UVC. Ms Kearsley also acknowledged that Royal Oldham Hospital had tightened up its procedures as a direct result of Mohammedaposs death. And she praised the dignity with which Mohammedaposs father Ommar Ahmed and Shabana Kousar, both , had behaved during the hearing. She told the couple, of Meldrum Street, Oldham: Youaposve waited a long time, itaposs nearly two years, but as parents, I canapost imagine how dficult it is waiting for a process. I thank you for your patience and understanding and the way that youaposve conducted yourselves in court today. It mustaposve been very dficult to listen to some of the evidence. After the hearing, Ommar told the Manchester Evening News: Our main concern is that these mistakes never get repeated again so that another family doesnapost have to go through the pain that we have. And he revealed the Mohammed had been born after a decade of the couple trying to start a family. Almost exactly a year later, on October , , their daughter Ayat Ahmed was born. We will never forget her older brother and he will always ben in our hearts, said Ommar, a security worker. A Northern Care Alliance NHS Trust spokesperson said after the hearing: “We would like to offer our sincere condolences to Mohammed’s family for their loss. Mohammed died of a recognised complication of a necessary medical procedure but we accept that there were failings in his care and we would like to apologise to his family for this. As an organisation we are committed to learning and steps have been taken to reduce the risk of similar failings in future, including updates to policy, training, improvements to documentation and audits to ensure compliance.” Comment MORE ON November HospitalsStarting a family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Darrell Meekcom, , says he has no regrets about showing his bum to a mobile speed van on November , despite police coming to his house minutes later to arrest him. His we Sarah, , filmed the arrest where the university lecturer and registered nurse is brought to the ground by six officers in their back garden in Kidderminster, Worcs. The disabled dad-of-two drew up a list of things he wanted to do before he died after he was diagnosed with multiple system atrophy last month. Mooning a speed camera for a laugh was one item, but now Darrell has vowed to go a step further and streak at a Worcester Warriors rugby game.  Darrell, who uses a wheelchair, said: I donapost regret anything and Iaposd do it again. I still maintain those officers have completely overreacted because I still havenapost seen anything about a law against mooning. If anything it has inspired me for another item on my bucket list which is to streak at a Worcester Warriors match. I canapost run though, so Iaposm going to need a mate to run on and push me in my wheelchair. They have got to streak too though so I just need some volunteers. Iaposve always been a goody-two-shoes nurse throughout my entire le and given my prognosis I now want to let my hair down a little. The other things on my bucket list are to drive a Jaguar XJ around Silverstone, do a bungee jump and a skye. But Iaposm still compiling it as we only came up with the idea last Thursday and on Friday I was arrested for ticking my first item off.  Darrell said he has heard nothing  from West Mercia Police since they stormed his property and arrested him last week. He added: Iaposm still annoyed but Iaposve had a fantastic response from everybody and lots of people are showing me support. It has also hopefully raised some awareness about multiple system atrophy, which I donapost think most people know much about. I try to look at the positives and thataposs why I wonapost be deterred any want to streak at a rugby match. I used to play rugby for many years so Iaposm a big fan and I just think it would be a laugh. Iaposm just concerned about how West Mercia Police might respond though.  Darrell, who lives with his we and two daughters, dropped his trousers at a mobile speed camera van on Stourbridge Road while his we went to a nearby Tesco Express. He was gobsmacked when police showed up  minutes later and arrested him in his back garden. Mobile phone footage filmed by Sarah, a nurse, shows Darrell calmly telling officers: Iaposm terminally ill, I wonapost be able to breathe like this. This is ridiculous - I moonied a speed camera. I moonied a speed camera. A West Mercia Police spokesman said on Tuesday : Around pm on Friday  November officers received a report of indecent exposure on Stourbridge Road. Officers attended and after a search of the area, located a person of interest in Coiey Close. A -year-old man from Kidderminster was arrested on suspicion of public order offences and released on bail.

Becky Aspinall, was diagnosed with Huntingtonaposs Disease  years ago when while pregnant with her son Alfie. The condition stops parts of the brain working properly over time, and Becky has deteriorated over the years and is now receiving palliative care.Because she didnapost know how long Becky had to live, her mum Lisa wanted to bring Christmas forward to celebrate one last festive season together, the Liverpool Echo reports.Lisa booked a trip away to Centre Parcs for Winter Wonderland, but her daughter became too ill and now Lisa wants to bring Wonderland to her - with the help from the local community.  The family is looking for old Christmas lights and decorations this week, so by Saturday they can transform their front garden for Becky and Alfie. Kirsty Smith, Beckyaposs best friend, said: Since she was diagnosed, sheaposs just deteriorated over the years. She was in a care home for eight years and because of Covid we had to visit her through the window which was hard, but planning permission was granted and her mum got an extension built so she came home on Christmas Eve. We were so happy when we got her home, we knew she was in the later stages of Huntingtonaposs disease and over the last year sheaposs gotten worse. She canapost walk or talk and recently she lost her ability to swallow. She made the advanced decision she didnapost want a Peg Feeding tube which means sheaposs now at end of le. Her mum Lisa booked Winter Wonderland but sheaposs too sick. Evenshe makes it that long, sheaposs likely to be unconscious by that point. Obviously you canapost put a time on it. So her mum decided to bring Christmas to her front garden. We would like it done by this Saturday because we donapost know how long she will remain conscious. The palliative care team want to up her medication so she will become less and less alert so it is pretty urgent. Beckyaposs family are not asking for cash donations, but instead have set up an Amazon Wish List.Kirsty is hoping to have donations within the next -hours to allow preparations to begin because of Beckyaposs health deterioration. She added: We want to wheel Becky out there with Alfie so they can enjoy a Christmas together. Last Christmas she came home but they couldnapost get her into a routine so it was hard for them, thataposs why this year they wanted to go away but unfortunately, Becky became too unwell. This is her mumaposs wishes so they can spend a Christmas together as a family because Alfie has never really had a Christmas with his mum. Iaposve known Becky since school and Iaposm a nurse now, itaposs sad to think we live completely dferent lives and she hasnapost had the same type of le. We are really grateful to everyone over the years. Weaposve had ious charity events and Becky has done lots of things thanks to people in the community helping. This is one final push for help.

The date for putting Christmas trees up is often hotly debated, with a range of Mumsnet users recently saying doing it early is tacky and vulgar. Meanwhile, in Scotland, a fully-decorated Christmas tree was spotted with twinkling lights in September.When it comes to real Christmas trees, people are often stumped about when to buy one in order for festivities to begin, while also making sure it lasts until the big day.But not this year, because the team at Flowercard have revealed exactly when the right time to buy is to ensure it stays in tip top condition throughout the festivities.When should you buy your real Christmas tree and how long do they last  According to experts, the best time to buy a real Christmas tree is at the end of November, ideally November , for those who wait until January  to take the tree down. Flowercard chief Liam Lapping said: “The day you buy your Christmas tree is one of the most important decisionsyou want to make sure it’s still intact throughout the festive season. The date you buy your tree ies depending on when you tend to take your tree down, as some people do it shortly after Christmas, while others wait until the New Year. “If you take your Christmas tree down straight after New Years Eve then you should buy your tree on the th November. “However,you take your Christmas tree down on the Twelfth Night then you should buy your tree on the nd December. According to Liam, Christmas trees tend to last for up to six weeks, depending on how well they are looked after. When should Christmas Trees traditionally go up  Roman Catholic tradition states that trees shouldnapost go up until the afternoon of Christmas Eve. Liam adds: If you want to follow tradition, then the traditional date to put your Christmas tree up is the afternoon of Christmas Eve, however, we definitely think we need to get in the Christmas spirit before then! Doing things a little earlier than Christmas eve has certainly caught on these days, with a newer tradition of putting trees up at the beginning of advent now common.  The beginning of advent is often regarded as the fourth Sunday before Christmas, meaning that this year it will fall on November . However, many prefer to interpret this date dferently, putting it up on the first of the month, with some regarding it as bad luck for the tree to go up before December. Others take this tradition even further, believing it is bad luck for trees to go up earlier than  days before Christmas. The moral of the story  Get that tree up whenever you want, as long as you time it so that itaposll last until Christmas day. Top tips for looking after your tree Choose the best looking tree: Before you buy your favourite looking fir, make sure you give it a good shake -lots of needles fall off then it probably isnapost the best choice.Trim the trunk : Once youaposve got your new tree in the door, be sure to saw off around cm from the bottom to ensure that plenty of water can be absorbed through the bottom. If it isnapost freshly cut thereaposs a good chance sap will form, limiting the trees ability to take on water, shortening itaposs lespan.Perfect the positioning : When putting it up, make sure you keep it away from any heat sources like radiators and fireplaces as these will dry it out. Keep it out of any drafts too as it wonapost like the rapid temperature changes. Invest in a stand : A good stand will enable your tree to be watered properly.Keep it hydrated : Three pints of water a day is recommended to keep your tree hydrated and to stop sap from forming over the stump.Comment MORE ON Christmas treesChristmasChristmas Day\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Join the Secret Elves for celebration inspiration - and brilliant gt ideas and reviewsSpread the cheer!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

One former employee of one of the UK’s most popular supermarkets has lted the lid on what it’s really like to work in a food shop – and some things might surprise you.The unnamed woman, from South East England, worked in a supermarket for seven years until she left in , and The Sun reports she “enjoyed it” overall.And while she may have made some lelong friends in her co-workers, the woman insisted parts of the job were far from glamorous.

The woman said she worked in ious departments within the store and was also a first aider – which she thought would be a “noble thing” to do until she discovered the truth. She said: “I was a first aider which I thought would be a noble thing to do! However working in a student town, came with student drinking. “This meant I was a gloried sick cleanerI even had a student be sick on me while I fetched him a sick bucket. That would be by far the grossest thing.” The woman also warned customers to always avoid using the toilets at a supermarket, as even the staff-only ones are lacking in the cleanliness department.  And when she wasn’t cleaning up other people’s bodily fluids, the woman spent much of her time being horried at just how much food gets thrown away at the end of each day. The woman claimed it was “gross” to see the food getting binned, and even though she “fought hard” to try and get her managers to give the excess to the homeless, she was always told that it would raise too many “legal dficulties”. She added: “It is quite gross how much gets thrown away though, especially bakery goods. At the end of the night everything gets binned. “When I worked there, I fought to try and get it sent to the homeless, but it came with a bunch of legal dficulties - although I think this might have changed now!” The former employee also had some helpful tips to share with customers, as she said the best times to shop are am - am, am, or pm. She also encouraged customers to “be nice” to supermarket workers, because they can often find themselves becoming a joke amongst staffthey’re rude. The woman even lted the lid on what happens when a supermarket shuts for the night – and it involves the staff playing Supermarket Sweep! She said: “We also held an initiative to improve staff morale called ‘fun at work’. This would involve ious activities that would just give a  min boost of fun to the day.“Being on night shts, there are no customers around, so our fun at work included aisle races and supermarket sweeps.

The biography, which was released in August  and details Harry and Meghanaposs married le and their split from the Royal Family, was supposedly unauthorised. But the Court of Appeal heard on Wednesday that a former aide to the couple did have some communication with the bookaposs authors.Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror.A statement written by Jason Knauf, who worked as a communications secretary to Meghan and Harry until March , informed the hearing that there had been contact with authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand. In response, Meghan conceded in her witness statement: In light of the information and documents that Mr Knauf has provided I accept that Mr Knauf did provide some information to the authors of the book and that he did so with my knowledge, for a meeting that he planned for with the authors in his capacity as Communications Secretary. The extent of the information he shared is unknown to me.  A previous statement from the couple regarding the book, which was not heard in court on Wednesday, said: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not interviewed and did not contribute to Finding Freedom. This book is based on the authorsapos own experiences as members of the royal press corps and their own independent reporting. The bombshell claims emerged as part of an appeal by the publisher of the Mail On Sunday, who maintain that the publication of a letter written by Meghan to her father, Thomas Markle, was lawful. Meghan won a case earlier this year after Lord Justice Warby ruled that Associated Newspapers Limitedaposs publication of her letter to her father was manestly excessive and hence unlawful in a summary judgment - avoiding the need for a trial. The publisheraposs appeal is being heard by Sir Geoffrey Vos, Dame Victoria Sharp and Lord Justice Bean over three days, and the judges are expected to give their ruling at a later date.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Kensington PalaceMail on SundayMeghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jason Knauf, who was communications secretary to Meghan and Harry until March , said the duchess had indicated to him in August of the previous year that she recognised it was possible that her father, Thomas Markle, would make the letter public.Mr Knauf said in his written evidence: She also asked a specic question regarding addressing Mr Markle as aposdaddyapos in the letter, saying aposgiven Iaposve only ever called him daddy it may make sense to open as such , and in the unfortunate event that it leaked it would pull at the heartstringsapos. Mr Knauf said Meghan had deliberately ended each page part way through a sentence so that no page could be ly presented as the end of the letter.  In the event that it was leaked she wanted the full narrative as set out in the letter to be understood and shared, he continued. He added: She said she felt aposfantasticapos after writing it and added that aposAndhe leaks it then thataposs on his consciousbut at least the world will know the truth. Words I could never voice publiclyapos. Mr Knaufaposs explosive new evidence was revealed on Wednesday during the second day of an appeal by the publisher of the Mail On Sunday against a High Court judgeaposs decision that the publication of the letter was unlawful. Lawyers for Associated Newspapers Limitedtold senior judges on Tuesday that they want to rely on a recent witness statement made by Mr Knauf in their legal bid to overturn the ruling. In his statement, Mr Knauf said the duchess had lost confidence that the privacy of her communication with her father would be respected by him as a result of his increasing co-operation with reporters and photographers.  He said that, in a series of text messages sent to him by Meghan, she had written that the catalyst for writing the letter to Mr Markle, , was seeing how much pain this is causing H. Mr Knauf also said the duchess told him she was writing the letter in part to allow the duke to demonstrate to his family that some action was being taken by the couple to stop Mr Markle from continuing to engage with the media. He said the texts included an early draft of the letter and that Meghan had written: Obviously everything I have drafted is with the understanding that it could be leaked so I have been meticulous in my word choice, but please do let me knowanything stands out for you as a liability. He added: On the specic issue of the letter, the duchess indicated in messages to me that she recognised that it was possible that Mr Markle would make the letter public. She wanted to write a letter rather than an email or text message - other options she had considered and discussed with senior Royal Household staff - as a letter could not be forwarded or cut and pasted to only share one small portion.  As part of a series of messages on  August , she explained that she had given careful thought to how to prevent the letter being leaked in part or in a misleading way. In the event that it was leaked she wanted the full narrative as set out in the letter to be understood and shared. She said she had apostoiled over every detail which could be manipulatedapos. Andrew Caldecott QC, representing ANL, told the Court of Appeal: The picture presented to the judge on behalf of the claimant ... was that this was an entirely private letter crafted for Mr Markleaposs eyes only. The barrister said the High Court judge had clearly taken this into account during his ruling on privacy. He later added: The position we now have is a dferent position and a more nuanced one, that the letter was written and crafted with readership in mind, and indeed she was happy for the public to read itMr Markle were to leak it. Meghanaposs lawyers are opposing the appeal and ANLaposs bid for the Court of Appeal to take Mr Knaufaposs evidence into consideration as part of the challenge, and the duchess has provided her own statement in response. In it, she said she had decided to write the letter after discussions with unnamed senior members of the royal family, which Mr Knauf was not privy to. She said she did not think her father would leak the letter, as it would show him in a bad light. Rebutting Mr Knaufaposs evidence, she said: The proposition that saying that I recognised that it was possible that my father would leak the letter, albeit unlikely, is the same as saying that I thought it likely that he would do so is, I would suggest, absurd. Meghan also said she was eager to please the royal family and was especially sensitive to their concerns about her fatheraposs public attacks on them. She added: It is correct that, as I said in my texts to Mr Knauf, the situation was putting signicant pressure on my husband, both externally and by his family, and I felt strongly that I needed to do something about it. I felt that, evenmy attempt to stop my father talking to the media failed, at least my husband would be able to say to his family that I had done everything I could to stop it. The duchess also said the letter was the only viable option for communicating with her father, which would not have been the case before the media intrusion into their relationship.  The statements were disclosed to the press following representations to the court by the PA news agency. Meghan, , sued ANL, which is also the publisher of MailOnline, over a series of articles which reproduced parts of a personal and private letter to Mr Markle in August . She claimed the five articles, published in print and online in February , misused her private information, infringed herand breached the Data Protection Act. She won her case earlier this year after Lord Justice Warby ruled that ANLaposs publication of her letter to her father was manestly excessive and hence unlawful in a summary judgment - avoiding the need for a trial. In March, the publisher was ordered to print a statement on the front page of the Mail On Sunday and a notice on page three of the paper stating it infringed herby publishing parts of the letter to Mr Markle. But the front-page statement about Meghanaposs victory has not yet been published as it is on hold pending the outcome of the appeal. The judge concluded he could make the rulings without the need for a full trial of the issues involved. The publisheraposs appeal is being heard by Sir Geoffrey Vos, Dame Victoria Sharp and Lord Justice Bean over three days, and the judges are expected to give their ruling at a later date.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Meghan Markle\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The couple’s former communications secretary Jason Knauf alleges Harry and Meghan authorised “specic co-operation” on certain topics with Finding Freedom authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand.The biography, published in August , detailed the married lives of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - and their infamous split from the Royal Family.The book was described as an unauthorised biography, and the royal couple have previously said they were not interviewed and did not contribute to Finding Freedom. However within the book, the authors said they did speak to the couple when appropriate.In a witness statement to the Court of Appeal today, Knauf says he met with both authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand in December .  In his statement, Knauf said: “I also told him [Harry] that I would meet the authors that week to help with aposfactual accuracy and context’. “The Duke replied the same day saying: apos…I totally agree that we have to be able to say we didn’t have anything to do with it. Equally, you giving the right context and background to them would help get some truths out there. “The truth is v much needed and would be appreciated, especially around the Markle wedding stuff but at the same time we can’t put them directly in touch with her friends.” The court also heard Harry contacted Knauf asking: “are u planning on giving them a rough idea of what she’s been through over the last yrs   “Media onslaught, cyber bullying on a dferent scale, puppeteering Thomas Markle etc etc etc. “Eventhey choose not to use it, they should hear what it was like from someone who was in the thick of it. “Soyou aren’t planning on telling them, can I  !” Among the subjects that Knauf says he was asked to address with the authors was the planning of their wedding and their charity work. At the time of publication, Meghan and Harryaposs team released a statement reading: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not interviewed and did not contribute to Finding Freedom. This book is based on the authorsapos own experiences as members of the royal press corps and their own independent reporting. Writing in the authorsapos section of the book, Scobie and Durand say: We have spoken with close friends of Harry and Meghan, royal aides and palace staff , the charities and organisations they have built long-lasting relationships with and, when appropriate, the couple themselves.  In many instances, we have granted sources anonymity to allow freedom to candidly provide direct quotes without their names being attributed .Knaufaposs statement comes after the Court of Appeal earlier heard Meghan’s letter to her estranged fatherThomas Marklewas written with public consumption in mind as a possibility.Lawyers for the Mail On Sundayaposs publisher told senior judges they want to rely on new evidence from Knauf, which suggests Meghan suspected her father may disclose the letter to the media. The newspaperaposs publisher, Associated Newspapers Limited , began its appeal on Tuesday against a High Court judgeaposs decision that the publication of the letter was unlawful. Meghan, , sued ANL, which is also the publisher of MailOnline, over a series of articles which reproduced parts of a personal and private letter to Mr Markle, , in August . She claimed the five articles, published in print and online in February , misused her private information, infringed herand breached the Data Protection Act. Meghan won her case earlier this year after Lord Justice Warby ruled that ANLaposs publication of Meghanaposs letter to her father was manestly excessive and hence unlawful in a summary judgment - avoiding the need for a trial. However, at the outset of ANLaposs challenge, due to be heard over three days, Andrew Caldecott QC, representing the publisher, said Mr Knaufaposs evidence casts doubt on the basis of the judgeaposs ruling. The publisheraposs appeal is being heard by Sir Geoffrey Vos, Dame Victoria Sharp and Lord Justice Bean over three days, and the judges are expected to give their ruling at a later date.

Yesterday, Meghan gave a wide-ranging interview - her first in-person since her bombshell chat with Oprah Winfrey - when she appeared at an online summit hosted by the New York Times.In it, she talked about social media, stepping back from the royal family, and her recent calls for paid leave to be made available to those in the US. In the chat, host Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Meghan why she wanted to lobby senators on the issue of paid leave after making several calls and sending an open letter to Congress.  He said: Iaposm sure there are people in the audience who are saying, aposI donapost understand - she has this great privilege, why is this her topic apos And Meghan replied: Youaposve mentioned privilege. My husband always says, aposWith great privilege comes great responsibilityapos. But even before I had any privilege in my le, when my le and my lestyle were very, very dferent, I always just stood up for what was right.

And Harryaposs quote on privilege almost mirrors one made famous by Spider-Man, who is known for saying: With great power comes great responsibility.Elsewhere in the chat, Meghan also addressed accusations she has used her royal title to call for paid maternity leave, by introducing herself as the Duchess of Sussex when cold-calling senators to lobby them.She said: I donapost see this as a political issue frankly. There is a precedent among my husbandaposs family, the royal family, of not having any involvement in politics. From my standpoint, this is a humanitarian issue. My husband has always said with great privilege comes great responsibility and before I had any kind of privilege, I always stood up for what was right. Iaposve been gone from the US for a really long time, I was in Canada for seven years then I went to the UK. Iaposve come back and Iaposm a mother of two.  She added that lawmakers were often apossurprisedapos to hear from her but were receptive. She said: I still see myself as the same as I have always been. Iaposve always been a hard worker, people that know me well some of whom are here today know that, Iaposve just always been the same. Meghan, who sported an all-black outfit, wore a Remembrance poppy as she was questioned at the summit.She also spoke about social media and highlighted the fact that Instagram has a like button and ability to comment, but not a aposdislikeapos option. As a consequence, people either express their approval by hitting aposlikeapos, or explain their negative feelings in the comments. A aposdislikeapos button would lead to less negative, angry comments, Meghan said. Her appearance at the summit came on the same day Harry spoke at an event on misinformation on the internet hosted by Wired magazine.In it he slammed the term Megxit as misogynistic and called misinformation online a global humanitarian crisis.He also said that he and Meghan would not set up new social media accounts until tech firms take action against internet trolls.

However, the mum-of-two claims things have soured after allegations of antisocial behaviour by neighbours. Michele parked her Mercedes in a private car park, which prompted locals to leave notes and dog poo, she has claimed. She further claimed they objected to her wanting a closed public toilet to re-open as well as where she parked her car because they were “jealous of her”.  Michele claims that last month, Worthing Borough Council stepped in and removed her hut and changed the locks. The council said it was the first seafront eviction in  years. Michele said: “I went to the beach hut one morning a few weeks ago and the locks were changed - then it was removed without my knowledge. I am just a beach hut owner quietly enjoying the area because itaposs good for my mental health - but neighbours started bullying me and conspiring against me. I donapost think there is anything wrong with my parking - and I only tried to get a toilet re-opened. I did nothing but good for the community - but theyaposre jealous of me because Iaposm glamorous. It feels like this has ruined my le - Iaposve lost my beloved beach hut. Michele bought the beach hut in April  to create a haven for herself and her mental health following her orce. She said she spent months renovating it and claims it is now worth £,. She said abusive notes were left on her car windscreen following her campaign to have a toilet re-opened near to the row of beach huts. Residents of a nearby development have to pay a service charge for the upkeep of the toilet, despite it being on council-owned land. She claims they rejected her request to re-open the toilet. Michele also says she was left notes on her car that called her an idiot and told her she was p***ing residents off, although she claims she is entitled to park where she did. She said: I didnapost do anything wrong - but because I model and I have a nice car, they have a certain impression of me. Her neighbours eventually reported her to Worthing Borough Council for antisocial behaviour, she claims. And when she went to visit the hut on October , she found the locks had been changed before it was later removed from its spot entirely, she said. She says it had been moved to the front of the sailing club - with all her belongings still inside. She said: I had a full breakdown on the beach when I couldnapost find it.  When I did, I found it had been damaged beyond repair and all my belongings were still inside. My pride and joy were taken without me even knowing about it. She said she camped for several days near the beach hut because she was scared of it being taken away again. Michele said she wants it moved to her garden in Worthing and wonapost give up until she gets justice, and sheaposs taking legal action against the council.  Michele said: Honestly itaposs ruined my le - Iaposve experienced a hell of a lot of stress. Iaposm just a normal beach hut owner - I come to the beach for a walk for my mental health and Iaposm sociable with the other owners. Iaposve done nothing wrong - itaposs a conspiracy against me to get me removed. I think itaposs because theyaposre jealous of me because Iaposm a model and Iaposm very glamorous with a sports car. But all Iaposve done is be a good resident and try to stand up for people. I wanted the hut to improve my mental health but itaposs just been  months of total misery. The hut is my le and my little haven - and I just want it back where it belongs. A spokesperson for Worthing Borough Council said: We are sorry it has come to this but for the first time in about  years we have had to take eviction action at one of our beach huts. The number of complaints received from local residents really left us with no choice but to conclude that Mrs Spicer has breached the terms of her lease.

She explained: “I feel like I should clary that I was in high school when this happened so I was directly impacted by my dad leaving.“He went from living with us and being a regular part of my le to barely speaking with me because his new we wanted him to forget his first family.”The woman said that he also failed to pay child support because his new we didn’t want him to spend money on them.She continued: “I have zero interactions with his second we.

I have nothing against them, but I feel nothing for them beyond a general desire to make sure they aren’t in danger.“If they needed my help financially, I would help out, but I really don’t want to be in their lives regularly. It drags up all sorts of negative feelings from my past that I’ve struggled to overcome.”She concluded: “So, AITA for basically ignoring two innocent kids who recently lost their dad and just want their sister to love them  Because I sure do feel like one.”Here is an AITA key for reference: Youaposre the a** hole YTAYouaposre Not the a** hole NTA Everyone sucks here  ESH No a** holes here  NAHIt would seem that the most common response amongst Reddit users was NAH, which stands for “no a** holes here.”One Reddit user responded to the thread: “Iaposm not sure how to vote on this one, but Iaposm going to say NAH.“You have entirely valid feelings, but so do they.

Photographs posted on social media on Wednesday showed y lines at Heathrow, Luton and Stansted. It is the third time the eGates - which were first implemented in  - have gone down in as many months. The Home Office, which manages the self-service barriers, apologised to all travellers who had been affected. But the problem has still drawn the ire of some passengers, who took to social media. One described the situation at Heathrow as a complete shower, and added that there did not appear to be staff around to help.Have you been affected by the issue  Email webnews@mirror.Another, Bloomberg reporter Sid Philip, said: Another day, another outage at Heathrow.  hours from plane to outside the terminal and I was lucky!

But these titles arenapost always kept forever - they can be ever-changing as they navigate royal le. For example, Lady Louise Windsor who turned  yesterday, does not use an HRH or princess title - even though she is entitled to. But now sheaposs an adult, she could well decide to adopt these stylesshe wants to. And sheaposs not the only royal who could see their titles change in the future. We take a look.... Prince WilliamOn his wedding day in , Prince William was granted the title of Duke of Cambridge. But once his father Prince Charles ascends to the throne, he will be known as something  as well.Thataposs because he will inherit Charlesaposs current title Prince of Wales - which is reserved for the male heir to the throne.Not only that, he will also become the Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay when in Scotland and Earl of Chester.Kate Middleton  Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. The Duchess of Cambridge was also granted her grand title on her wedding day - the same as her husband Prince William.And when his titles change when Charles becomes King - so will hers.As William will become Prince of Wales, Kate will be entitled to be the Princess of Wales - a title previously held by her late mother-in-law Princess Diana.She will also take the female version of his other future titles, meaning she will also be Duchess of Cornwall, Duchess of Rothesay and Countess of Chester.And when William eventually ascends to the throne, she will become Queen consort, meaning she will probably become Queen Catherine - Catherine being her real first name.Prince George He may only be eight but Prince George is third in line to the throne and could see numerous title changes over his letime.His current title is Prince George of Cambridge but when his parents become Prince and Princess of Wales - he will then become known as Prince George of Wales. Then when his parents become King and Queen, as the male heir he would become Prince of Wales.Thataposs also not to mention the fact he will also be probably given a dukedom on his wedding dayhe chooses to marry.Princess Charlotte Like her big brother Prince George, Princess Charlotte is also set for some dramatic title changes.She too is known a Princess Charlotte of Cambridge but will change to become Princess Charlotte of Wales when her dad becomes Prince of Wales.Meanwhile, when William becomes King, he could choose to give her the title of Princess Royal, which is usually awarded to the oldest daughter of the monarch. However, as it is a title that remains for le, Charlotte could only be awarded it once the current Princess Royal, Princess Anne, passes away. Duchess of Cornwall There have long been reports that Prince Charles plans to mix things up and slim down the monarchy when he becomes King.And one way he could do this is by giving his we Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, an unprecedented title when he ascends the throne.Usually, the we of a King uses the title of Queen Consort and ever since they went public with their relationship there has been much discussion about the role his second we will take when the Queen passes away.But at the time of their marriage in , an official statement said it is intended that The Duchess will be known as HRH The Princess Consort”.This would make Camilla the first British royal to ever use the title of Princess Consort.Archie and Lilibet Prince Harry and Meghan Markleaposs young children Archie and Lilibet currently do not hold titles or the HRH style.But when their grandfather Prince Charles becomes King, they could well be entitled to them.A spokesperson for Debrettaposs told the Mirror: In , King George V ordered that only the grandchildren of the monarch would be entitled to use the style of prince or princess and HRH, the only exception to this order was that the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales would also be entitled to be use the style HRH and Prince.“In , the Queen issued new Letters Patent that the style of HRH and Prince Princess would be extended to all of Prince William’s children, not just his eldest son.“Archieaposs entitlement to use the style of Prince and HRH will come into force when his grandfather Prince Charles becomes King.”Prince Edward and Sophie WessexInstead of being made a duke, Prince Edward was made Earl of Wessex when he married his we Sophie in .However, he is set to eventually get the title of a duke - although it will be when his older brother Charles becomes King. And that the title will be Duke of Edinburgh.It was announced at the time of Edwardaposs wedding he would one day succeed his father as the Duke of Edinburgh with the blessing of the late Prince Philip and the Queen.Sophie, currently the Countess of Wessex, will eventually become the Duchess of Edinburgh - a courtesy title which was held by the Queen - when that happens.Comment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeLady Louise WindsorPrince WilliamRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

According to Coventry Live, the strange fluorescent cloud, which was spotted by many in the Longford, Aldermans Green and Foleshill areas on Monday evening, had first appeared to be the work of aliens.Many, like local resident Martin Garry, had noticed the ghostly gleams while out walking. He said: I noticed it while walking the dog in the park. I thought it looked a bit strange. I was curious, being an amateur astronomer, so I grabbed a picture. He added: I hadn’t seen anything like it before for sure. I did have mixed thoughts as it was by the stadiumbut seemed a strange colour for the lights. So my thoughts went to a type of Northern Lights, which Iaposve not seen before. Who knows, maybe the Lord was shining on the mighty Sky Blues, passing on ine intervention for last-minute goals and their journey to the promised land!  But Adele Walsh, who was at the Arena Shopping Park, had noticed the lights and recognised the source appearing from the Coventry Building Society Arena. Adele said: I thought it looked quite spooky, but there was like drizzly rain too so the air was quite misty which made it look even brighter. However, Coventry Live has revealed the mysterious glow was in fact not the work of aliens, but the work of the grounds team at the arena. The articial sunlight used on the arena pitch help to grow and repair the pitch after it is played on. The lights were previously announced in a “joint investment” made by the club and rugby club Wasps in an “effort to keep the pitch healthy”. Chief executive of the Football, Dave Boddy said: “We are jointly investing in another set of growing lights which, as you can see are on the pitch now, so there will be a second set of lights in situ and it will be very much a collaborative situation where we work very closely together.” For now, it seems any visit from extraterrestrials in Coventry is unlikely - just yet.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON UFOs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In , she developed sepsis after going to the doctor with a cough.

Jayne was described as an amazing person by Robert at the inquest. He said: The brightest star in my sky has burnt out. In a statement to the inquest, he said she was happy, bubbly, sociable person who had a passion for travelling around the world when they first met. After her amputations, Mr Carpenter said his we put all her effort into regaining her le and she amazed us as a family. He said that, as a sepsis awareness advocate, her experiences were used to assist the education of medical students. But, in November , he noticed a sudden decline in Jaynes mental health and she began drinking more alcohol, he said. The inquest heard she twice took an overdose - and the restrictions of the coronavirus pandemic stopped her from enjoying the things that were important to her.On the day she died in December , tests showed she had drunk a large quantity of alcohol but police did not find a note stating her intention to take her own le.

The boxer labrador mix loves to howl at the ice-cream van before getting his own soft-served treat - and Katie Dixon wanted to hear him sing for ice-cream just one more time. The mum-of-two, from Staffordshire, received the heartbreaking news that Marley had cancer, and she would have to make the decision to put him to sleep in the coming weeks. Marley had been by her side for eight years - from sleeping on a friendaposs sofa, to helping her through dficult times. Katie said: “Marley was born on July , . I didnapost want a dog initially as I was living with two friends at the time, sleeping on their sofa. “But I went to see my other friend and her dogs had just had puppies. All the other pups came running over to me straight away but Marley sat up in his bed yawned and fell out of the bed, he strolled over to me slowly and lay down on my feet. I just knew from that moment that I had to have him.” The -year-old credited her ‘boxador’ for helping her through challenging times.If youaposre grieving a dog whoaposs crossed the Rainbow Bridge, leave them a tribute on TeamDogs . She added: “Marley has been my strength when I didnapost even have any. He is the best present Iaposve ever had. He’s been through all my dficult times with me and he’s truly my best friend. “It might sound silly but Iaposve told that pooch things that Iaposll take to my grave. He’s as loyal as they come. Iaposm going to be so lost without him.” Last month, Katie noticed a lump in Marley’s mouth and rushed him to the vets where they treated him for an abscess. But after two weeks, the eight-year-old dog was no better, and ed to the practice where Katie was told her dog had a tumour.  He underwent an operation to remove as much as they could, but  days later, the fast-growing tumour had ed. Katie added: “He hasnapost been himself since Saturday - he’s really lethargic and not wanting to eat or drink. I took him back to the vets again and they said the tumour is already back and thereaposs nothing more that can be done for him. “The tumour is fast growing and seems to be taking its toll quickly. Iaposll have to make a decision soon as heaposs in pain and chewing his fur off his tail.”One of Katie’s favourite things about Marley is how he howls at the jingle of an ice cream van, and she took to Facebook to seeanyone would be able to drive by their home to give him one last cone.

Staffordshire ice cream man Jeff Condlfe took the time to go off-route to visit Marley and give him a special treat. In an emotional video, Marley hears the tune to the van and puts his paws on his garden gate to give out a melodic howl. Katie leads him over to the van where Marley puts his paws up to the counter to take an ice cream from Jeff. The boxador enjoyed not one, but four ice-cream cones surrounded by family and friends who were holding back tears. Katie said: “Thank you so much to Jeff for letting me hear that howl one last time and thank you for making my pooch a very happy boy. Marl enjoyed it with a few family and friends there to watch him.

While parts of the country have been hit with showers, floods and gales over the past couple of weeks, temperatures have remained mild. It even reached an unseasonal C in Flintshire, North Wales, on Monday.But after more wind and rain from the remnants of Tropical Storm Wanda, the Met Office has said that freezing temperatures and snowfall are around the corner - starting on Sunday, November .Bookies have slashed the odds on this being the coldest November ever, from - to just -. Weather maps are showing that the risk of snow will grow next week. On Wednesday, November , there is a high possibility of snow in Scotland and then over the following day it is likely to hit the North East of England. Then the risk of snow grows down the eastern side of the UK before the map on Saturday, November  suggests most of the UK will have a very high chance of snow. The worst affected will be Scotland, northern England and the Midlands. Temperatures will have noseed to as low as -C in parts of Scotland and could be around -C in southern England on Thursday, November . It is predicted to get even colder going down to -C in southern England and -C in northern Scotland in the early hours of Sunday, November . We are headed for a big November freeze, said Coralaposs Harry Aitkenhead Itaposs left us with no choice but to signicantly slash the odds on this month entering the record books as the coldest eleventh month of the year the UK has ever seen. The Met Office said that there is likely to be a drop in temperatures at the start of next week and then again at the end of the month. It stated: “Remaining changeable and autumnal particularly to the north through the start of this period as low-pressure systems dominate, sometimes accompanied by rain and strong winds. Elsewhere while rain is possible at times, drier and brighter conditions are more likely in the south and southeast regions, although some rain will likely reach even here at times. A rather cold start to the period will likely be followed by a brief recovery in temperatures, before a further likely trend down later on in the month. Later on in the month there will also be an increasing chance of some wintry conditions, mainly over the higher ground in the north, but with a slight risk to lower levels.  Today: A few bright spells in south-east England,  central and southern areas cloudy with outbreaks of rain and drizzle and a good deal of hill fog. Northern areas having sunny spells and some showers, most in the far north. Tonight: Low cloud, mist and fog across central and southern areas with some drizzle. Clear periods further north with patchy frost and fog, but heavy showers and gales in far north. Thursday: Low cloud lting slowly, with some fog persisting until early afternoon over eastern England, then sunny spells. Showers in the north, then rain and strong winds into the northwest later. Outlook for Friday to Sunday: Breezy with outbreaks of rain on Friday, heaviest in the northwest. Over the weekend, cloudy in the east with some drizzle, brighter in the west. Mild, turning colder later.

So how do we stop Google from collecting our data  Google maps - tracking your whereabouts  Google stores the exact coordinates of where you have been on the commonly used Google Maps app. It can be a useful feature of the app in that it stores your previous trips, reminding you of where you were at one time and how you got there. But you can work against this optionyou wish to. You can stop Google Maps using your GPS location, as well as turning off your location history Make Use Of explains: The Web and App Activity switch, however, is the most critical one here.

Business Insider said: There is an important exception: In the Location History settings, you can click Devices on this account to see all the phones and tablets being tracked. You can choose to uncheck any of those devices to stop Google from tracking it. Make sure to take notice of other features on your Google account too like the aposAd personalizationapos section, which can be turned off.

Lloyd - a former director of consumer group Which  - alleged that Google gathered information on iPhone users who used the web browser and used it for advertising purposes.  The data consisted of information on peopleaposs health, race, ethnicity, sexuality and political affiliations. Google has insisted that no information was shared to third parties. The company said the data collection was accidental and the Supreme Court unanimously agreed that compensation was not owed as it was not clear that all of the iniduals suffered any material damage or distress.

Sian Moss, , was diagnosed with aggressive triple negative breast cancer just one week before her birthday in May this year. The teacher was working in the UAE, and Covid flight restrictions meant none of her family could be with her when she started chemotherapy, as Dubai was on the UK’s red list. And after the cancer treatment began to make poor Sian’s hair fall out, she was left feeling like she “couldn’t be bothered with it anymore” – until her best friend swooped in to give her a much-needed pick-me-up. Amanda Cope, , flew thousands of miles to Dubai on her own to surprise Sian as she walked out of her penultimate chemo appointment, and the shock of seeing her pal almost caused Sian to faint. In a clip posted on TikTok, Sian is seen walking out of the hospital with a huge smile on her face, before freezing and spotting her long-distance pal. The video, which has since racked up more than , views and , likes, shows the pair running into each otheraposs arms and laughing, as the shocked Sian tries not to pass out. Sian, from Ipswich, said: Amandaaposs surprise came at the best time. Iaposd had a really tough week. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Iaposd been using the cold cap to try and save my hair, but in the last week, because of the amount of chemo, my hair had been falling out and Iaposd been having really bad bone pain. That morning I woke up and thought aposI just canapost be bothered with this anymoreapos. I was in such a flat mood so when I came out and saw her, I almost fainted. I just couldnapost believe she was there. There was so much emotion. I felt instantly better. It was amazing. Sian found a lump in her right breast after a workout this year and decided to get herself checked out despite not feeling ill. And the woman says it was probably the best decision she could have made, because she managed to catch her cancer early. She added: I only found the lump back in April. It was completely by accident. By this point, the UAE was on the UKaposs red list so I didnapost really have an option to get home. I just decided to do all my treatment here. “Itaposs all gone well so far. I was very lucky because I managed to catch it at stage one and it hadnapost gone into a lymph node.  With the situation, I tell myself how lucky I am that I did get it checked and got it sorted so soon. It could have a completely dferent story within six months to a year. Sian met Amanda three years ago when they were both working in Dubai, but Amanda was made redundant during the pandemic and moved back to the UK. And when she heard about Sian’s cancer diagnosis, the woman – who now works in marketing – was keen to go back to Dubai to support her friend. She said: Sian had been going through cancer on her own so I thoughtthere was one thing I could do, it was surprise her. It worked out great and at one point, we thought she was going to pass out. I was like aposOh no, weaposve wiped her outapos, but she was fine. She was absolutely buzzing.” The pair’s TikTok video has received a wholly positive reception, and people have been sending their well wishes to Sian. Amanda added: Everyoneaposs full of well wishes for Sian and a few people have messaged her wanting to talk to her. Weaposve had loads of comments on both videos now. I think people just love a nice positive story.Have you got a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The “friend” who thinks knowing us insulates them from the charge of racism when they are being just that. Ex-England cricketer Gary Ballance admitted in a statement last week he’d called Yorkshire teammate, Azeem Rafiq, a “P***” – but said it was done “in the spirit of friendly banter” . Ballance has come clean because, in August , Rafiq gave an interview in which he spoke about the racism he experienced at Yorkshire, including an “openly racist” captain and a dressing room in which racist comments were seen as humorous. The club effectively stuck its head in the sand, but an independent report has blown the whole thing wide open. Sponsors have withdrawn their cash, chairman Roger Hutton has resigned and English cricket’s most successful county has been banned from hosting internationals.  But back to Ballance. He claims to be incredulous that calling an Asian person the P-word could cause the kind of hurt and anguish it did to Rafiq. “If I’d believed it, I would have stopped immediately,” said Ballance. “He was my best cricket mate and I cared deeply for him.” Just not enough to stop using this horrendous racist slur against him. It is easy to believe this is a story just about Yorkshire, cricket or even sport. It isn’t. Go into any office, factory, shop floor or football club you like and you’ll find at least one dinosaur convinced that racist abuse can be used as a term of affection. ‘Can a racist term ever be defined as banter ’ trilled the Twitter account of the BBC’s Question Time. Yes, really. It may as well have asked whether slapping your partner is ever justied. Or whether political corruption is ever justiedthe money is for a good cause.  If ever we needed a snapshot of the institutional racism that infects this country to its core, the past week has provided it. Ironically, there is more outrage and anger directed at those who call it out - as Rafiq has found to his cost - than at the issue itself. Yet the fact remains, across any number of industries and sports, iniduals like him iniably find themselves one of the only Black or Asian people in the room at the mercy of the bigots. Across the country you’ll find iniduals pulling the emergency ripcord defence that their workmate, best friend, neighbour, partner, even husband or we is black. Asthat allows them a free pass to use the kind of language or go down the routes that would otherwise see them vilied. The Government does it even now. Prime Minister Boris Johnson surrounds himself with gatekeepers such as Kwasi Kwarteng, Kemi Badenoch and Priti Patel, believing it protects him from stick for describing Burqa-wearing women as looking like letterboxes. Or describing black people as ‘picaninnies’. Question Time is no exception. Presumably pointing to whatever black or Asian members it has on its production team. And no, it is no defence that the offensive question tweeted was one posed by an audience member to spark debate. Rafiq’s forthcoming appearance in front of a parliamentary select committee may well bring the rest of Yorkshire’s house of cards down. But the shock waves are already reverberating way beyond cricket. PS: You’re not someone’s friendyou’re using racist language towards them.

Here’s what you need to know about the Poppy AppealPoppies are worn as a sign of respect to honour lives lost to war Image: Getty ImagesByMalvika Padin:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsEvery year when November comes around, you’re sure to see many people across the country wearing a poppy on their lapel.The poppy is a symbol of Remembrance Day which falls on November , marking the end of the First World War . Taking its origin from the  poem In Flanders Fields by Canadian officer John McCrae and later adopted as a signicant symbol of the Royal British Legion, the poppy is worn not only during Remembrance but at the funerals of veterans or even other events like memorial services or anniversaries. Worn with respect on the left side over the heart, the symbolic flower should not be affixed with any pin that obstructs the Poppy.When do you stop wearing a poppy   Typically the Poppy Appeal lasts from end of October – starting on Thursday, October  this year- till Remembrance Day on November . The poppies can be worn throughout this period but also on the evening after the Remembrance Day Ceremony. While some people choose to remove their Poppy at the end of the day on November , others remove it after the ceremony and place their poppy on the cenotaph or on a wreath as a sign of respect. How to remove and store your poppy  When a Poppy is removed, it should either be stored appropriately or disposed of respectfully. If you find a poppy that’s fallen on the ground, pick it up, brush it off so that it can be kept or disposed of. Where to buy a poppy for Remembrance Day   You can buy paper poppies from collectors on high streets, supermarkets and transport hubs. The flowers are also available for purchase online, not just in simple paper form but as badges, pins, wreaths and even alcoholic drinks. Last year, due to the pandemic, the Legion couldn’t send out volunteers to sell poppies on the street. So, people were encouraged to donate using QR codes, contactless methods and via online s. This year the collectors are back, but the alternative methods of donation are still available.

Helena gave fans on TikTok a tour of the miniscule property earlier this year, and showed off the master bedroom – which only just fits in a double bed – and the kitchen, which doesn’t have a full range of cooking appliances. In a separate video addressing the lack of appliances, Helena, from New Jersey, USA, said: We eat with his parents every night down at their house but up here we have a hot plate, toaster oven and microwave. The couple’s daughters share a small room which just about fits their two beds, and even though extra storage space has been created by using shelves above their beds, people still accuse Helena of forcing her kids to sleep in a wardrobe. When one viewer called her selfish for her kids’ sleeping arrangements, Helena replied: A lot of people have been concerned and wondering why we get the aposbig room’, and the kids get the aposclosetapos. “Itaposs not a closet, it was added on just for them and it fits both of their beds perfectly.

Youaposve got to work here with what youaposve got. Okay   Helena also insisted the tiny home is not her family’s forever home, and they plan on finding a bigger place as soon as they can. And while the two young girls “fight like normal siblings would” from time to time, they have no problems sharing a room. Helena insisted: They take comfort in sleeping near each other.

Jordan Turpin was  when she broke free and made desperate phone call to police, explaining how her parents David and Louise Turpin beat, starved, and shackled the children to their beds at the home in Calornia. When officers responded to her desperate call for help, they initially thought Jordan was only  as she was so emaciated from years of being underfed. Now speaking out for the first time, Jordan ABC: My whole body was shaking. I couldnapost really dial . I think it was us coming so close to death so many times.  It was literally a now or never. If something happened to me, at least I died trying. The sisteraposs interview - which marks the first time any of the children have been identied - includes previously unseen bodycam footage of the moment police raided the Turpin household. Her  call was previously released, with Jordan heard telling operators the children lived in filth and would only be allowed to bathe once a year.When Jordan climbed out of the window of the family home to alert the authorities to their hellish existence, the eldest of the Turpinaposs children was  years old.  When police arrived to investigate Jordanaposs  call claiming her  siblings had been kept captive and abused, they found the group so malnourished they did not at first realise some of the brothers and sisters were adults. Some of the siblings were found bound to their beds and furniture by chains and padlocks - telling police they were “starving.” Jordan said of the abuse: Mother, she choked me and I thought I was going to die. Her sister - who has remained unnamed in the episode preview - said: The only word I can think to call it is hell.  In , David and Louise Turpin were jailed for  years to le over  counts each of torture, dependent adult abuse, child endangerment and  imprisonment. David Turpin, , an engineer, and housewe Louise, , had managed to cover up their childrenaposs miserable living situation for years by home-schooling them, when in reality they were sometimes chaining them up for one to two months and only freeing them to brush their teeth or use the bathroom. A court heard details of how some of the children claimed to have not bathed in a year, how their parents would bake them food and bring them toys - but they were not allowed to touch them.  They were stopped from using the toilet. None had seen a dentist. Most had little to no schooling, and the -year-old who rang  didnapost know what medication was. They never ate breakfast and subsisted on a paltry diet with no breakfast, and aposmealsapos of peanut butter, bologna, a frozen burrito or chips for lunch and dinner. The police took the children into protective custody after they were found living in the horric conditions last January. The Turpins cried as their children addressed the courtroom before their parents were put behind bars. My parents took my whole le from me, now I’m taking my le back, one of the coupleaposs daughters said.  “Le may have been bad, but it made me strong. I saw my dad change my mum, they almost changed me. I’m a fighter. I’m strong.” An adult son said he still loves his parents, but recounted years of horric abuse. I cannot describe in words what me and my siblings went through, he said in a statement. Sometimes, I still have nightmares about what happened, like my sibling being chained up and beaten. I love my parents and have forgiven them for all of the things that they have done to us.  I have learned so much and become very independent. I live in an apartment and go to a nearby college. I am getting a bacheloraposs degree in software engineering, and after I get my bacheloraposs degree Iaposm going to get a job as a software engineer and go to school part-time to get my masteraposs degree.

The clip posted by@thegoodboyarchiefollows adorable puppy Ivy on her big day.In the dog equivalent of her first day at school, Ivy even brings her own packed lunch - a bag of kibble with her name on it. “I hope they like me,” the video caption reads as Ivy arrives at the care facility, Pampered Pets in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with her big brother Archie leading the way to the front door. Ivy seems uncertain about her destination at first - she scratches at the door as her owner leaves, before cuddling into fellow golden retriever Archie for comfort. But the confident pup soon leaves all her worries behind, as the next clip shows her lying sprawled out on her back in the middle of the yard as the other dogs snf around her. “This is so much fun!” the video caption reads as the pup bounds around the yard, enjoying playtime with her new friends and even having a dip in a paddling pool.This week our sister site TeamDogs is hosting its first ever Hero Dogs Week, supported by Everypaw Pet Insurance.Aiming to shine a light on the UK’s incredible furry friends, this week-long celebration will spotlight the everyday heroes who’ve gone above and beyond to help their humans – but we need your help finding them. So, whether your pup is an emotional support animal who supports your mental health on a daily basis, therapy dog who brings joy to hospital patients, or just a bundle of love and fluff who gets the whole family grinning on rainy days, send in your photos and stories so we can share the love. To enter your hero dog, simply post your dog’s photo and story on the TeamDogs Pics of dogs page. Her owner comes to pick her up at the end of the day and Ivy is then shown fast asleep when she gets home, worn out from her big adventure. The precious pup’s first day has more than two million views on TikTok, with many people commenting on Ivy’s popularity at the daycare. “Ivy AKA Marilyn Monroe,” one person said. “She had all the dogs flocking to her.” “Ivy is obviously the main character,” another added. Others praised the idea of a care facility that caters specially to dogs. “Dog daycare is genius,” one TikTok user said. “We do have to work. Better than leaving them alone all day.”But for pups at home, there are ways to keep themselves entertained - likethis golden retrieverwho can’t tear his eyes away from The Lion King.Nobu can be seen wagging his tail as he sits engrossed in his favourite Disney film, proving that movie night isn’t just a pastime for humans.

Gabby, , ventured into the disused s diner earlier this year after reading articles about the eatery – which closed after the owners ran into financial dficulties. And although the diner shut down years ago, the property has been left untouched, and there are still plates, cutlery, and mugs left lying on the tables. The restaurant – which is in an undisclosed location in the US – still has all the hallmarks of a traditional American diner, including booths with white and red leather seating and breakfast menus on the tables. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Gabby said: “Seeing this location was really exciting for me as it was my first time ever getting the chance to explore an abandoned diner. It is a much more unique type of abandoned place to find. “Iaposm always happy when I see that a lot of the original pieces to the location have been left behind – in this case a lot of the dishes, silverware, and equipment for the diner. “It helps paint a picture of what the place must have been and felt like while it was still active.” It’s believed the unnamed diner was shut down in the s, but the property itself is a perfectly persevered s-style restaurant.  The eatery even still has much of its old equipment left inside, including a milkshake machine, a coffee maker and ious other cooking apparatus. Gabby added: “This gave the location an eerie and somewhat haunting feel, almost aseveryone just got up and left and never thought about looking back. “Behind the counter there were countless pieces of equipment left to rot, from coffee pots and condiment bottles to toasters and even old signage for their menu specials.” The diner has been largely untouched since it was left abandoned, and Gabby insisted she would not be disclosing the location of the restaurant in the hopes of keeping it as preserved as possible.  And although the building was still structurally intact, the woman said it had started to “decay quite intensely”.The woman shared a video of the “eerie” diner to her . million followers on TikTok on her account @urbex_muse – and commenters couldn’t believe the site was in such good condition for an abandoned property.One person said: “I literally don’t understand how this place is abandoned or why.” While another wrote: “This looks way too good to be abandoned.” And a third posted: “This might be the cleanest place you have ever been.” Despite wanting to leave the diner the way she found it, Gabby – who visited the eerie location with her boyfriend, Sonny – did leave a small memento there for the next adventurer to find. She said: “I was most surprised to see an old letter board that was used by the diner while it was still in operation to list the daily specials. “Sonny and I actually found some letters still left at the diner and decided to have some fun by replacing a few lines on the letter board to make it say aposTodayaposs daily specials – cowapos. “We thought it was pretty funny and that it would be something cool to add into our TikTok videos we were filming of the dinner.”Have you got a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Most recently, she offered to host a girlsapos night in at her house, which sounds innocent enough. And yet, when she told her boyfriend what she was getting up to, she was unprepared for the onslaught of abuse she would receive. We donapost live together but we do meet at my place every weekend. He called and asked what we will be doing on Friday and I said I wanted to host a GNI since it was my turn. He asked what the heck was a GNI, and I explained a girls night in, the woman explained on Redditaposs AITA forum.He got quiet then askedI was being series. I was confused as he started talking about how outdated and so s those events are and said that I should stop promoting and advocating for those events as they are so toxic and flat out reek of misogyny. The woman was left feeling completely baffled by her boyfriendaposs comments and said she still planned to host the event, despite him trying to talk her out of it. The man even suggested that he and some of his guy mates should come along, but the woman refused, reminding him thataposs not how girlsapos night works. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.  He called me a sexist and misogynistic for having a girls night in and making it so obvious instead of being ashamed of myself. He said that my mentality will cause me issues in the future especiallyI behave like that in a professional work setting, she continued. I was blown away by how he got so worked up like that over me just missing my girls and wanting to spend time with them. We argued some more and he hung up on me after I said I will not stop hosting or being part of GNIs no matter what he says about it. However, once everything calmed down, the woman decided to call her boyfriend to apologise for lashing out, and in response she received a series of texts from her boyfriend saying how aposhurtapos he was about how she handled their aposdisagreement.apos He even said he needs time to process what he just found out about [his girlfriendaposs] personality. This hurt me but my friendship and the bond I share with my girlfriends is huge and I donapost want to risk years of friendships by no longer being part of our bonding activities, the woman explained, before turning to Reddit to question whether she was right to refuse to put an end to her girlsapos nights. One Reddit user commented: How is girls night sexist   No offence but youaposve said that youaposve only been dating a couple of months and he throws a tantrum over you not picking him over spending time with your friends. Thataposs a red flag. Couples in romantic relationships are allowed to have interests and friendships outside of the romantic relationship, another added: He sounds very controlling. Don’t let him isolate you from your friends. A third wrote: Coming from a man, run away from this boy. Flipping out about a girlaposs night or needing me time or any time separate from him is a huge red flag and shows how clingy and controlling he will be down the line.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The stunning photos have been crowned the best on the planet in the annual Birth Photographer of the Year [BPOTY] awards, in collaboration with Atkins Lab. It was set up by award-winning birth photographer Lacey Barratt, who says she wants to further legitimise the stunning and intricate art of birth photography. The -year-old from Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, has been a passionate birth photographer for  years and was one of fourteen experienced judges to pick the winners of the awards. First place was awarded to Laura Brink, from Queensland, Australia, second place was presented to Rianna Cross, also from Queensland, Australia and third place was granted to Colby Tulachanh, from New York, USA. But with  entries snapped by birth photographers from around the world - including Brazil, Portugal, France, Germany, Australia and New Zealand - Lacey felt it was important to showcase the top images of the competition. Lacey, a mum-of-five, felt it was “important” to host the event, as out of the many other incredible competitions around the world there weren’t many specic to birth photographers. “So we often get lumped in with documentary, photojournalism, and wedding documentary categories. Judging and comparing a birth image with a wedding photo are just two completely dferent ends of the spectrum,” she said. “To have a  of judges trained specically in birth photography was paramount to the legitimacy of such a prestigious award. “Our work is so paramount to birthing people, because it allows them to take charge of their emotional autonomy even though our physical autonomy may have been taken from us. When we view our images, we get to choose how we feel about them. And that is powerful in itself.” This was the second year of the prestigious competition and Lacey added she was excited to keep it going for years to come. She said: “We are looking for images that exceed the standard of what would be given to a birth client. “The images we are looking for exceed visual communication, are above the standard of storytelling that we would expect any professional to deliver. “The energy surrounding the competition was so electric.  I was honoured to host such an incredible event that this niche so desperately desired.”To see all the winning photographs, go towww.birthphotographeroftheyearComment MORE ON Documentaries\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Cumbre Vieja volcano started to erupt on September  and are there are some signs that it might be approaching the beginning of the end. Director of the National Geographic Institute in the Canaries, María José Blanco has said that the eruptive process has entered a more stable phase but that stability has to be maintained for a certain time and even diminish in a gradual and sustained manner in all sectors. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here These include, he said, the levels of seismicity, tremor, deformations and SO emissions. The emergency committee on La Palma has ruled out new confinement measures as there are no population centres near the area. The emission of sulfur dioxide associated with the volcanic plume continues to be high, registering a range of values between , and , tons per day, but its temporal evolution reflects a downward trend since last September , when highs were recorded above , tons per day.  In the case of the dfuse emission of carbon dioxide , associated with the volcanic ridge of Cumbre Viejait reflects an upward trend, but according to the scientic committee, they do not represent a danger to people. The height of the ash scattering cloud measures  metres. The red-hot lava has now devoured more than , properties, including houses, businesses and farms, as well as destroying roads and banana plantations, together with avocado crops and vineyards. Footage coming from Spain today shows the flow devouring houses before spilling over a steep ridge and onto the beach. Some , people have been evacuated from their homes due to the dangers. The Cumbre Vieja volcano in La Palma erupted at pm local time, one hour behind the rest of Spain, on Sunday September , sending huge amounts of lava oozing through nearby villages.  Mayor Sergio Rodriguez said at the time that the lava “left absolutely nothing in its path. President of the La Palma island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, said that the lava was literally eating up the houses, infrastructure and crops that it is finding on its path toward the coast in the valley of Aridane.” Spainaposs Ministry of Defence announced yesterday that the vessel Castilla has been deployed to La Palma where it will embark today to help the islandaposs farmers with the distribution of produce and equipment.Schools have been closed with classes conducted remotely since last week due to a deterioration in air quality, however, The Canary Islands Education Board announced that pupils are expected toto school in Los Llanos de Aridane, El Paso, Tazacorte, Puntagorda and Tijarafe from today, AS reported.

Jesus rebuked him for his unbelief and said: ‘Blessed are those who have not seen yet believe.’We believe lots of things, not because we can see them for ourselves but by accepting the word of those who have.Christians believe in Jesus, not because we have seen him with our own eyes, but because of the reliable word of the apostles who physically saw the risen Jesus with their own eyes.I

model-making courtesy of Jim Parkyn, lead modelmaker at Aardman Animations, the studio behind Wallace and Gromit and Shaun the Sheep.Jim will help the youngsters create their own monsters, inspired by the likes of Godzilla, the original kaiju – Japanese monster – on film.The children could see their own creations tearing up the Wee Toon as the models will then be used to create a special monster movie which will be screened the following day, on Hallowe#en itself, alongside Gamera: The Giant Monster.Parents are welcome to sit in on the workshop which will last  minutes and will include a chance to ask questions and hear about the master model-maker#s work.The £ workshop ticket includes entry to Gamera: The Giant Monster but spaces are limited and those interested are advised to book as soon as possible.On Saturday afternoon, there will be family anime with Studio Ghibli#s multi-award-winning Spirited Away, considered to be one of the greatest animated films.In the evening, for

scrapped.Argyll and Bute Council agreed to continue the Ring and Ride service whilst it takes time to look for an alternative.Councillor Rory Colville, community spokesman for Argyll and Bute Council, said: #We are responding to the concerns of the people who need this service most.#It will continue in its current form for as long as it takes to make an informed decision about changes and we will make people aware of what will be provided in the future.#No timescale was given as to whether this would be before next May#s elections.In last year#s budget, the service was earmarked for the axe at the time, but the council gave assurances alternative arrangements would be put in place.Councillor John Semple said: #I am glad to see that finally some common sense seems to be filtering through – only three weeks ago the administration voted to continue with this cut.#I will continue to look after the interests of the most vulnerable people in this community as the administration#s plans materialise.#Argyll First councillor Donald Kelly was a prime mover in establishing and expanding the service and is totally against the withdrawal.He told the Courier that this is only a stay of execution for this service and assurances are needed that the service will be retained in the long-term.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOThe MP for Argyll and Bute has pressed for additional facts about the ferry service between Campbeltown and Ballycastle.During last Friday#s Scottish Questions in the House of Commons, Mrs Ray Michie pressed the Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr Michael Forsyth, for more information.She said: #I welcome the announcement, at long last, of the ferry service, although I am disappointed Caledonian MacBrayne was not allowed to run it.#She went on to ask: #For how long does Sea Containers have the contract  Is the Secretary of State expecting the service eventually to run all year, so that we can build up not only a good tourist service, but a good import and export trade #Mr Forsyth responded: #It was important for the new route to be established. It was possible to achieve that with a private sector operator taking the risk, which means that CalMac#s available public capital and running costs can be deployed on maintaining other services and introducing new ones.#It must be the right approach to use the state#s nationalised service and the scarce resources available to it as wisely as possible.#That was what lay behind our thinking.#He went on to say that he would write to Mrs Michie regarding the contract.Mrs Michie commented: #It is important we get the full facts about this service so that we can judge whether this really is value for money as the government claims.#FIFTY YEARS AGOEmergency sea rescue services in the Firth of Clyde could have been victims of another hoax on Friday.For the Campbeltown leboat, three naval vessels and a Dakota aircraft spent nearly six hours searching Kilbrannan Sound and its approaches for a boat reported to have been sinking off Campbeltown.The drama began at lunchtime when the Campbeltown leboat mechanic, Mr Alistair Gilchrist, intercepted a wireless message which read: #Mayday Boy Danny sinking  degrees off Campbeltown.#Kildonan Coastguard Station, Troon Leboat Station and Portpatrick Radio also picked up the call the boat#s name, however, was not mentioned in the message received by the other three stations.Then a full-scale search operation swung into operation. Along with the leboat, the warship HMS Eastbourne, Fishery Protection vessel Vigilant and the US Navy ship Victoria began combing the area between the south of Arran and Kintyre.They were joined later in the search by a Dakota aircraft from Prestwick.An RAF patrol vessel stood by at Campbeltown.Campbeltown leboat reported the discovery of a large piece of timber. It was, however, too heavy to lt aboard and it was not thought to be part of possible wreckage.Then, after six hours, the search was called off. The plane and boats had covered an extensive area of sea.Coastguards using mobile equipment searched along the shores of Arran and Kintyre.Nothing was seen.Police in Campbeltown began investigations into the matter shortly after the leboat put to sea their enquiries are continuing.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAuchencorvie United, one of the teams that came into being in the rural area as a result of the formation of sports clubs among agricultural workers, made their first appearance in local competitive football last Saturday afternoon.Drumlemble supplied the opposition and had a comparatively easy victory by four goals to nil.Auchencorvie had several players of some promise but, as a whole, the team was sadly wanting in science and judgement and the lesson of their first experience should impress on them the fact that mere lusty vigour is not sufficient to win on the football field.In the first half, Drumlemble did not press their undoubted superiority unduly, being content with a one-goal lead at the interval. James Munro was the scorer.In the second half they added three more to the total, D Thomson having two and A Kerr one.At the opening concert of the winter session of the Scottish Clans# Association of London Mr Charles Kelly, a well-known Campbeltown vocalist, sang with much success.His pieces were The March of the Cameron Men, The Lea Rigg, I Passed By Your Window and Until.In all these numbers he had a fine reception, especially from Campbeltonians in the audience of whom there seemed to be a goodly number.A correspondent writing with regard to the work of the association says that there are probably a good many Kintyre folk in London who would find it a great pleasure to join the Scottish Clans and take part in society#s many s.The atmosphere is truly Scottish and the gatherings have a homeliness about them which appeals greatly to the newcomer."},{"url":null,"title":"late late show as pupils cruelly lose out","story":"Campbeltown Pupils were left to rue the loss of another late goal last Saturday after an th-minute strike resigned the Kintyre Park side to a narrow defeat away to St Peter#s.Playing at Renfrew FC#s impressive New Western Park, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils started the match brightly, despite another y injury list which saw several established first-team players ruled out and others unavailable due to work commitments.The Pupils took the lead before the -minute mark when John McCallum, playing at right wing in a --- formation, reacted quickest to Craig Lamont#s long throw-in, which bounced up on the dry synthetic surface, to guide a deft looping header beyond the reach of the St Peter#s keeper.The Kintyre side had efforts from left winger Scott Souden and lone striker Sean Grady go wide of the target – the latter#s promising effort deflected wide of goal – while McCallum was released by Grady and rounded the hosts# keeper only for his cutback to be cleared for a corner, away from the feet of the waiting Souden.At the other end, the Pupils had a new-look combination in defence, with full backs Craig Lamont and Michael McKinlay, and Ross Souden in central defence partnered by -year-old debutant Antonio Akoulli, studying in Scotland and hailing from Thessaloniki, Greece.The four had to be alert to the efforts of St Peter#s wingers Menzies and Lewis on either flank, and did so very well for the opening  minutes until a lapse in concentration saw Scott Lewis – signed from fellow WoSFL side Benburb FC for a transfer fee – ghost along the edge of the box and slot home a fine finish across keeper Alasdair Ferguson with his weaker left foot, into the young keeper’s bottom left-hand corner to make it -.Impressively, the Pupils rebounded from this setback and scored with  minutes played when Liam Renton, playing as an attacking midfielder, latched onto a ball from Scott Souden just inside the hosts# box, and turned his marker sharply before guiding a left-footed shot beyond the keeper#s grasp.All the while, the Pupils# deep-lying midfield pairing – a real contrast of experience levels between skipper Keith Mitchell, and Conner Brown beside him making his club debut – continued to break up play and keep the Feathers Inn-sponsored side moving forward.Despite this, there was a further scare in the visitors# penalty area when St Peter#s hit the bar from a powerful volleyed shot on the stroke of half time, but the Pupils# lead remained intact.Into the second half, though, the Pupils were pegged back in the opening few minutes of proceedings, a clever turn and precise shot beyond the grasp of Ferguson providing a fine equaliser.Admirably from a Pupils point of view, there was no onslaught from the ision#s third-placed team, also boasting a loan signing from Greenock FC, another semi-professional side, in their midfield ranks, and smatterings of semi-pro experience across their starting .However, what followed instead was a gradual build-up of pressure which the Pupils had to work increasingly hard to contain, the home side#s willing forwards continuing to probe for openings in the visitors# defence.The hard-working pair of Matthew Lang and Calum Houston were introduced in attack for the Pupils with  minutes remaining, with fresh legs required as the embattled visitors# energy levels began to wane.But even the dismissal of Lewis for the hosts, hitting out at Renton in reaction to a robust tackle from the latter, which earned the Pupils man a booking, couldn#t deny the Paisley side a late, late winner, a long ball going undefended in the Pupils ranks, and slotted home in the box by a St Peter#s midfielder to give them all three points, and in turn deny the Pupils a probably deserved draw.The Pupils# management team conveyed thanks to the travelling players for their efforts, even in defeat, and will surely take consolation from giving experience to young talent in the side, with four club debuts made in the space of week – after -year-old Andrew Renton#s appearance against Rossvale on cup duty – and within that clutch, a potentially very useful defensive addition.Tomorrow , the Pupils are at home to Glenvale FC, from Paisley, again on league duty, with kick off at pm.For more information, visit @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 29 2021","story":"More must be done to prevent the continued spate of

Martin says that the Spott Kirk Session minutes record the referral of Marion Lillie to the civil magistrate in  on a charge of supposed witchcraft and that in  the minutes record: ldquoMany witches burnt at the top of Spott Loan.Mr Martin was, however, wrong.The Spott Kirk Session minutes are exceptionally legible and clear, and they make no reference whatsoever in  to witch burning at Spott Loan or anywhere .Nor is there any mention of Marion Lillie in .However, in , Marion and her son complained to the kirk session that she was being slandered as a witch.A y investigation followed in which it came to light that Marion did indeed have that reputation locally.Since kirk sessions were not qualied to try witchcraft cases, the session passed the matter on to the civil magistrate, as they were required to do.However, there is no evidence of the case being taken any further and the Spott records show that Marion died a natural death in April  and was buried in Spott kirkyard with the usual ceremonial trappings of bell and mortcloth.Unfortunately, many writers on Scottish witchcraft make the mistake of simply repeating what other writers have written, instead of going to the original records to see what was really going on.Poor Marion has thus been slandered in print as an executed witch for over  years, when half an hour spent actually reading the church records of Spott could have revealed the truth.Until recently, a plaque at the Witchesrsquo Stone stated that Marion Lillie was burnt there, but this has now been replaced by one which makes no mention of her.It may well be that the Witchesrsquo Stone marks the execution of a witch, or witches, but the victim was not Marion Lillie, and any such execution was neither in  nor in , which in any case would be

It is common to find people in other countries well aware of the existence of the country of Scotland, even although that knowledge may have been acquired from seeing Brigadoon, Braveheart or the label on a bottle of whisky.As a result of this prominence, Scotland has a further claim to fame: it is the luckiest country in the world. Scots can rub shoulders with peoples from across the planet and interact with them on equal terms, and yet be unwilling to take full responsibility for governing their own country: in other words, they are world champions in having their cake and eating it.Ian Hutcheson, Glasgow.* YOU report that the First Minister met the President of Catalonia at COP. It is indicative of their senses of perspective and proportion that they chose to devote their discussion to local independence matters rather than the small matter of the future of the planet.At the same time, it was interesting to note the Presidentrsquos comment that ldquowhatever the Scottish people decide, Catalonia will support Scotland. It has of course been the policy of Nicola Sturgeon since  to do exactly the opposite, and to ignore what the people of Scotland decided.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.THE MANDATE FOR INDEPENDENCEMICHAEL Sheridandiscusses nationhood, statehood and independence in his letter. He uses some arguments I cannot agree with.For instance, it is indeed true that not all nations form independent states. India, Brazil, Germany or Nigeria are federal republics, very dferent from the UK Union. It is common though, that when national interests within one multinational state start to signicantly erge, democratic countries often decide to peacefully split up .Then there is the tiresome misconception unionist Brexiters use against Scottish independence, that being a member of the EU means not being an independent country. EU member states remain their own masters, they retain control of taxation and only those matters that absolutely need to be determined collectively are so determined.In the UK Union, the narrow constraints of the non-permanent devolution arrangements prevent Scotland from fully realising its ambition to be an open and trustworthy country with a just and fair society and sustainable wellbeing economy.Mr Sheridan mentioned that independence is something \"no one really wants\" in Scotland. In fact, barely six months ago the people of Scotland elected a majority of MSPs who contested the election on a clear mandate to hold a second independence referendum.It is perfectly legitimate to oppose independence. But it is not legitimate to deny democracy. And it is not legitimate to use untrue arguments to justy this lack of democracy.Marie White, Houston.WILL THEY NEVER TIRE OF THEIR BOSS I WATCHED an excellent House of Commons debate this afternoonon the subject of the mishandling of matters relating to Owen Paterson and the generalities surrounding the contemptible behaviour of Boris Johnson and co . There were many good points made from all sides of the House, but it was a pity that two of the main stars could not add their contributions.Mr Johnson was too busy where, but was back in London in time to make an appearance and the chance to apologise to the House. Jacob Rees-Mogglooked very uncomfortable while sitting on the naughty stool for a couple of hours with nothing to say. Stephen Barclay was probably feeling equally uncomfortable, but this was hidden by his face mask.How long will it be before Cabinet ministers decide that they are fed up with being wheeled out to make apologies for a boss who has no principles and who does not deserve to lead either his party or the country Malcolm Rankin, Seamill.* WESTMINSTER, the Mother of Parliaments and the envy of the world. It was always an arrogant and deluded boast but used to be just hot air. Now that air carries the stench of decay and desperation. The UK has become a grubby little place. I feel for our friends in England, but Scotland must free herself from this failing state.Grant McKechnie, Glasgow.SO IS SLEAZE INEVITABLE IN , in his dissertation on canon and feudal law, John Adams , the Second President of the USA, said: \"Liberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people, who have a right ... an indisputable, unalienable [sic], indefeasible, ine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge, I mean of the characters and conduct of their rulers.\"Given the current politicians who sit in Westminster and Holyrood, and the constant media reports of the inappropriate, and what is often defined as the \"sleazy\" behaviour of some of them, I can only assume that we have never had, nor will ever have, anything that can remotely be recognised as that particular \"right\" needed for the preservation of our liberty.Is government sleaze, and often untruthfulness, something we have to live with  Are we forever condemned to living in cloud-cuckoo-land  Are we just wishful thinkers Thelma Edwards, Kelso.NO VISION FOR REFORMING LORDSTHE row over party benefactors being elevated to the House of Lordshighlights the fact that there continues to be no plan or even vision for how to reconstruct that seemingly august but ultimately ludicrous institution into something recognisably democratic.In  the total number of its members was .

It merely stands as a stark reminder of the deficiencies in the supposedly democratic UK parliamentary system.Cameron Crawford, Rothesay.NICARAGUAS STRUGGLE MUST CONTINUETHE presidential elections in Nicaragua on Sunday have been widely denounced as a democratic fraud.Neither the government of Chile nor neighbouring Central American country Costa Rica recognises the results after reports of a national average abstention of .%. This ied from % to % locally, although there was no public boycott campaign.However, as many potential candidates, also critical of the Ortega Murillo regime, had been illegally detained, people tried to register a protest by not voting properly and so making the election invalid.Urnas Abiertas, an observer organisation estimated only .% participation by the electorate.

As of this evening  pupils have been confirmed as COVID-positive, along with five members of staff. A further four members of staff have recorded positive lateral flow test results.As a result, the nursery has been forced to close entirely, while four primary classes will remain home.The classes to close from Monday to Wednesday are: PM, PE. Classes PE and PM are to close on Monday only at this time. Online learning will be offered to affected pupils.According to a statement released by OIC, this evening, the situation will remain under daily review andthe position changes, parents and staff will be updated.The remainder of classes at Papdale Primary School will be open on Monday as usual.James Wylie, OIC’s executive director of education, leisure and housing said: “Staff have been working tirelessly over the last week to try and ensure Papdale Primary and Nursery were able to remain open in full, however, this has now reached the point where it is simply no longer possible. There are several factors for this including staff reporting positive PCR test results, being contact traced by Public Health, and the supply teaching staff list having been exhausted.“We realise that this may cause childcare issues for working parents and that is partly why we will keep the closures to an absolute minimum and monitor and manage the situation on a daily basis, ensuring that the settings are able to reopen once it is safe to do so with the appropriate staffing levels in place. It is also vital that we keep our educational facilities open whenever possible for the learning of our children, who have already missed out on so much these past  months of the pandemic.“I, again, take this opportunity to thank our staff, parents and pupils for the way in which we all continue to manage these situations, which are challenging for everyone. We must all continue to do our bit to try and stem the transmission of the virus, which is undoubtedly here for some time to come.

According to authorities, many stayed hone due to a iety of COVID-related reasons, such as self-isolation or because they were symptomatic and awaiting a PCR test.A small number of parents have also chosen not to send their child children to school.James Wylie, OIC’s executive director of education, leisure and housing said: “Following advice from our colleagues at NHS Orkney Public Health during an inter-disciplinary meeting today, Friday, the joint decision was made to an agreed set of enhanced mitigating measures at Papdale Primary School.“The situation is being managed and monitored with the advice and guidance of Public Health for which we are very grateful.“It is important for schools to remain open while it is deemed safe by all to do so. We will continue to work with our colleagues at Public Health evaluating the numbers and should it reach a point whereby it is felt necessary for a partial or full closure, then that decision will be made collectively.“I, again, thank everyone for continuing to answer our plea for children who are well and not displaying any COVID symptoms to still attend at school as this is vital for their education and social well-being.”Targeted “warn and inform letters” have been sent to parents of children in the affected classes. Papdale head teacher, Wendy Bowen, has also written to all parents to reassure that all necessary mitigating steps are being taken.Meanwhile NHS Orkney are continuing to report double figure numbers of cases across the county on a daily basis.According to the health authority, these cases are a mixture of household contacts, travel and working environment contacts amongst others. As was mentioned last week, they were expecting to see numbers of cases continue to be high in coming days.NHS Orkney consultant of public health, Sara Lewis said: “Papdale Primary School remains open, but we have agreed an enhanced set of measures not only to reassure parents, pupils, staff and the wider community, but also to ensure we are doing all we can to keep on top of the situation. Schools do remain an area of typically low transmission and a safe place for children.“We ask that you continue to follow the guidance in place, ensuring good ventilationindoors, washing hands, wearing face coverings and keeping a safe distance from those out with your household,possible.”If you develop COVID symptoms, however mild, oryou have a positive lateral flow test, you must immediately self-isolate with your household and book a PCR test.

A further four members of staff are awaiting the results of a PCR test.It was announced yesterday evening that the school would be partially closed today, due to a lack of staff. Today,  pupils who were able to attend school did so, while  were provided online learning from home. A further  pupils were absent from school for a iety of reasons. Some remained at home due to developing COVID, or for self-isolation purposes, while others were kept home by parents due to concerns over the current situation.Orkney Islands Council has confirmed this evening that four classes will not be ing to school until at least Thursday. These are PM, PE and PE and PM.Papdale Nursery is also closed in full until the same date due to all staff having been contact traced.Authorities have said that the situation is being kept under constant review by NHS Orkney Public Health and OIC and daily updates are being provided to parents, staff and the wider community via the head teachers and communications on the council website and social media, and local media outlets.Online learning to those pupils having to remain at home is being provided by the school.OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, said: “The situation at Papdale is changing at pace and I must commend the Head Teacher and her staff for doing all they can to ensure learning continues for pupils whether that is in class or remotely during these extenuating circumstances. My same thanks must go to the Nursery manager and colleagues for also going the extra mile to work through the challenges.“Orkney has been very lucky up to this stage with comparatively low numbers of COVID-, however we are all now facing a very dferent picture – the waves which have hit other areas are now on our shores. I must also praise parents who have, on the whole, been very supportive of the staff at Papdale and recognise the tremendous efforts they have been putting in to try and follow the Public Health guidance and ensure the most appropriate and safe plans are in place.“As already said, we continue to meet with Public Health, Environmental Health, Safety and Resilience and Education staff to evaluate the present situation to influence the next steps. As a result of staffing issues due to COVID we have no alternative but to keep the P classes closed for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. We will update all parents as soon as possiblethis position changes and further closures are required.“We do understand that there are dfering opinions on this some parents are anxious about sending their child to school where there have been positive cases and there are others who feel that given the enhanced mitigating measures in place, that routines and learning should continue whenever possible.  What we must do as educators is look to the advice and guidance of Public Health and collectively, in a multi-agency way, find the balance.“I joined an Environmental Health colleague from the Council, along with the Head Teacher,  this morningon a walk through the school to evaluate the mitigations in place. For all those that may be concerned Environmental Health are confident that appropriate measures are being taken.“There is no doubt that the virus is not going to disappear in the near future so we must adapt as best we can. Our children deserve an education and that is what we will strive to provide. Please continue to follow the guidance which is outlined by our colleagues at NHS Orkney.”NHS Orkney say around one in three people with COVID- don’t show any symptoms.The health authority has emphasised that it’s more important than ever to take your two free COVID lateral flow tests every week and record your results, evenyou are fully vaccinated and don#t have symptoms.Lateral flow test kits can be collected from community pharmacies and local test sites or ordered online at nhsinform.scot testing.  You can access the direct link to order LFD tests here: https:www.gov.uk order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flow.Recording both positive and negative results allows the NHS to track the presence of the virus in our communities.Find out more at nhsinform.scot testingIf you, or anyone in your household is displaying symptoms of COVID, which include a continuous cough, temperature and loss in taste or smell, or you have a positive Lateral Flow testyou MUST self-isolate immediately and book a PCR test by calling  .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Spread word that is not correct, the best advice is DO NOTHING .Full explanationhellip https:t.co HtGhGUUWgvmdash Martin LewisNovember , But with the current crisis in the energy market and prices surging, cheap deals have vanished. Customers sitting on default deals are protected by the energy price cap.The envelopes were created before the energy price hikes.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said: ldquoWe are in an extreme energy bill crisis. The logic of how to manage bills has been turned on its head. There has never been a time when clarity of message and action is more important. Thatrsquos why the Government mailing out an incorrect message to millions of people, including many of the nationrsquos most vulnerable, is too big a risk to take.ldquoThe right move for most people right now is to do nothing ndash donrsquot switch. Thatrsquos becauseyou do nothing, yoursquoll either be on, or automatically moved to your providerrsquos default standard iable tarf, which is price capped. The price cap forces energy firms to sell energy at below its cost price ndash there is no meaningfully cheaper option.ldquoDue to the obvious hit to their finances, many big energy providers are trying to persuade people to move off those tarfs to fixed deals at premiums often far higher than %. They are using all the marketing tricks in the book to do it, and playing on the fact that until now that has been the right option.ldquoThis is why this back-of-the envelope message, which seems to confirm that switching is the right move, is so dangerous ndash it adds a halo to the message from the energy firms to get people to switch.A DWP spokesperson told the PA news agency: ldquoWe are committed to supporting low income and vulnerable households to keep warm during the colder months.ldquoWe have encouraged people to switch energy tarfs for a number of years to help them save money.ldquoThe message on these envelopes was simply a suggestion and no further will be issued.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211103_133201-scaled.jpg","title":"climate action group to hold skye bridge march and vigil in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, which formed shortly before the pandemic, is inviting people to show their solidarity with activists across the world in highlighting the need for urgent change to tackle the existential threat of climate change.Speaking to the Free Press during the first week of the COP UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Skye Climate Action coordinator Anne MacLennan described the summit as “critically important” and was keen to emphasise that Saturday’s event should take place in a peaceful and respectable manner.#Saturday is the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, and the themes are that we need to act, and act urgently, and there is also the huge justice issue,# she said.“The idea for the march is for us to leave the Kyleakin-end at  noon and to walk over the bridge by the pavements and walk back again.#It is really important that the event is peaceful, family-friendly, and respectful of everyone # I think it is a demonstration of the kind of society we want to head towards being, so we can live in a sustainable and equitable way. Issues of climate, bioersity, equity are all interconnected.She added: “I think it is more powerfulit is a peaceful walk.#Giving her views on the progress being made at the COP, she added: “There are some really hard-hitting things being said, so I hope the issues are getting through to people. It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

He was unaware that he was the registered owner of the company or its bank accounts.However, the Belfastcan reveal the money laundering scam was not only operating in the Republic. The organised crime gang from both sides of the border was also using people here to launder money through dummy accounts, including a man based in north Belfast and one in the Markets area of the city.Both were heavy drinkers who prior to Covid often boasted online about foreign trips to Spain and Croatia despite being unemployed and with no visible means of income.Dozens of dummy accounts in the names of people from both sides of the border were registered to a council house in Manchester. The companies — claiming to be haulage, engineering or car sales — were registered to an address in the Denton area of the city.Another vehicle hire and haulage business was registered to an address in Bolton in the name of a man from north Belfast with dissident republican links.Read MoreBig read: ‘An ordeal of callous brutality’ that left Quinn executive Kevin Lunney with le-altering injuriesIn profile: The le and crimes of ‘Dublin Jimmy’, the man who orchestrated Kevin Lunney abductionThe address claiming to be a haulage business was in fact an empty house in a rundown area of the northern English town.The money being laundered was the criminal assets of a building and agriculture machinery theft ring, with expensive vehicles being stolen in Ireland and sold in Britain with fake registration papers.The gang was also involved in more than a dozen ATM robberies on both sides of the border in , raking in hundreds of thousands of pounds.And McGuinness was laundering money from an unnamed ‘paymaster’, who is believed to have given the criminals a signicant sum to carry out the attack on Mr Lunney.While McGuinness used gangsters from Dublin to assist in the kidnap, the majority of the attacks on the QIH property and directors were carried out by ‘border bandits’, who had previous republican links but had also been involved in smuggling, ATM robberies and cross-border criminality.The Belfastunderstands many of the attacks over a six-year campaign against the QIH directors were coordinated locally by the ‘border bandits’ with no money changing hands.Following the convictions on Monday, Garda Commissioner Drew Harris said multiple lines of inquiry were ongoing, including financial investigations.He also said the inquiry was being supported by a cross-border joint investigation team, which is being supervised by Eurojust.Read MoreAllison Morris:OpinionKevin Lunney attack convictions won’t stop campaign of intimidationMost ReadLong-lost son of Tyrone tycoon Sean McHugh claiming over £m from his estateFuneral announced for Harry Byrne , who was killed tragically in freak hurling accidentStrabane woman ‘forgot’ orce in bid to claim husband’s estateNo regrets: DUP’s Sammy Wilson breaks silence on Owen Paterson supportCo Antrim plumber pleads guilty over £, heating system fraudTop VideosPlayStrike action in Portadown as workers picket for £ an hour pay increasePlayReformed former prisoner Rosie Bradley creates artwork for north Belfast cross-community boxing clubPlayWatch: Lockdown has brought more surfers to North Coast Latest Northern IrelandDerry man whose body was discovered in alleyway had been stabbed over  times, court hears‘Time marching on’ on protocol negotiations – Sir Jeffrey DonaldsonSome mother and baby home recommendations could be implemented ‘very quickly’Irish premier calls on UK to ‘double down on dialogue’ on NI ProtocolMLA says road defects figures ‘clearly indicate an east-west ide’LatestMeghan apologises to court over recollection of aides’ exchanges with authorsDerry man whose body was discovered in alleyway had been stabbed over  times, court hearsFans welcomed back to Downton with first-look images from A New EraLight operators and green activists in Cop summit building projection face-offGlass Animals secure US chart record with viral hit Heat Waves,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I didn’t expect him to draft me a personal reply but I’m extremely disappointed that my letter wasn’t even acknowledged.”In May, the NIO said they were on schedule to offer trees in September to schools, which could be planted last month.A spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Office spokesperson said the tree planting school project is on schedule.Every school in Northern Ireland has been offered a native tree to plant as part of the Centenary year,” they said.Delivery of these trees remains on schedule, and they are currently being supplied to all  schools who have responded to our offer.“We are supplying additional trees to some of these schools, to support a range of wellbeing and environmental initiatives.Stormont’s Department for Agriculture has been approached for comment.Meanwhile, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has blasted as “offensive, madness” the block on importing certain species of trees here.On Tuesday, his predecessor as DUP leader, Edwin Poots, announced Glenarm Forest in Co Antrim has been accredited as a Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy conservation forest.The first trees were planted as part of the project which Mr Poots said would create a lasting legacy of the Queen’s leadership of the Commonwealth.According to the Daily , however, the Woodland Trust cannot send its trees to Northern Ireland from Great Britain.“Recent changes to regulations through the NI protocol mean we are currently unable to ship our trees to Northern Ireland,” it said.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told the newspaper: “It is madness that we cannot plant UK trees from the mainland in our own country to celebrate Her Majesty#s Platinum Jubilee.“It is offensive that British soil, seeds, plants and trees cannot be transported from one part of the UK to another.”The protocol sees Northern Ireland follow EU plant health rules, which forbid non-EU imports of certain trees.There have been issues since the ‘Irish Sea border’ came into being at the start of the year. Some suppliers have complained of a burden of bureaucracy and stopped shipments.Nurseries stopped sending  species of trees, including English Oak, yew, beech, honeysuckle and elm, to Northern Ireland.

I was just taking tablets to cover it up. “I want people to know you could be covering up something you don’t know is there. It could be nothing but get yourself checked out. “I went to the GP who took bloods and suggested I do a FIT test. The results of the FIT test showed that something wasn’t right and within two weeks I was referred to the Endoscopy unit to have a colonoscopy. “This test showed up something in the bowel. After a week, I got the result that I had bowel cancer. “I received a lot of help and support from the specialist nurses. After that, I had a CT and an ultrasound.” Anthony underwent surgery October  and is currently recovering at home with the support of his we.

They couldn’t do enough for you. They work so hard. They haven’t got enough staff and still do everything that needs to be done. “Some of the nurses work hourshts and get no break. I can’t understand why they get any negative comments, they’ve been nothing but brilliant to me. “I know it can be hard to get an appointment but the minute I said my symptoms, I was seen to straight away. “The GPS have been most compassionate and supportive.

SDLP Foyle MLA Sineacutead McLaughlin has called for a strategy to be urgently put in place to deal with the rise in drink spiking incidents. googletag.cmd.push Ms McLaughlin said: “The dramatic rise in reported spiking incidents in the last month shows how common this issue has become and how under reported it has been. Since speaking out on this issue I have been contacted by a number of women who have been victims of spiking. It is important that even more people come forward to report possible criminal activities to the PSNI, as well as to tell their story and share their experience so we can best decide how to tackle this issue. “Drink spiking is a horrendous experience for anyone to be subjected to and it can have long-lasting effects. It can destroy someone’s confidence and leave them reluctant to venture out to socialise for fear of being subjected to a similar attack. Spiking places people directly in harm’s way, it greatly affects people’s self-control and leaves them vulnerable to injury and harm. Most disturbingly of all, it can be used to facilitate rape and other forms of sexual assault. “These recent incidents have demonstrated the importance of dealing with spiking as part of the Executive Office’s strategy for addressing violence against women and girls. I will continue to push for urgent action on this issue in my role as Executive Office Committee chair. We need a joined-up approach to ensure that anyone subjected to spiking gets the help and support they need and that perpetrators are appropriately punished to send out a message this is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated in our society.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a -year-old man following a drugs seizure in Derry this morningLocal NewsArrest made in drugs bust following Police raid on Derry properties overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  All health workers should receive pound payment before ChristmasDerry NewsFerguson: All health workers should receive pound payment before Christmas overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gary Middleton MLA: There is nothing achieved through burning vehicles but there is nothing achieved either through exacerbating fears.Local NewsInferred risks should not have halted Waterside bus services overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MLA Sinead McLaughlin has said there is urgent strategy needed to tackle rise in drink spiking incidentsDerry News drink spiking incidents reported in the last six weeks to PSNI overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Marie lost her mum to the horrible disease and planned to walk  walks to raise funds to support families and those with the condition locally. googletag.cmd.push Marie is about to embark on walk number  as she gets closer to her goal. Maries fundraiserhas already raised nearly pound for Alzheimers Society. Marie said: “For any of you that know me, you will be aware that I lost my lovely wee mammy in February . “Her name was Elizabeth Diamond, known as Bertha to her friends and family. My mum had Alzheimer’s disease. She was so loving and caring to everyone, decent, kind and loved a bit of craic. She lived independently with my dad in her bungalow. “However, over a number of years, this horrible disease took everything away from the person I loved. I have to admit I used to think that Alzheimer’s was memory loss and how wrong I was. “In the early stages, mum would forget dates and words and recall short-term events. She would repeat her stories quite a lot. Then it progressed to dficulty in piecing together what she wanted to say or to follow others in conversation, she lost the ability to cook and needed more and more care. “She could remember events from a long time ago when she was younger. We then experienced mood swings, sometimes irritation over the slightest things and sometimes withdrawn. In the end times, she couldn’t remember eating, food was hot and then cold or unfamiliar to her, she would have dficulty swallowing and worst of all repeating pleas for help. “My dad passed away in May  and sometimes she remembered he was gone and other times not. It was just awful but I am grateful that she knew me till the end. “I really wanted to do something positive for those suffering from this condition and for their families. So, I am doing  walks for Dementia. Why   Because that was the age my mum was when she died so one walk for each year of her le. “Mum didn’t walk herself but she lived in both the Cityside and Waterside of Derry. I’m going to walk the two bridges-Craigavon and Foyle- because it captures the city, it’s a nice walk of seven miles with lovely scenery. “I’m no athlete and whilst this would be easy for others it’s a challenge for me.  walks at seven miles per walk is  miles. However, I also want  partners to walk with me. “They can do the walk for someone they love that is or has suffered from dementia, they can do it for charity or just to support me. I’m not tied to it being the bridges, I’m also open to doing a walk that means something to my partner on the day.” For every walk, Marie will donate pound which gives a starting total of pound for the charity. “As I said, I’m definitely not an athlete but I want to do two-three walks a week. This will take me at least six months and I started at the beginning of June. “I’m conscious of some holiday time and hopefully not butany injury means I need to cut back a bit my goal is to have it all completed before my mum’s second anniversary, in February .” If you want to join Marie on her walk, either inidually, as a group or as a relay team, contact Maire via the fundraiser Facebook page:https:www.facebook WalksForDementia  To donate, go to:https:www.justgiving fundraising -walks-for-dementiaADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

This will take me at least six months and I started at the beginning of June. “I’m conscious of some holiday time and hopefully not butany injury means I need to cut back a bit my goal is to have it all completed before my mum’s second anniversary, in February .” If you want to join Marie on her walk, either inidually, as a group or as a relay team, contact Maire via the fundraiser Facebook page:https:www.facebook WalksForDementia  To donate, go to:https:www.justgiving fundraising -walks-for-dementiaADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a -year-old man following a drugs seizure in Derry this morningLocal NewsArrest made in drugs bust following Police raid on Derry properties overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  All health workers should receive pound payment before ChristmasDerry NewsFerguson: All health workers should receive pound payment before Christmas overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gary Middleton MLA: There is nothing achieved through burning vehicles but there is nothing achieved either through exacerbating fears.Local NewsInferred risks should not have halted Waterside bus services overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MLA Sinead McLaughlin has said there is urgent strategy needed to tackle rise in drink spiking incidentsDerry News drink spiking incidents reported in the last six weeks to PSNI overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a -year-old man following a drugs seizure in Derry this morningLocal NewsArrest made in drugs bust following Police raid on Derry properties overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  All health workers should receive pound payment before ChristmasDerry NewsFerguson: All health workers should receive pound payment before Christmas overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gary Middleton MLA: There is nothing achieved through burning vehicles but there is nothing achieved either through exacerbating fears.Local NewsInferred risks should not have halted Waterside bus services overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MLA Sinead McLaughlin has said there is urgent strategy needed to tackle rise in drink spiking incidentsDerry News drink spiking incidents reported in the last six weeks to PSNI overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Mr Doyle, who represents the Ballyarnett ward, said that people needed to see “a concrete commitment from Ulster University about Magees expansion”. His remarks come after the Vice-Chancellor, Paul Bartholomew, conceded that the aim of having , students at Magee College was not feasible with  being a more realistic target. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Doyle spoke in Octobers monthly meeting of Derry City  Strabane District Council in favour of inviting Galway-based National University of Irelandto help assist Ulster University in expanding Magees numbers – a motion that was voted down by Council. “The expansion of Magee saga has gone on too long and establishment parties are in a flap about what exactly their position is,” said Cllr Doyle. “In my time as an elected representative the one thing that has been clear is that commitment of partners right across the city to demonstrate long term planning for the city even without finances in place. “I am very concerned about the recent developments around Magee. Firstly the Vice Chancellor tells us on the record that the most we can hope for in terms of Magee student numbers is . “Then Sinn Feacutein, the SDLP, DUP and UUP block a proposal at Council to even speak to the NUI about Magee’s future. “People need to see a concrete commitment from Ulster University about Magee’s expansion. If, for example, the Department for the Economy allocated Ulster University more student places tomorrow, we would have no guarantees that Magee would benefit. “Therefore I am calling on senior leadership within the University to create an ‘Expansion Unit’ within the Vice Chancellor’s Office to specically research, plan and implement into Ulster University’s corporate planning how Magee can grow. They have specic resources in place for Brexit, so this is no dferent. “If confidence is to be built around the partnership with Ulster University for the city deal then I believe this is a prudent and demonstrable action that can help us move forward and I will be re-iterating this to the Vice-Chancellor in the coming weeks.” In response, a spokesperson for Ulster University said: “During the Derry City and Strabane Strategic Growth partnership meeting, Vice-Chancellor Professor Paul Bartholomew extended an open invitation to discuss in depth the university’s commitment and plans with councillors in person – this invitation is open to Cllr Emmet Doyle.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Cllr Duffy, who represents the Ballyarnett ward, has long been involved in helping to make the road safe. Back in September, Cllr Duffy successfully lobbied for a pedestrian crossing to be installed on the Skeoge Road to help ensure that residents wouldnt have to risk being knocked down by speeding motorists in order to get across safely. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Duffy, who has also contacted the Council requesting that the main roundabout there be planted out with flowers and vegetation, said the repaired railings would not only be a safety measure for residents but that the restored frames will remove the eyesore that were the damaged ones. She said “I very much welcome the news that the Department for Infrastructurehas installed new safety railings at the Skeoge Road. “Anyone travelling up or down this road on a daily basis would have seen a number of badly damaged railings and crash barriers. “I have been liaising with DFI now for months in an effort to get these fixed not only as a safety measure for motorists and pedestrians, but they were also an eyesore on a busy route entering our city and linking into Donegal. “I am also waiting on an update from the Council regarding having the roundabout there being planted outwith flowers and vegetation to make it more attractive. “In the times ahead I will continue to pursue road safety issues in this area as a priority.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

A quarterly report from Ulster Universitys House Price Index show property price rises in the council area of Derry City  Strabane District leaping from an average of pound, in the previous quarter to pound, – a jump of . per cent. googletag.cmd.push The hike is signicantly higher than any other council area in the North with the next highest rise being in Fermanagh  Omagh with . per cent. Ards  North Downs prices rose by . per cent with Belfast only having a small rise of . per cent. The Ulster University research, which has been produced in partnership with the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and Progressive Building Society, analyses the performance of the Northern Ireland housing market during the third quarter of  . The report is premised upon , transactions and reveals an overall average house price of pound, which represents a weighted annual level of growth of . per cent between the third quarters of  and  respectively. Where quarterly movements are concerned, the Index displays an increase of . per cent relative to the second quarter of . This growth remains driven by increases within the semi-detached and detached segments of the market over the quarter. Lead Researcher, Dr Michael McCord, Reader in Real Estate, Ulster University said: “The main findings of this survey indicate a market which continues to exhibit increased trading up activity and price acceleration as a consequence of strong levels of market demand coupled with supply inelasticity. “Entering into , the market displayed strong resilience, with consecutive-quarter price inflation evident, driven by high demand and optimism. “This buoyancy has continued within this quarter, with notable structural market dynamics and challenges starting to emerge, particularly in relation to the lack of housing supply. “This, compounded with the volatile economic setting posed by the precarious inflationary environment, poses some challenges ahead for the housing market.” Ursula McAnulty, Head of Research at the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, which commissions the survey, added: “The latest figures produced by Ulster University confirm the ongoing strong demand in the residential housing market during the third quarter. “The number of transactions in the sample remained well above average, and average prices continued to rise as a result. “In what is traditionally a quieter period for the housing market, that effect may ease in the final quarter of the year, but there is still some expectation of ongoing demand and price growth. “However, as the cost of living increases, the situation for both prospective and existing borrowers may become more challenging as we look ahead into .” The figures for Derry will raise a eyebrow given the widening gap between home owners in the city and those still on waiting lists for social housing. Last month, Derry City  Strabane District Council passed SDLP councillor Lilian Seenoi-Barrs motion calling for council to write to the Joint First Ministers calling on them to publish a programme for government, which includes a housing strategy.  Cllr Lillian Seenoi-Barr of the SDLP At the time, Cllr Seenoi-Barr said: “Issues around accessing housing in Derry and Strabane stretch back decades and the whole of Northern Ireland is currently in the midst of a severe housing crisis. “People are currently struggling to access social housing, prices in the rental market are spiralling out of control and many young people are unable to save a deposit to get themselves on the housing ladder. “These problems are acutely felt in Derry and Strabane which has high numbers of people presenting as homeless, on social housing waiting lists and experiencing housing stress. We simply don’t have the housing required to meet demand. “I’m glad my fellow councillors backed my motion on this important issue. We need to see a programme for government from our Joint First Ministers which prioritises housing. “Everyone has a right to a home they can be proud of and they are currently being let down by those responsible for our housing crisis.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a -year-old man following a drugs seizure in Derry this morningLocal NewsArrest made in drugs bust following Police raid on Derry properties overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  All health workers should receive pound payment before ChristmasDerry NewsFerguson: All health workers should receive pound payment before Christmas overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gary Middleton MLA: There is nothing achieved through burning vehicles but there is nothing achieved either through exacerbating fears.Local NewsInferred risks should not have halted Waterside bus services overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MLA Sinead McLaughlin has said there is urgent strategy needed to tackle rise in drink spiking incidentsDerry News drink spiking incidents reported in the last six weeks to PSNI overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.     Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall.

Step up Neil Forester. It was a moment for guts and character, and the Oacuteg’s skipper took on the mantle as he ducked and ed his way through the opposition defence before firing over a superb leveller. googletag.cmd.push With Cahir McMonagle adding a free in added time, the title was sealed. An indescribable moment in time. “You can’t sum it up,” insisted Forester. “We’ve been chasing this for so long. It’s not just the final defeats either. We’ve been so close in semi-finals, had replays, and we’ve been knocking at the door for so, so long. “You wonderit’s ever going to happen orit is going to pass you by. Can we not deliver it for the people who have given so much to this club   “I’m thinking back of all the coaches that we’ve had that have put in serious work – Michael Heffernan, Tony Jackson, Donal McMahon. “I can’t describe it when you see people’s faces on the pitch afterwards. There’s Paul O’Hea, Darren McDaid, Aidan Cleary – all these incredible people that have given so much to the club and to do it for them just makes it so special. I can’t put it into words.” Anyone who knows Forester knows that the GAA runs in his veins. He has been a stalwart in the Oacuteg’s line-up for many years, and a former Derry defender. But the playing is only part of the story. A dedicated coach, Forester embraced teammates at the final whistle on Saturday that he himself had helped nurture. Ever the modest man, he wasn’t prepared to take all the credit. “I had Donncha , Oran , Cahir , Adam , Oran– they were all through the primary schools programme. “It’s crazy to think that that’s the hard work we started nine years ago when we started the programme, recruiting schools and coaching them a bit more intensely in the club, and it’s come to fruition. “People have put in serious effort and not just the players but the coaches, the administrators – people like Ann and Declan Lindsay who give so much to the club in the background. “Declan never misses a match doing umpire and we know how hard it is to do that. It’s the people like that - it is just amazing for them to celebrate the joy of this with us.”  WATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title  A late Cahir McMonigle free sealed victory over reigning champions Greenlough.

Step up Neil Forester. It was a moment for guts and character, and the Oacuteg’s skipper took on the mantle as he ducked and ed his way through the opposition defence before firing over a superb leveller. googletag.cmd.push With Cahir McMonagle adding a free in added time, the title was sealed. An indescribable moment in time. “You can’t sum it up,” insisted Forester. “We’ve been chasing this for so long. It’s not just the final defeats either. We’ve been so close in semi-finals, had replays, and we’ve been knocking at the door for so, so long. “You wonderit’s ever going to happen orit is going to pass you by. Can we not deliver it for the people who have given so much to this club   “I’m thinking back of all the coaches that we’ve had that have put in serious work – Michael Heffernan, Tony Jackson, Donal McMahon. “I can’t describe it when you see people’s faces on the pitch afterwards. There’s Paul O’Hea, Darren McDaid, Aidan Cleary – all these incredible people that have given so much to the club and to do it for them just makes it so special. I can’t put it into words.” Anyone who knows Forester knows that the GAA runs in his veins. He has been a stalwart in the Oacuteg’s line-up for many years, and a former Derry defender. But the playing is only part of the story. A dedicated coach, Forester embraced teammates at the final whistle on Saturday that he himself had helped nurture. Ever the modest man, he wasn’t prepared to take all the credit. “I had Donncha , Oran , Cahir , Adam , Oran– they were all through the primary schools programme. “It’s crazy to think that that’s the hard work we started nine years ago when we started the programme, recruiting schools and coaching them a bit more intensely in the club, and it’s come to fruition. “People have put in serious effort and not just the players but the coaches, the administrators – people like Ann and Declan Lindsay who give so much to the club in the background. “Declan never misses a match doing umpire and we know how hard it is to do that. It’s the people like that - it is just amazing for them to celebrate the joy of this with us.”  WATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title  A late Cahir McMonigle free sealed victory over reigning champions Greenlough.

I was going to talk about the NI Music Prize when the predictable happens and rant on deaf ears about the unfairness of it all, but I continually vote in it, and it has been quite spot-on in the past, so, maybe I might wise up. Probably not like.

There hasn’t been enough gigs this past year to have a best live act, how they arrived at a conclusion last year is strange but then I may be misinformed. There’s obviously no new bands to speak of so it’s just the two awards this year. I suppose it’s as close to democracy as we can get, but as with everything in the parish, the archaic powers that be hold way too much influence and are too stuck in the past. I’m the guiltiest and have no real business having a say and will keep my opinions to myself from now on. Well after I say that to my ears Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won are the best albums on that list to me and Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government is the best single. I think we should all sit back and appreciate that Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave was recently up for the Mercury Music Prize kiss of death, sadly not winning butit was two out of two losses an outsider would be thinking that there is something really weird going on within the chambers of power up at the Oh Yeah Centre. I named the  nominators to remind myself that my taste really isn’t that important, and I should read my above statement about keeping my opinions to myself. Waiting for things to change in the parish is just something we are great at here. What next, I hear you ask, well there is a group that meets around a table and weighs up the options for the best albums, I’d like to think they do this in a fair manner and once they reach a consensus then the world, who will undoubtedly be waiting with bated breath, will get their answer The same is not true for the single, that is voted for by the public, you, and that’s why those bands were urging you to vote recently. The public vote is now closed so I suppose they know who’s won it by now but they’re not letting on. Rascals.

Here are  to choose from....enjoy! Miami Vice: Saturday, TCM @ pm Michael Manns stylish and action packed update of the famous s TV show about cops taking on drug dealers. Bristling with testosterone, its a moody grown up thriller full of suspense, action and neo-nazis getting shot in the face. Whats not to like about that  Colin Farrell  Jamie Foxx are solid as the leads but Naomie Harris steals the film with one small scene in a mobile home. The soundtrack is wicked too. googletag.cmd.push Portrait Of A Lady On Fire: Saturday, BBC @ pm In Brittany at the end of the th century a painter called Marianne is commissioned to paint a portrait of a woman calledHeacuteloiumlse who is due to be married off to an Italian nobleman. A marriage she wants no part of. Do you fancy a romance that will both uplt you and leave you in absolute shreds  Well here you go. Magnicent turns from Noeacutemie Merlant and Adegravele Haenel carry a sublime story. Rain Man: Saturday, TG @ .pm Charlies father has died and left his fortune to an autistic brother he never realised he had. To get the money him and his brother tear off on a road trip where he finds out about both his sibling and himself. Aspects of Rain Man have dated these days but its still a lovely story of discovery and reunion buoyed by a couple of memorable performances from Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Pawn Sacrice: Sunday, BBC One @ .am  Bobby Fischer vs Boris Spassky. . The chess game to end all chess games. Two grandmasters. West vs East. Some said it was only a game but in a time of cold war its also something far more important than that. Tobey Maguire does fine work as the tragic lead of a well crafted film riddled with paranoia and suspense while Liev Schrieber uses his trademark brooding to intense effect. Walk Like A Panther: Sunday, Channel  @ .am  Their local pub is closing and the only way to make money is toto the lycra and capes. But these folks arent superheroes, nope, they are s wrestlers and aching hips and shoulders arent going to stop them. An entertaining slice of fluff and whimsy from  that will make you feel nostalgic for Saturday morning television. Stephen Graham, Sue Johnston, Robbie Gee and Julian Sands are among the familiar faces having fun. Ladyhawke: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm Nare and Isabeau are in love but they have a wee problem. There was a curse placed on them making him a wolf during the night and her a hawk during the day ensuring they can never be together. The only person who can help is a thief called Gaston. Richard Donners  fairytale is a likable, well made, glorious looking romantic escapade. Michelle Pfefer and Rutger Hauer play the lost lovers and Matthew Broderick has a good time as their only hope. St Vincent: Sunday, Film @ .pm After an incident with his next door neighbour a grumpy old Vietnam vet begins to babysit her bullied son and soon they begin to see the best in each other. A funny, bittersweet comedy that will make you laugh and upset you in equal measures. Bill Murray in the lead is better than hes been in years and Melissa McCarthy as his neighbour does well in a role thats a lot more dramatic than her usual parts. Bridge to Terabithia: Monday, Great! Films @ .pm Jesse and Leslie become fast friends when she moves in next door to him. Soon their childhood imaginations are running riot and the kingdom of Terabithia is created. Real le is sadly never far away though. A little beaut of a movie, one full of lessons about le, both the lovely and tragic sides of it. Anna Sophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both amiable leads. Be warned, this could might will make you cry. Doubt: Monday, TG @ .pm A well liked priest is accused of child abuse. But did he do it  Thats the crux of the tale in an excellent adaption of the famous Broadway play. Philip Seymour Hoffmanis the priest in question and Meryl Streep is the nun investigating him. We get immense performances from both. The subject matter might be hard to take but its compelling and gripping stuff that will stay in your head for days after. Dog Soldiers: Monday, Film @ . A group of soldiers on routine training in the Scottish highlands find themselves under siege from a pack of beasts that should not exist. Neil Marshalls debut film is awesome. Hilarious, horric, quotable, disgusting and damn scary. A rare horror comedy that gets its blend just right. All this and we get a wicked cast too with Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd, Liam Cunningham and Darren Morfitt whos just deadly as Spoon. All The Kings Men: Tuesday, Great! Movies Action @ .am Wille Stark. A real salt of the earth fellow. Liked by all. Well...... Hes a politician, a self taught kind of guy. Hes a decent man, at least he was once, back when he hadnt sold his soul. A deserved Best Picture winner back in , this portrait of the rise and fall of a famous face mixes politics and noir to brilliant effect.Broderick Crawfordand Merceded McCambridge both put in first rate performances. Journeys End: Wednesday, BBC Two @ .pm France. . The trenches of Aisne. A young soldier called Raleigh once who once believed in the importance of war sits surrounded by his comrades in a filthy, rat infested trench as the German army only metres away get ready to attack their front lines. A powerful watch that shows us bullets make no distinctions when it comes to class and social status. Asa Butterfield, Paul Bettany and Sam Clafin do strong work. Nebraska: Thursday, Film @ .am A father and son called Woody and David are taking a trip from Montana to Nebraska to claim a prize. Woody is slowly losing his memory to dementia and David is dragged into the mess. Alexander Paynes comedy drama is a beautully written and crafted look at the complexities of family relationships. Plus it has a couple of wicked belly laughs hidden away. Bruce Dern, Will Forte and especially June Squibb are all on fire. Paths Of Glory: Thursday, BBC @ .pm The men of B-company refuse to make a suicidal run at a German hill during World War . Their general is embarrassed by his perceived failure and sets out to make someone pay. Stanley Kubricks masterful anti war film is an enraging watch, one that shows the toll military le can have on humanity even when the fighting is over. Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax has never been better while George Macready as General Mireau will make you despair. Sam Whiskey: Friday, TG @ .pm Her husband is dead and Laura has a problem. The gold he stole is sitting in a boat at the bottom of the Colorado river and she needs someone to find it andit to its rightful place. Unfortunately she hires the rogue Sam Whiskey for the job. A charming. amiable western is just what you need for a Friday evening and this one led by Burt Reynolds and Angie Dickinson is just the ticket. Youll instantly guess how its going to end but it will keep you smiling throughout. American Mary: Friday, The Horror Channel @ .pm A broke medical student discovers an unusual way to make extra money and finds herself in some very very dark places as a result. This  dark drama horror film starring Katherine Isabelle is a highly effective piece of work. Be warned though, it should probably only be watched by those with a strong constitution butyou can go with it you discover a unique little story that will open your eyes to a whole other world. The Belly Of The Whale: Friday, RTEacute One @ .pm Joe and Ronald. Two loners in a miserable, run down seaside town in Donegal. One has come home after a long time and the other is already there scratching out a miserable existence. They come together with a plan but theres someone venal in their way. A dark dark dark Irish comedy from  that went under the radar at the time but its still worth your time. Michael Smiley, Peter Coonan and Pat Shortt do nice work as three men youd cross four fields to avoid.

We wanted to celebrate that and also remember our dear friend and past pupil, Sonia Kinsella, who died of cancer last year.ldquoWhen we think of her strength and her courage and more importantly, her optimism, this play seemed so appropriate. We hope it pays tribute to Sonia as I think the sentiments this play evokes were embodied in that remarkable lady.ldquoThe play celebrates the strength of female friendship and the incredible support women experience from each other. I think our audiences will find themselves laughing one minute and crying the next.I am so proud of what has been achieved not only in the fact we havenrsquot fallen out despite the dficulties you face when you are trying to work with friends but also the time these busy women have devoted to learning lines and rehearsing while working full time and coping with family responsibilities. It has been hard work but I truly feel audiences will really enjoy the performance.Proceeds from the performances will be in aid of Marie Curie and Assumption Grammar Schoolrsquos sister schools in South Africa.Marcelle said: ldquoThese schools struggle financially anyway but they are experiencing great challenges during lockdown. The money we raise will make a huge dference to many lives there, allowing girls to get access to education and to be offered a meal each day.The provision offered to these students in South Africa can make all the dference to their future.She added: It is wonderful to see the fruition of all our hard work that all stemmed from a conversation during lockdown and that will hopefully benefit others in dferent ways.To purchase a ticket the production, please contact the school reception on   . Tickets are pound each with all proceeds being ided between the two charities.

The website is now live. It is www.redkiteretreat and we are regularly updating our Facebook page @redkiteretreat. For more information please pay us a visit on Facebook, like and share the page.Red Kites were in the area and over a year ago and Stephen started feeding them and as this continued more and more started turning up daily.Red Kites are a bird of prey and have a huge wingspan of up to . metres they are reddish brown with black wingtips and a grey head.They have a distinctive V-shaped tail which they use like a rudder as they twist and turn through the air on thermals and their call is a long whistle.Red Kites are primarily scavengers and a big part of their diet is made up of dead animals , including road-kill. They also follow tractors when ploughing and swoop down to grab any small animals that have been killed by the mowers or brought to the surface.They are no threat to livestock and the largest animal they have the power and speed to kill is a young rabbit. Red Kites, like all other birds of prey, are protected by law and to harm, disturb or kill them is a criminal offence.The new Red Kite Retreat bird hide has already become very popular with wildle photographers and bird watchers and booking a slot is essential.Three generations of the Malcomson family have also helped to plant some of the first of , native trees on a -acre site to create The Warriorrsquos Wood on Dechomet Mountain.The main contractor, Scottish Woodland Ireland Ltd, managed the forest expansion and farm ersication project and planted Irish Oak, Hazel, Holly, Scots Pine and Downy Birch.

The manager of the local service has confirmed that the incident is the first deliberate attack against an on-call GP service in Northern Ireland in the past five years.Mr Mark Armstrong described the

Hynds produced a peerless display aside from that concession, a former Poc Fada competitor, her restarts were struck with precision to wing forwards Katie Black and Niamh Galloway, who in turn fed team captain Joanne Sloane.Straight away, Sloane would angle deliveries into the mobile Maguire. Sloanersquos slick stickwork was impressive, and she had a fine contest versus Bernie Convery throughout.The key battle however, was the dual between Dearg centre back Grainne Glendenning and Belfastrsquos Jessica Rush.With her luminous green boots and helmet, Rush would stand out in any game, but she has the class to back up the bright colours.Winning a huge amount of primary possession, Jessica lsquos jinking, probing runs and vision to find Nicole Clerkin and Niamh Dolan was causing huge headaches for an experienced Ben Dearg defence.Kilcliefrsquos breakthrough goal came in the th minute with Burns finishing brilliantly past Lara OrsquoHare.Clare Kelly and Aacuteine Moynan made timely and brave blocks from Nora Maguirersquos goalbound efforts. The midfield battle was an intriguing and crucial one.Dual star Cara Doran has been on a scoring spree in the football championship this year and she continued her hot streak, with some exceptionally well taken scores from tight angles.Eimear Dorrian was everywhere, covering every blade of grass, never static, always roving, trying to create and make things happen. Dorrianrsquos dynamism and Doranrsquos deadliness contributed hugely to the green and reds display.Niamh McGuigan produced an equally impressive display for the Belfast side. McGuiganrsquos magnetic ability to gain possession in the tightest of spaces is remarkable.Never rushed, despite the chaos around her, she has that precarious talent of always having time, allowing her to scan and assess options, a luxury that only the very top operatorrsquos have.All season, Niamh Daly has also operated at centre field, but cruelly missed out on this final through injury.Brigid Scullion cleverly ped deep to forage for possession, picking up loose ball and linking well with half backs McErlain and Mathers. Kilclief thundered into action with another brace of points from deadly Doran.Her score in the st minute was worthy of the admission fee. Still only  years of age, a career in county colours surely beckons for this gted youngGael.Eimear Breen was a constant outlet for her defence to hit, a player who uses her pace effectively at the right times.With  minutes remaining, Kilclief were edging the contest with a five point cushion. Management Brendan Breen and Seaacuten Paul Doran madetactical tweaks to thwart the increasingly dangerous Clerkin and Dolan axis up front.A double sweeper system was swtly put in place, Cliona Shields and Catherine Deegan were tasked with shutting up shop forming a highly effective shield in front of Ballinascreen stalwart Nicole Clerkin.Nicolersquos space was greatly reduced, but still she battled as hard as possible to cut the deficit. McMullan and Mastersonrsquos masterclass in creating space for goalkeeper Hynds to aim towards, were signicant.McMullan typied the fight and character within the Ben Dearg outfit, as did the industrious Catherine Deegan. Yet, East Belfast pressed with an astounding intensity and relentlessness.That huge work rate comes from having dual players with fierce commitment and blocks of fitness from constant competing, but also from their Bainisteoiriacute Ciaran Hughes and Seaacuten Coulter who encourage their team to play with flair, and they certainly do that, but intense work ethic is paramountyou are to retain a place in this highly motivated team.That competition for places has ensured consistent performance levels all season.Niamh Dolan cleverly created precious space in the congested final third in the th minute, but her angled drive was superbly blocked by Cliona Shields, then swept up bravely by the heroic McMullan, who swtly transitioned to the always available Dorrian.Testament to the synchronisity that is within this Ben Dearg side, Dorrian didnrsquot have to look up to spot the expertly timed run of Burns who showed a deftness of touch to control the sliotar and sail it straight over the black spot.It was a score that comes from playing training together over many seasons. At the other end Aacuteine Moynan and Shannon McWilliams made important blocks, just as Joanne Sloan and Niamh Galloway were about to raise green flags.Clodagh Hanvey made a strong contribution after entering the fray. Maguirersquos maturity and decision making is exceptional for a Gael just turned .With Cara Doran the same age, the future is bright for this Kilclief team. Breen too, displays a shrewd tactical brain, dropping into spaces, covering runs, causing havoc.Doran was awarded player of the match, for her scintillating display, though a case could also have been made for East Belfastrsquos Niamh McGuigan.Niamhrsquos link up play with Jessica Rush was a joy to watch, but equally impressive was her willingness to help team mates in trouble, a true team player.With both teams featuring strong and dynamic forward units, this game was always going to be decided by which defence came out on top.Ultimately, the craft, guile and experience of the Kilclief reargaurd ensured that they closed the game out and got the Championship title they so craved, especially after last yearrsquos heartbreaking defeat to Attical.Euphoric scenes and emotions were unleashed as referee HP McCusker blew his final whistle.Team captain Joanne Sloane spoke from the heart, with a speech that did her club proud. A huge roar went up from the Ben Dearg support whenever she lted aloft the Liam Mac An Ri championship trophy.Each age group at juvenile and now senior level has collected silverware this season, testament to the solid work taking place at their fantastic new facilities in St Malachyrsquos Park.Lorraine MacCartanrsquos priceless contribution in the development of players at the club was highlighted, and deserved praise was duly given to this exemplary East Belfast side.The Ulster Championships now beckon for Kilclief.Referee: H P McCusker .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_kilmore.jpg","title":"Kilmore navigate their way past Maze  ","story":"KILMORE Rec welcomed Lower Maze to Robert Adams Park in the third round of the Peaky Blinders Irish Cup and produced a barn storming second half comeback to progress to round four.With Kilmore two goals down at half-time, having been harshly reduced to ten men after  minutes, the odds were stacked against them.However, a tactical change and a second half performance full of hard work and passion epitomised by man of the match Paddy Grant saw Michael Carvillrsquos men defy those odds and produce one of the most memorable comebacks seen at Robert Adams Park in recent times.Kilmore started brightly but after just eight minutes they failed to clear their lines from a corner, allowing Lower Mazersquos Alex Scott to pick up the ball  yards out and fire through a crowded goal mouth past an unsighted Chris Turley in the Kilmore goals.The task in hand got harder when the referee adjudged Kilmore captain Niall McCarthy to be the aggressor in a midfield confrontation and, to the astonishment of all in the ground, deemed it a red card offence.The injustice of the sending off galvanised Kilmorersquos ten men and they took the game to Lower Maze, dominating possession and creating chances.The first of these saw Caolan Conlon burst through from midfield. His shot was well saved and the rebound fell to Gary Kennedy who fired towards the net only to see Maze lsquokeeper Heron produce a great double save.Cai Gemmel, who was magnicent throughout, saw a goal bound effort deflected wide of the head of a Maze defender as it seemed destined for the top corner.As the chances came and went Kilmore got caught with a sucker punch in the nd minute.Bradford made his way down the left and his mis-cued cross beat a stranded Turley to leave Kilmore two down at half-time and up against it.Carvill changed the shape of the team at half-time and went with a front two of Paddy Grant and Josh Smyth.This change paid idends in the th minute when Grant weaved his way into the box, although it appeared he had been forced too wide, but the forward still managed to fire a rasping drive to the roof of the net.In the th minute a sustained period of Kilmore pressure brought the equaliser, with Grant again involved when his clipped cross was nodded in at the back post by the energetic Josh Smyth.Kilmore continued to dominate and press for the winner, as it seemed as though the game was destined for extra time.In the th minute the pressure finally paid off when Carvill whipped in a corner and that man Grant was on hand to hook the ball home from close range to send the Kilmore faithful into raptures.As Lower Maze then threw everything at Kilmore in injury time, the Blues defence of Magee, Larkin, Kennedy, Stewart and lsquokeeper Turley remained steadfast.Kilmorersquos substitutes of Dagen and Lynas had a chance each on the break for a fourth, but it wasnrsquot to be.Carvill spoke of his ldquoimmense pride in the resilience and determination shown by his side after the match.It came as no surprise that the Kilmore supporters man of the match went to Paddy Grant for his two goals and an assist in a match winning performance.This win sealed double delight for Kilmore, as the club recently secured approval for the installation of a new G football pitch, complete with floodlights, dug-outs, pitch side fencing and associated pathways.Kilmore: Turley, Smyth, Stewart, Larkin, Magee, Gemmell, Conlon, McCarthy, Kennedy, Carvil, Grant.

While Downpatrick has the Fountain Foodbank, Banbridge has a Christian ministry group called J based in the old cinema which will be supporting  families this Christmas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"McKee stands down from UUP  ","story":"MOURNES Ulster Unionist councillor Harold McKee has quit the party.The veteran politician and former South Down MLA has resigned, saying that Doug Beattiersquos leadership of the party is at odds with his religious beliefs.Cllr McKee, who will remain an independent member of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, criticised Mr Beattie for advising members to ldquoleave their Christianity at the door.His resignation comes ahead of next Mayrsquos Assembly election when his wide network of connections across the Mournes area would havebeen a key part of the UUPrsquos drive to secure a seat in South Down.Cllr McKee has confirmed that he intends to serve as an independent ldquoat this point in time with some suggesting that he could potentially be approached by the DUP to join its three councillors on the local authority.He has attacked his former party leader over his stance on abortion, same-sex marriage and a recent vote at Stormont on gay conversion therapy.ldquoIn relation to same sex marriage which Mr Beattie is keen to endorse, I cannot go against the infallible word of God that marriage is between one man and one woman, said Cllr McKee.ldquoI am saddened to observe that these views seem to be of little value in the UUP of today but, rather, a stance of celebrating left-of-centre liberalism seems to be the only acceptable viewpoint.His resignation statement said Mr Beattiersquos leadership was ldquoa far cry from the UUP roots and ldquothe party of Carson and Craig.When Mr Beattie succeeded Steve Aiken as UUP leader earlier this year, he pledged to have a dferent style that would be ldquoable to reach out to all people in Northern Ireland regardless of what your religion is, sexual orientation or ethnicity.Cllr McKee said it was ldquobecoming very dficult to endorse a leader who is constantly to the fore promoting liberal issues while conservative values were being squeezedout. A UUP spokesperson said the party was sorry that Mr McKee had decided his political future no longer lay with the UUP.ldquoWe would like to thank Harold for his service and wish him well for the future, the spokesperson said. ldquoThe party will continue to hold out the hand of friendship as Harold takes a new path.Slieve Croob Ulster Unionist councillor Alan Lewis has described the decision by his former colleague to quit as ldquodisappointing.He continued: ldquoThere are many things that I find myself disagreeing with in all parties, not just my own and sometimes I find that it is better to continue to lobby, talk through and progress these issues from the inside, rather than walk out the door.ldquoThatrsquos democratic politics. Nobody is going to call for the gallows just because your opinion dfers, no matter how rigorous the debate. Unionism demands cohesion with the avoidance of ision.Cllr Lewis also thanked his former colleague for his ldquohelp, support, wisdom and guidance since he was elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.He added: ldquoI will always consider Harold a friend and fellow unionist. He has overcome personal turmoil and, like many of us, has a strong faith which has encouraged and supported him through dficult times.ldquoI genuinely wish him all the best in whatever he chooses to do next.Earlier this year, DUP councillors Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen quit their party over concerns following the election of Edwin Poots as leader.Mr Poots was subsequently replaced by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP and a short time later Cllr Hanna, who also represents the Mournes area, and Cllr Owen, who represents the Rowallane area, rejoined the party..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_pitch.jpg","title":"New £12m sports pitch at Ballyhornan ‘fantastic facility’ for local community  ","story":"BALLYHORNANrsquoS new G sports pitch has been officially opened.The pound.m investment mdash which includes floodlights and ultra-modern changing facilities mdash has been funded by the Northern Ireland Executiversquos Social Investment Fund and Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Located adjacent to the Ballyhornan Family Centre, the new pitch is already widely used and has brought a number of benefits to the community.The Social Investment Fund contributed pound.m to the new development with the remainder provided by the local authority, with the Ballyhornan Community Association playing a pivotal role in helping secure the funding for the new pitch which was completed in October last year.Designed to increase access to community and leisure services by providing a fit-for-purpose, safe and structured environment to meet the needs and expectations of the Ballyhornan community and surrounding area, the new pitch will make a major contribution to help improve the health and well-being of people in the area.Ballyhornan and District Community Association chairwoman, Patricia Curran, expressed her delight to finally have a completed facility after years of rallying to secure funding for the G pitch which can be used all year round.ldquoWe are very grateful to all the statutory bodies and the local council who supported us throughout this campaign. Without them, we would not have achieved our goal, said Mrs Curran.ldquoThis pitch will be a great asset to Ballyhornan and outlying communities and we are very appreciative of this opportunity to provide a top of the range sports facility.Mrs Curran extended thanks to several people who worked with community officials to secure agreement for the new pitch and deliver it.Special thanks were extended to former local council officer Liam McLernon, Cllr Dermot Curran and former councillor Naomi Bailie for their ldquoimmense support.Mrs Curran also highlighted the support of Celtic Bhoys Football Club which uses the new pitch for its home games. She said the clubrsquos support was essential ldquoin making the project a success.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who performed the official opening, said one of the organisationrsquos key objectives was to improve the health and wellbeing of everyone in the district and reduce health inequalities.ldquoThis new facility will become a thriving hub that will have a hugely positive impact on the local area, benefitting the health and wellbeing of people of all ages by offering improved access to modern sporting facilities, she said.ldquoThis fantastic new facility is an excellent example of partnership working between statutory and voluntary groups and the health and wellbeing impact on our community will be immense.South Down MLA Colin McGrath said the official opening of the new pitch was ldquotestament to the work done by Mrs Curran and the team at Ballyhornan, working alongside officials from a number of organisations and elected representatives.ldquoItrsquos a real joy to see a picture of the late Eddie McGrady in the community centre in Ballyhornan who officially opened the building, he continued.ldquoThis latest development should serve as a reminder as to what can be delivered when communities, political representatives and government bodies work together in a common effort. I can only hope we get to see more of these good news stories in the time ahead.Cllr Curran said he was ldquodelighted to attend last weekrsquos official opening ceremony and thanked the funders of the new pitch for their respective contributions.ldquoThese investments are investments in our community and something we should all be very proud of. However, none of this would have happened without the hard work and determination of Patricia Curran and her team, he continued.ldquoGetting to this point over the past  years was a hard road with plenty of potholes, but Patricia never gave up. I am delighted that with help she get over those hurdles. However, had it not been for her dedication, this new pitch development simply wouldnrsquot have been possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_billy.jpg","title":"Politicians say ‘no’ to plan for school  ","story":"A NUMBER of politicians and school principals are opposed to creating a new integrated education college in the area.The proposed -place Mid Down Integrated Collegewould replace Blackwater Integrated College in Downpatrick, providing sixth-form places.Public consultation into the development proposal brought forward by the MDIC steering group ended in September and the Education Authorityhas already given its response to the parentsrsquo group behind the proposal.However, DUP politicians and three of four post-primary schools in the area mdash Saintfield High School, St Colmanrsquos High School and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch and St Colmcillersquos High in Crossgar mdash have publicly voiced their concerns for the first time.Strangford MLA Harry Harvey said: ldquoI am disappointed that despite widespread opposition locally, the Education Authority continue to press ahead with these proposals. The nearby Saintfield High School, a school supported by the entire community, is in dire need of funding for expansion and refurbishment.ldquoI would call on the EA to listen to the local community and support a truly cross community educational establishment that is already in existence.Cllr Billy Walker, who represents the area, said he will not supporting the development proposal, which he described as ldquoill-thought.ldquoAs an elected representative, I will not be supporting the call for an integrated college in the Mid Down area, he told the Recorder.ldquoFirst and foremost, I want to put on record that I am not opposed to integrated education in any shape or form.Cllr Walker said along with Strangford MP Jim Shannon, they lobbied for a new integrated primary school at Drumlins in Ballynahinch and were also instrumental in helping to get the funding to turn Killyleagh Primary School into an integrated school.He continued: ldquoMy credentials speak for themselves. My concern is that we have four post-primary schools in the Rowallane area that have been very successful in the last number of years.ldquoThe four schools are totally opposed to it as this will put serious pressure on these schoolsa new integrated college opens.ldquoThese schools have an excellent track record in working together in a cross-community basis which I have seen at first hand.The councillor claimed he had seen figures to show that Blackwater College was under-subscribed by pupils and local people have made representations to him about the development proposal.He and Mr Shannon recently met with the principals of the four local schools, including The High School Ballynahinch, to hear their concerns.ldquoHow can you honestly push for another integrated school in the Mid Down area when you have another one already under-subscribed, Cllr Walker continued.ldquoIf Blackwater wants to expand, hopefully in the near future Down High will get the go-ahead for its new build which would leave a site for Blackwater to move to. Thatrsquos something I could add my support to further down the line.ldquoBut I will not be quiet on this any longer. I have given a commitment, as has Mr Shannon, to the four schools we have visited that we are % behind their very robust case against which has been submitted to the Education Authority.Tim Jackson, co-chair of the MDIC steering group, said that the development proposal was looking at the future need for an integrated college.The group had already collected  expressions of interests from parents who would send their children to the school,along with  parents who are supportive but donrsquot have children of school age year.He also stressed that the schools had been consulted before the end of the last school year and the public consultation completed by September.ldquoWe feel that people have not understood what our approach and what our proposal is trying to achieve, continued Mr Jackson.ldquoWe are very much about increasing the provision of integrated education in the area, not at the expense of other schools but to support and reflect the support for it in the area and Northern Ireland as a whole.ldquoWe are not about trying to compete with other schools but are trying to deliver something that supports that demand of integrated education. We have had lots of support from local primary schools, many of which are integrated themselves and from other integrated colleges, who you could argue we would be in more competition with.He said that the group had written to every MP and MLA in the area and pointed out that Cllr Walker had not yet been briefed by them.ldquoHe did not take up the opportunity for us to brief him which might have assuaged some of the concerns he has highlighted, said Mr Jackson.ldquoAnd while we are hoping to establish a sixth form, we are not aware that the other local schools have also applied to do something like that.He added that the group were looking at the EArsquos response to the development proposal ldquoin detail as we think that some of our assertions have not been fully understood or appreciated as the EA looks at historical data while we are looking into the future as the urban and geographical landscape changes.Mark Morgan, principal of St Colmanrsquos, described the proposal as a ldquosolo run that disregards accepted protocols and should be dismissed.He added: ldquoIt is imperative that any proposals for change in any sector of the education system must be aligned to the area planning process.Saintfield High School principal Sarah-Lucy Hynds pointed out that irrespective of the proposal, her school would continue to strive for its own expansion.She said: ldquoSaintfield High Schoolrsquos campaign to grow has remained the same for decades. The challenges we face as a result of our capped enrolment at Year  must now be addressed as a matter of urgency.Mr Seamus Hanna, principal of St Colmcillersquos, said he was disappointed with the lack of ldquoproper consultation.ldquoOn a very basic level, the proposal ignored the reality that our staff and students already come from erse faith backgrounds and our ethos is and always has been, pupil centred, welcoming and respecting every pupil, regardless of faith or academic ability, he said.ldquoOn a higher level, it ignored the reality that schools must work in partnership to place student needs above institutional interests. An inclusive and imaginative solution would have received our whole-hearted support, but this current proposal unfortunately fell short of this vision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_smell.jpg","title":"Smell in Downpatrick causes stink with MLA  ","story":"A PERSISTENT foul smelling odour which is prevalent in a large part of Downpatrick is to be addressed by Northern Ireland Water.The utility company is to invest in a permanent dosing plant that will be added to sewage before it is pumped for treatment, with the news welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath.He said he had been lobbying for the odour issue to be addressed and had been working with NI Water to come up with a solution to the problem,The foul smell is noticeable in a large part of Downpatrick including the Ballymote Centre and parts of Killough Walk, Glebetown Drive, Bishops Brae Gardens, Mallard Road, Braeside Drive, Vianstown Road, Cathedral View, Pemberton Park and Pegasus Walk.ldquoEssentially we are looking at a quarter of Downpatrick affected by this odour issue, said Mr McGrath.ldquoIt has been a long road to get to this point, but NI Water is working to come up with a solution. I had previously requested a site meeting with officials to look at the key areas where the issue is most prominent and have been told that talks will take place, alongside some preliminary work.Mr McGrath said this included the continued dosing of sewage at an upstream wastewater pumping station, with NI Water looking to acquire additional land to construct a permanent dosing plant.ldquoSome very welcome news is that a local businessman plans to treat waste generated at his premises before it enters the sewerage system, he said.ldquoThe new system should be up and running in the coming weeks and this is the sort of community activity that Downpatrick does best local people identying solutions and putting their shoulder to the wheel.Mr McGrath said he will continue to seek progress reports from NI Water and keep local people up-to-date with whatrsquos happening.He added: ldquoItrsquos my hope that we are approaching an appropriate and sustainable solution to this long running issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Trust committed to Downe MRI scanner  ","story":"THE districtrsquos most senior health official said she would welcome regular conversations with the public and politicians in helping shape ldquosafe and appropriate services across the area.The commitment by South Eastern Trust chief executive Roisin Coulter came after a meeting she had on Monday with Newry, Mourne and Down councillors.Describing the talks as ldquouseful, positive, open and honest, Mrs Coulter said the health trust was ldquoproud to offer health and social care services from over  facilities across the Down area.She said that since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, all services apart from urgent care have been restored to the Downe Hospital in Downpatrick, where  inpatient beds are open and all outpatient services back up and running.The health chief also issued a reminder that the regional review of urgent and emergency care services across Northern Ireland which is being led by the Department of Health is expected shortly.ldquoIt is anticipated that this review will influence the future of all urgent and emergency care services throughout Northern Ireland, said Mrs Coulter, confirming that the health trust continues to provide a consultant led urgent care centre at the Downe from Monday to Friday between am and pm, alongside a nurse-led minor injuries service on Saturday and Sunday and GP out-of-hours service.ldquoThe urgent care centre has proven very successful with the public and treats an average of  patients every day, the health chief continued.ldquoWe remain committed to the installation of a new MRI scanner at the Downe.

We will continue to monitor this situation closely and will update our guidance to pet owners should the situation change. ”Dr Katherine Russell, consultant medical epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency, said: “Covid- is predominantly spread from person to person but in some situations the virus can spread from people to animals.“In line with general public health guidance, you should wash your hands regularly, including before and after contact with animals.”Cat or dog owners who have Covid- should avoid their pets while infected, experts warned a few months ago.Scientists in the Netherlands found that coronavirus is common in pet cats and dogs where their owners have the disease.While cases of owners passing on Covid- to their pets bring negligible risk to public health, the scientists said there is a “potential risk” that domestic animals could act as a “reservoir” for coronavirus and reintroduce it to humans.Covid-ScientistsSurreyWeybridge  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularNI road closed after road traffic collision - ersions are in placeFamily ‘heartbroken’ following death of founding SDLP figure Austin Currie, a key figure in NI’s civil rights movementMilkman Robert Kincaid, , has been making doorstep deliveries for  yearsDeal between the UK and EU on the NI Protocol is ‘unlikely’ says Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Northern Ireland’s answer to Captain Sir Tom Moore, completes km charity cycle\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.newsletter news people jim-copeland--northern-irelands-answer-to-captain-sir-tom-moore-completes-km-charity-cycle- itm_sourceparsely-api\", Northern Ireland’s answer to Captain Sir Tom Moore, completes km charity cycle\" \"\" width\"\"Jim Copeland , Northern Ireland’s answer to Captain Sir Tom Moore, completes km charity cycleMost PopularRuth Dudley Edwards: A draining Sunday visiting killing sites along the border, then at Lyra McKee filmIan Ogle’s father died ‘without seeing justice’Long delays for M traffic after traffic collisionHelp find missing -year-old Courtney Temple - last seen wearing blackNI High Street Voucher: How long can it take to get spend local card and what to doyou havent received it                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
